Of course, you'll have noticed the money. The Sultanis - a base currency... ..for the heathen ruler of the east. You see, this is how I allow my soldiers to prove their loyalty to me. I toss these Sultanis on the ground before them. And, do you know, the coins are never, ever touched?
Air, water, the continents. So, what is your project about and what are its chances of winning? - Well, my project is awesome. - Oh, good. I took two plants, and I gave them sun and water.
For months, that's what I couldn't figure out. I don't believe in magic, and I knew the government had spent years trying to build something to protect its panicked, little flock. I also thought they'd never pull it off, because I didn't know about you. And you pulled it off, didn't you? Something to watch over all of us.
But we were just learning about the Civil War. And before that, the first Thanksgiving. What kind of order are we going in? Bronwen, everyone knows that history repeats itself, so it really doesn't matter what order you go in, duh. Okay. Who can tell me what this modern-day hieroglyphic is?
She got pregnant in '96. Who was she? Where did she work? She must have talked to someone. I brought the plants in.
That... That right there. You are their Uncle. Yeah. Yeah, and them seeing me kissing you and playing house with you -- well, it's confusing.
How about I let you think about it? I don't need to. I want at least a chance to see my grandson graduate. Like you said... it's big. In medicine, we predict outcomes largely based on precedent because diseases tend to be unoriginal;
It doesn't mean they didn't go meet a dealer. But a drug dealer doesn't call you twice a day for two weeks. Usually you call him. Go ahead, Garcia. The path of my cyber sleuthing has had majestic results.
You could order a Martini or something, Al. Irish whiskey is a little cop part, don't you think? I like the taste my whiskey. How do I look? Suit's a little tight.
Your people are uniquely poised to set an example for the rest of the french quarter. Which is why it's important for the wolves to attend. Thanks but no thanks? Let's hear the man out. The witches are the ones that cursed your pack.
Then don't look at them. Ugh! Ugh, that one! What's that smell? Gangrene.
Look. There. I told you. No talent. The records indicate that you are a highly intelligent man.
Bye. All right, boys, what do you say we change the game to spice things up a little bit, huh? Please, spice it up. The spice is just fine for me. I gotta be honest with you. Mt.
- I love to do that. But it's tricky out there. It's not like when you were... Women are scary now. They're no different than they were when I was young.
She ended up collecting the life insurance money from Tom Yabo's death and moved to Paris. Guess she's getting the independent life she wanted all along. Hey, wait, when was this? We never hugged. Not yet.
You know, when I was a kid, I used to think that there were people in the radio. Like, these little itty-bitty people that climbed in and played on their mini instruments and sang into their tiny microphones! That's stupid. I used to put Scotch Tape around my dolls so I'd know if they moved when I was sleeping. They never did.
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur. If we could kill them at their source... That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures. That is your task.
Janet's writing a total puff piece. And we run those sometimes. Why? Does Boyd's company buy a lot of ads or something? Look, Sara, we can't use these pictures, okay?
It's not about like. It's about fit. You're Deacon Claybourne. You've got a story. These songs?
- Performance reviews. How can you give us {\*performance }reviews if you don't know us? On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me. Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
That's before we were involved. Really? Well, forgive us for feeling that you have not upheld your side of the bargain. Is there anything that Mossad could share with us about the intel on that watch? Maybe if we had some specific leads--
What about what you want? I mean, how can we keep doing stuff like this? Well, that's why I want to get married. It will help me sort my act out. I'm not sure it works like that.
Did you see that? I think they just cut. What? They can't do that. Oh, my God.
But even he can't take it any more. To survive longer, you would need a spacesuit. And in a way, that's what these insects have. Silver ants' armoured skin reflects light. They can tolerate temperatures that would kill any other land animal.
She was kind of shy and quiet. She left her engagement ring on the table. That seems kind of loud. I wanted to surprise her with breakfast and the announcement. I sent it into the paper.
- We'll just blow it out here in Paradise. - Really? Absolutely. We can look hot anywhere. And consider the advantages of looking as hot as we can look in this place.
What's that? - Nothing. - All right. Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie. And my second Bruce Lee movie. And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.
Thierry ! If I don't look, how can I see it ? You should see it in your mind. Actually. Above you there's a handle. A large metallic handle that you could grasp. You could even hang from it.
No, we don't think of you... Ah, bup bup bup bup bup. Mm. That is why I've made up my mind. You guys kindly took me in during a very difficult time.
I try every day to get there. But I've made some mistakes. What sort of mistakes? I took money from my employer. I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.
Did you whip it out in front of the bride, chatterbox? And she wasn't impressed, so you whipped out your knife instead? Look... Yeah, I delivered the cake. I saw the bride and that bridesmaid girl, too.
Would this involve heels? Could. So you have a Frida Kahlo letter and you want to sell it? If it's actually worth anything. My dad gave it to me.
I knew you had these. Did you know that he was pretending to be married to you when he was sleeping on you? All right. That's enough. You were pretending to be married to me and you stole my wedding rings?
He's got evidence all over him. Yeah, when we're done I'll make sure he gets to you, okay? Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Hey. Brass found Nelson's truck about a block from the crime scene.
The gamble the crowned eagle took months ago by nesting here has paid off. She is the only eagle to actually nest in this forest. The only one who took the risk to breed here, well before the trees came into fruit and the bats flooded in. She only breeds once every two years, so her timing must be perfect. In a few months, the bats will leave, but her gamble means her chick will have the best possible start in life.
- Look, Danny, you have always seen the world as-- - What? Black and white? Good and evil? No, you're wrong.
Oh, wait a minute. What are those things hanging down next to the windows? They're ugly, is what it is. Ugly and old and make the house look cheap. You saying the house looks cheap?
Well, they're going to want to question you for, like, 12 hours. They do like to question. I'm just going to tell 'em that I stumbled upon Raul's suicide during the course of the investigation. Walter said it wasn't suicide. His hands are on the steering wheel.
Is there anything we should know? Mr. Munk? A few years ago, I hunted down my birth mother, but she had passed away from colon cancer. How old was she? 32.
Thank you. You don't value your life enough, throwing it away for revenge. You got too much good in you. Wonder. Things in me now aren't the things I came up with.
Women like that I can anticipate their needs. They're used to guys doing the bare minimum. I go above and beyond. Try it sometime. You're hunting them.
Joseph! Put the knife down! He's getting what he deserves. Joseph, put down the knife. Put it down!
Se Ra and I are living together. This time, I'm the owner. So, you're happy? To me, this is bad news. Really.
It is amazing. So what was the real birthday plan? I was listening. A bit. Well, Evan and I put ourselves on a budget, so I was thinking small.
Just as soon as she finishes bobbing her hair. That will be all, Philip. Now, at the ripe age of 27, Miss Duncan... I've a meeting. I'll be back in a few hours.

The board actually thinks it sells the image-- genius, iconoclast. I can't do it. It's just one speech out of about eight others they're gonna hear today. It's not that big of a deal. I'm not talking about the speech.
♪ screw 'em blind, they don't mind ♪ ♪ 'cause Jacko's king of the night ♪ I got to take a piss. Hey, take one of these whores with you, Jenkins. They'll aim it for ya.
You sent the car back. What? In a world full of people trying to get something off me, you sent the car back. I love that. (Scoffs) No, you love that I'm not your wife.
Should have known they'd plant a LoJack in one of them bags. Sharp guy, that Jerry. He'll be a fine replacement for me. Right. Well, in one of those lockers, there was a tablet.
Why didn't you just say no? Say no. Why? I don't want you working with Clovis. You don't want me working with him?
I know it looked suspicious, arriving like that. It came from a former employee. It'll just be a few days. But a zombie is a zombie, right? But this one is almost human.
Paul Montgomery was alive when he was dragged. And it turns out Paul worked the late shift nearby. My officers found blood around his vehicle. He was probably blitz attacked when he left work. Did we find his cell?


Well, then you'll have it. Is that Voulez? Wow. Margaux must have made quite the impression to get you to read what you called, "a rag about nothing but dresses and hair." I shouldn't have judged this magazine by its cover.
We had a drink together. Was she alone? She came alone. She didn't leave alone. I spent the night with her.
Let's get started. Helping you find your happiness, saving you... That's what's gonna save me. This isn't your pixie dust, is it? Well, when you think about it, does anyone really own pixie dust? The fairies are quite proprietary about it.
Cousin Claire. This is freaky! I'm getting something else. Two women died in this house. Kristin just said that.
I'm interested in one specific exchange where you introduced Noelle to feast delivery service. So you knew the delivery-service times, and you also knew about Noelle's allergy. Given your actuarial skills, I'm wondering if you can help me analyze some research I've gathered. Uh, between women and men, women take their time to plan a murder, while men are more... impulsive.
Looks like you won't be getting your lesbian after all. Yeah, we'll see. Can I just say something? I know that you all think you're being all open-minded by electing these two homecoming queens, but I think you all should know they're not really lesbians. Lauren, give me the microphone.
We've been out for a drink. That's it. Tom, you know your ship? - Yeah. - Could it beat a whale?
Oh. Hi, Dr. Owens. My son posted on his Facebook page that he has a bullet in his lung. It's kind of cool, right? I mean, I'm like a medical mystery. Actually, the going theory is that you breathed it in as a kid.
♪ Start the revolution ♪ In Washington, DC, we had a very, very active women's liberation movement. I think we met every single day for something or other. We had this organizational structure with all the different groups. We didn't want it to be hierarchical, so we decided on the name Magic Quilt.
- Thanks. I don't. So she can't give us any information. When Valkyries are reborn, their memories come back slow and scattered. And apparently their hair full and lustrous.

Hello, Mother. To what do I owe the pleasure? Well, I have some news, and I wanted to tell you in person. What's that? I'm selling the house.
The ocean is everywhere furrowed by whirlpools, some of which run for years. This movement spreads heat from the surface of the blue planet. The warm water from the tropics rises toward the poles. This water cools, becomes even more compact and is loaded with salt back into the depths. The water travels through the depths towards the bottom of the ocean, propelled by its own weight.
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo, the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead. When permission is granted from Papa Samedi, the keeper of the cemetery, she'll visit, and she'll dig up a corpse. Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs are indispensable for use in ouangas. This is horseshit, isn't it? She cured my prick. She wants to know what you want.
- What? Vargulf. A wolf will only attack if it's hungry or if it's provoked-- if it's normal. A vargulf is a wolf that's gone insane. Insane how?
What is this place? You are at U.S. Cyber Command in angel's bluff, Virginia. Virginia? Is that where I live? It's where you work.
Well, if there's hardly any slots... well, let's not write our own rejection letter quite yet. You probably have a better shot than most people. Mr. Fitz, I don't swim anymore. No, I'm talking about your work outside of the pool. These little colleges are looking to build communities.
- Without permission? - I'm not the guy who gets permission. Two helos. Any backup? It was two years ago.
Get this guy to translate faster. Neal, listen, I need you to give serious and immediate attention to the website. Are we down? I would have been alerted. No, it's up and running, but it's not--
It was a total waste of time. Life... Is meaningless... Full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. Bill Shakespeare understood that, but it was Bill Norquist who really opened my eyes. I mean, this guy shows up to me out of nowhere with a gun and a simple proposition... kill my wife for $2,000.
Lexy, get down from there! That was Hotch. The doctor told him the placenta was scraped completely out of the victim's uterus. Every bit of it. You know, the placenta does carry special significance in many cultures.

When they arrived back at Nasse House after their marriage, all of the servants, who were new, including the butler, barely caught sight of her that first evening. And the following morning, the woman that they met was not Hattie Stubbs, non, but this Italian made up to look like Hattie, behaving as Hattie. But Hattie, the real Hattie, was dead. She was killed the first evening she arrived here by your son. Oui. By your son, madame, James Folliat.
They duped my client of eighty lakhs it's in the bag... ls this correct uncle? Yes Come on then, to the police station Just wait and watch now Tarn... I will get the maximum sentence for her...
They're... they're doing a story on us. We're not gonna be paying for those afterwards. Hi, me again. Where are the bathrooms? Are they by the, uh, elevators to the important offices?
It's a long shot, but may as well see if the tires match. Is this the stolen sport bike? Yeah, it looks like it. All right, let's find the super. My son, my son!
- This place. Right here, check it out. It's pretty sweet, right? Off 10th Avenue. Mmhmm.
Lucky guy. Yeah, well... We'll see how it goes. It's new. He's a contractor.
Mas pode não ser no futuro. As rosicrucians, we know the most important thing For us to do now is to preserve that  <hon>thing<hoff>  That lies in the tunnels below this cathedral. We can't do this. A hundred generations have kept it hidden. We're not worthy to make this decision.
Now, everyone please pay attention and stay upright. Well, three people, including you with a carrier, you three can start from over there. Understood? And the rest, starting from here, please walk well youselves. Understand? Yes. Is the light ready?
Yeah. Playing with breasts that aren't attached to someone I hate. (Laughs) What? ! Aah! (Laughs) His humor makes me uncomfortable. They're fine. Baby, I am so sorry I left you hanging with the guys.
Or wits. That's very clever. Moving on. I didn't even want the goldfish, but my date insisted I give it a proper home, which meant something nicer than the plastic bag that it came in.
Unlike solo vigilantes, they're working in concert and they're planning and executing coordinated attacks. Their mentality is like a lynch mob. They believe the justice system has gone wrong and it's up to them to set it right. Due to the pre-planning and level of commitment, we believe our unsubs are over 30. And they probably learned about the crimes they're avenging through the media.
Yes, ma'am. If that's true, we got more problems. Who is "we"? These are mothers who have also sent their sons and daughters extra body armor. So either somebody starts answering our questions or we start asking them in front of TV cameras.
Besides, we get to go to Miami. That's a fun place, right? I guess. So cheer up. This is gonna be our last case together.
Fake? ! I see it all the time. That-that's why we do the scratches... to test the paint. Ferrari has a patent on their colors... Made only for them.
What do we know? 11 women have come forward to report they were snipped by this guy. Including the dead girl? Yeah. I got my guys doing welfare checks on the other ten. But we need to assume that there are more women out there that didn't report it.
And you had nothing that would tie Gabriel Waincroft to the gun? Nothing. So, in other words, that was the end of your case? Over the years, we followed up on a lead or two, but nothing ever came of it. But you always suspected that Gabriel Waincroft was guilty, didn't you?
! Oh, my God! Burn! You can take my draft pick, but you can never take my Shiva! No. This season never happened.
Unless, of course, another witch... Say, a traitor to the cause, Katie, for example... Was to perform much more powerful magic at the same time. That would create a smokescreen concealing your very small spell from Davina. Katie doesn't deserve to die. You're in no position to be so principled.
- ( Chuckles ) - I did! I mean, you know, more than normal. Look, I... The book took a lot of time and commitment from you, from me, from the kids, and I'm very proud of what you did. But I thought that when the book was done...
- You enjoy being fishhooked? - I've never been fishhooked. - Take a guess. - Probably not. Definitely not. Nobody wants to be fishhooked.
- I mean Dani, LC-- - You. Homicide assigns killers to investigate their own killing? We don't come back from that. They'll burn this damn city to the ground.
And that's what we'll have to do with these sheep. We gotta prove to them they have nothing to fear... Oh, at this rate, we'll never get any milk or eggs. Just as I feared. We haven't had time to fully stock the food storehouse.
He came to help buy back the car I sold. Why? It's complicated I can keep up, Ezra. Technically, the jag wasn't mine to sell.

I can have her in court in an hour. Okay. Let's do it. Someone got flowers. Ooh.

Miller - family. Who are they and where were they? Beth had Chloe, their eldest daughter, when she was 15. Mark was 17. Mum and daughter were at home watching telly.
- Mmm. Learn to lighten up. Learn to like the little things in life. Like this cot. Mmm? This cot is awesome.
No, but that was child's play. The true, once-in-a-lifetime, "write a chapter in your memoirs" adventure had to be, hands down, the peyote circle in Belize. Oh. Three ambassadors, two heads of state, one rolling stone -- my lips are sealed. The hash month in Amsterdam would've been memorable, but I can't remember it.
- No, no, you're confused. Ivan, it's you that's the bastard. It's the baby that's the bastard. For God's sake, Ivan, at least get the word right. Katrina, listen.
Kid's scared to flush. Think's it's his brother. Can we focus on my son up in the sky? Oh, I've got a long-shot idea. By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance.
'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won. Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money. There is not. The free market is a jungle. It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.
In addition to the compass, of course. What the hell? That... would be Jack. As in Jack... the giant killer. With that toothpick?
- Well, Y'see? Odds're against you there, babe. Mom believes women don't grow more attractive with age. Oh, I disagree, I.. - No..
Dennis Hopper is dead, TV shows give no time for theme songs anymore, and Woody Allen did the voice of a cartoon ant. Sorry, I lose track of how big I'm getting. I don't. You vandalized private property.
Much nicer paint job. No bullet holes in the door. That thing was a nightmare, huh? It was primitive. You know, whenever I hit a red light, I used to pray it wouldn't crap out on me.
I am descendant from no god. Nor man of lofty note. I'm tolerated within the Senate solely for the wealth I have amassed through labor and dealings those with "proper" lineage deem beneath them. And you believe this singular cause why they hate you, hmm? Your campaign against Mithridates and um other adventures.

Bud and Sam have any leads? They think it might be a case of road rage, but Carrie's parents won't allow the bullet to be removed, so without it... Bud and Sam are stuck. Maybe, maybe not. I've been going over the measurements of Carrie's car.
That's a shame. Leanne, I feel free as a bird. No, like, not even a bird, like a snake! More like a snake. Like an anaconda.
Well, how do we get to them? How can we get to them? We could try the maintenance shaft. It's sealed on both sides, so you'd have pressurization. And it's pressed right up against the fuel pods.
This shit is salty enough without your tears in it. You wanna take a break? Ven. What's looking good today, Bennett? I'm a hungry man.
This woman's been attacked by an ostrich! Ah, Tobias got a new girlfriend. Tobias had acted like an actual superhero - and saved Lucille 2. - There's my hero.
There was a scuffle, and he was dead, and you were just... you were there. We didn't mean to kill him. You stole my life and then you stole my play. Armitage wanted to run Ripper! I found your first draft.
Agent Coulson, it's going to be all right. We found your people. The train, it's ... - Wheels up in five. - You okay?
No, man. Charlie used to sleepwalk. Locked himself in. Hell, he was just eating barbecue yesterday. How could somebody die in a day just from a cold?
Why--why nothing. What do you want? The artifact removal detection system-- Oh, yes, repurpose sensors that are already in place. Of course.
You know what, Pam? Why don't I check out Mel, and if we do need you, we'll come get you? How are you feeling? Tired. Huge.
There's a border where one ends and the other begins. Voyager 1 reported back to Earth that its detectors were being pummeled by more and more cosmic rays. Until then, we didn't know where the interstellar ocean began. Voyager 1 pressed on past a boundary we had never crossed before. The heliosphere shields us from most of the deadly cosmic rays.
Jesus, they're multiplying. That's Kyle. - He's a little shit. - Eh. Be grateful. Boys are little shits when it doesn't matter.
All right, well, come on. Maura's mad at me, so let's give her a cheap thrill, and she can comparison-test the cake knives. meet me at the elevator. What's up? You know how I drove Frost's mom and her roommate around?
I am acutely aware that you were on the scene, lieutenant. And instead of assisting in that operation, you shot major Douglas with a tranquilizer dart. A superior officer. And I think that that's just the tip of your iceberg, Leeds. You see, I think that you've been keeping secrets from me.
Who introduced you? A tiny Jamaican crab? I should get going. Look, that was never gonna work. Women don't love me because I have a girlfriend.
A man could get robbed. Or even killed. You threaten my father again, I'll kill you myself... on this road. You hear me? My quarrel was with your father.
Remarkable. It is the same. - What? Same weapon? - Same scrunchie.
Come on, man. This is your chance to be the hero. - I don't know, David. - Don't do it for me. Don't even do it for you. Do it for the girls. For Rose and Casey.
It was certainly in a lot better shape than our old hunk of junk. Much nicer paint job. No bullet holes in the door. That thing was a nightmare, huh? It was primitive.
No problem. Great. And that... is how you do that. Tough surgery. I don't know what you saw from up in the gallery,
Um... that's because I have a lot to do. Guys. We've gotta get past this. French fries, burgers, and a grilled cheese. Do you know what a fatty diet will do to your endurance on the court?
Not even mom. But I understand. So wait. While--while we're sitting here talking, are you thinking about-- Killing you won't make me feel any better. It's those women.
And that's what happened. What does women's lib mean to you? I think they have a lot of good points. Extremely fine points. The abortion laws are ridiculous. The fact that, uh, unequal pay... that's ridiculous. - They're not after your job?
Her charger's here but the phone is not. Maybe it's with her? Yeah, I'll have Garcia track it. It'll only work if it's on, though. It's worth a try.

Life is a test. You have murder in your heart. That's a fact. I've been carrying it there for many years. What do you need to know?
All right, first of all, cross your legs. Okay, second of all, I don't know how Excuse me, brotha. you managed this, but I am not signing for this food. You tell 'em, sister. Bruddah, you call these jumbo shrimp?
Of course. Yeah, you know we'd do anything for you. I'm counting on that. We like your plan. You'll get your reward Friday.
Betty, aren't you leading him on? Why would you say that? You're telling me your heart's in this? This is what girls do. They date boys.
(Woman speaking indistinctly over PA) Think you can beat up on my kid? Think again, Neal Segal. Let's just find your parents. (Clicking, bell chiming) What's wrong? Get this tray away from me.
Well, you have the phone numbers of the plants, don't you? - Yeah. - Call them now, Donal. Call every one of those bastards, get them to repeat the order. C6 on the nose or we send those trucks back.
- Then what is? To enter into their game. I have the advantage over my adversaries in that I know what cards they hold whereas they are oblivious to my hand. Do you see this spider's web? Big, isn't it?
I can see you following in my footsteps someday. George must be so proud of how hard you're working. Honestly, I haven't seen much of my dad lately. No? In fact, George's romance with Eden... Was entering its second trimester, and I still hadn't even met the woman.
Stop! Outside, my life was a mess and I hurt a lot of people. But now I'm clean and I'm learning new things. And I finally have a family too, so... Thank you.

Yeah, if it wasn't for that cash, uh... club would've been closed tonight. Sorry to keep you waiting. And without a stack of old National Geographics, like a proper doctor. David's still prepping the last victim, but here's what we have so far. Kevin Ellis. C.O.D.'s intracerebral hemorrhage due to multiple blunt force trauma.
And it seems like it's always on the brink of a fight, but it's really not. If you're a true ballplayer, you might talk all that trash, but the bottom line is that's part of the game. What the fuck? I hit the ball, though, Doc! You came over the back!

Al-Zuhari will not tolerate it. Who says crime doesn't pay, huh? I got 4 on the towers. I got at least 6 on the ground. Am I right in believing that Samuel has paid you for the arms shipment which you agreed to deliver a week ago?
Then this won't take long. Robert? Robert, are you here? Why were you the one the girls would bring home? I guess they thought they could fix me.
- Let's do this! You know what would be great? Some more of those strawberry blintzes you made last week with a little powdered sugar. - Those did make you smile. - Oh. If I could offer one tiny critique...
Just like the slug we took out of the wall. That's not all I found: fingerprints on the windowsill. Killer saw quite a show. I found semen stains.
- Facebook wasn't really a thing yet. - How old are you? I'm fine. I'm young. Don't worry about me, okay?
Personal security uses a method called "arm's reach." In an attack, if you're closest to the client, you shield them. If you're closest to the attacker, you focus on the threat. One man tries to defend against danger, and the other one tries to find it. Of course, if personal security has to get involved, something's already gone very wrong.
You do understand that when I say, "We have your print," it means that there is no "get out of jail free" card that works here. Your print on an explosive that killed a man is a nail in your coffin. You killed Zorlov because you think he had something to do with Michael Byrne's murder. Look, Mr. Byrne was always good to me and my mom-- always.

It's spacious, safe, gives good mileage.. ...and it's a practical car. Yeah, practical. Beautiful. That's the favorite word of the girls.
Yeah. So, Alexis, I, um... I found your vlog, and while it is super cute, um-- Yeah, gram told me. You think I'm catnip for predators online.
And that's it-- no pressure. Nobody's doing anything wrong here, Alicia. This is how America works. So you're familiar with this Web site? It's not sanctioned by our league.
I loathe that song. But why did you bite poor Birdie's head off? Because I've heard it more times than I care to. It haunts me. Just stop, for a moment.
Well, maybe it is. But so what? I mean, haven't you ever watched HBO? No. Well... neither have I. But I get the gist.
The only man that you ever really truly loved. And you destroyed him as well! Leave him out of this, Wendy. The girls don't know about that one, either, do they? What have you told them about their father?
When I landed, Mission Control was still saying "Maybe it's just a transmission delay." But, by the time I made it into Mission Control, we were looking at over 15 hours of dead feed. After James was lost, the joy of the mission, the exhilaration of it all just... it just left. I stopped feeling like a kid on a family trip.
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed over a neighbourhood, even a city. Theoretically, you could cure polio in an afternoon. That's incredible. Well, others disagreed. What if the device were loaded with a toxin? What if you wanted to opt out?
Okay. Tell you What. You look over there, and I'll look over here. We have to be methodical. Skull retrieval requires the use of physics, anatomy... and the careful reading of geological terrain. That sounds like it's gonna take a long time, and I gotta-
And those people were Wendell's parents. That is... Absolutely ridiculous. You can't prove any of it. Your D.N.A. was on the prosthetic eye that Wendell stole.
So you decided to bring one of the chickens home? Well, there are two combatants in a cockfight. I could have called Animal Control. But it occurred to me, we have an opportunity. There's some debate as to whether these creatures, once perverted by their keepers, can be weaned from their aggressive tendencies.
What about the drive up to pittsfield when we stopped at sturbridge village? Remember? We had fun. We saw a candle being made. I didn't really care about that candle, Henry.
Until Knox stepped in. Together, we put those good ol' boys down like dogs. That's a true blue friend. Except he got a shattered knee for his efforts. One guy just got the drop on him.
Now's a good time to set some ground rules about coming and going. Oh, you know what? That reminds me. Has somebody removed a box of vintage pornography? I had been looking after it, you see.

My brother is dying, and all I want to do is give him my blood to save him, and now, as he is bleeding out, now, the law which has been so silent when we needed you, now the law rears up to tell me that I can't save him?

Hey. How about... "No"? But what if I told you something about dad and Jane that would make you very happy? Then could I? Why, you little finagler. How do I know your information is even worth the fine Belgian chocolates that I have hidden in the pantry?
I thought so. Ooh. I have the, uh, rental van on traffic cam footage from yesterday an hour after the shooting, turning east on Saticoy, 1400 block. That's about half a mile from the restaurant. Checking the first Saticoy cam and one on another street due west.

If they ask you, we walked home together and stayed out for a while. We went home together. Good afternoon, madam. I hope this is the right address. We brought you flowers because you called the police... and thereby saved the life of one of our best friends.
I disagree. - Be safe. - Okay. See you soon. The bullet missed major organs, but I am not buying that you just dug it out. - Is it in there?
A premonition. Call it what you will. A calamity for justice, of course. Now, we can fret about it, become indignant, write an angry letter to the newspapers or our Members of Parliament. Won't make any difference.
Do you know what's bloody priceless? I get to live like the king of Siam for a month, me Sophie gets $5,000, and, best of all, the public gets the satisfaction of seeing someone hang for this heinous crime.

So scientists want to know if there is something that connects them. Both women belong to an exclusive club dubbed the "Wellderly". Researchers here at Scripps Health are investigating whether there is something in their genetic code that sets them apart. They're comparing their gene sequences against those of people who have died from age-related diseases, before the age of 80. They've identified one particular gene that might play a crucial role in determining lifespan.

No, no, no, just to get a confession. [ Sighs ] We found Stroh's little cemetery. We caught him red-handed, trying to murder that boy, and I just rattled his cage pretty hard. A-a-and if he sees that Hobbs has that cap with his DNA in it, that's gonna push him right over the edge. Please.
I found it. The perfect place for the amphitheater. Okay, so this morning, a squirrel stole my toothbrush. Actually, I chucked it at him to get him off my windowsill 'cause he was staring at me, and then he took it. So I chased after him and I cornered him against this tree.

I feel sure they would like to see them. And maybe touch. Just a little. Perhaps I could help. Our very finest gowns are so precious that only Miss Audrey may touch them, even Mr Moray is forbidden.
It should. These merchants felt constrained by their governments who wrote the laws and levied the taxes, so they formed a secret pact. They called it Hourglass. You see the skull. It's distorted, the artist's way of telling us,
A lot of them were his customers, so he flipped, started threatening everyone. But that just made 'em laugh harder. Short guy teased and bullied his whole life. That kind of humiliation, he'd do anything to make them stop laughing. Looks like he did something that got him killed.
- Can you pass the mustard, please? - Yeah. Oh, it's easy when you've got so much in common. Last night, for instance, we both got a case of the munchies, and then we went out and we stole these pies... As it turns out, they did a lot more than steal pies. They had a raucous good time.
It should be men saying, "Yo, brother. That's really a macho attitude you're taking. You need to check your shit." And that's what happened. What does women's lib mean to you?

Otherwise, how could he have seen us in the car? Why were we given a second chance if it was always supposed to end like this?

- It's Pennsylvania. What I can't tell you is what kind of animal left Lisa Willoughby here or what direction it came from. Of course, there's been nearly a week for the tracks to degrade, but... we're still talking about an animal of sufficient size to drag a 60-pound load an unknown distance.

I assumed that all electrical power, if we were successful, would be generated by nuclear means. In the '50s there were essentially two kinds of reactors being developed. The breeder reactor, which EBR-1 was a prototype for, and the light water reactor. The breeder reactor breeds plutonium and can recycle it over and over again It's a very good fuel. [ chuckles ]
The account Ari mentioned is on a secure VPN. You put the money in, and it gets walled off. It's only accessible through a dedicated satellite uplink. So, we drop in the money and we track it. Birkhoff can find it through satellite.

Even before I went to Glynco and trained to be a dead shot, I seen people kill one another, and I learned to be ready in case they came after me to do me harm. In other words, I'll kill four of you before you even clear your weapons and I'll take my chances with the other two, and you see this star?

South Carolina's premiere military college. They taught me the values of honor, duty, and respect. They also hazed me, tried to break me, and, senior year, nearly expelled me when I volunteered for a Senate Race and my studies suffered.

Some of my favourite scenes, which also seem to be fans' favourite scenes, between Amy and Sheldon, do not play that way all week.

There's something wrong with the king's eyeball. Wait, what are you talking about? You're right. It's, like, droopy and puffy. Yeah, I had a buddy that had one like this.
Until she found her new boyfriend Marcello. Can you believe it? My mother has a boyfriend. And he's insisting that I leave today to spend a long weekend with them at his villa in Tuscany. He sent his jet.
We have a storage unit in town. Take it there. It's just a few days. My friend will pick it up soon. Lock it up.
My family never made any home movies with me. I was the fourth kid. My father was fond of saying I was the fourth of three. Hey, I can always photoshop you into mine. Here, Charlie, we got you a 45-year-old bald man for your birthday.
How could you go to Madrid this evening if we were in Mexico? - Ulloa, mind your own business! - I lied to her. But, given the circumstances, I'd feel better if I called her. Everyone will hear what's said on the other end. I suppose you don't mind.
Thanks. When I was little, I found this comic book in the trash. I'd never seen girls who looked like that. They were like Disney princesses, but prettier. I liked tracing the drawings a lot.
And a half-brother is better than nothing. I like having a brother. Dad was cool to bring me here. - Dad? Dad brought you here? - Uh-huh. I was upstate, in the woods.
- Yes, Eden? No, I mean, why would I call you miss Franklin? I thought we were friends. [Laughs] Friends, huh? Well, a friend doesn't keep secrets from a friend.
Uh, this is my private number. - I-I really don't-- - I know. I know this is a difficult time, and I'm sorry to bother you, but have you thought about sharing your story? No. Because people draw strength from reading about survivors like you.
Are you gonna leave again? Yeah. I can't come back anymore. I went to Aiga, and... Stay here...
We're doing it in this Collider, and we're reproducing that so we can see what it was like when the universe just started. This is what we tell people. Okay, answer two: we are trying to understand the basic laws of nature. It sounds slightly more mild, but this is really where we are and what we're trying to do.
- Mmm. - What, you didn't... Know it was missing? It was never delivered. I ordered it from a dealer, Nick Castigan at Heritage Classics. He said they would deliver it to me.
On the... It says C6. What does it say on every piece of paperwork and on every sign-off sheet? - It says C6. - It says C6. And you know why?
I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count.
Stabilizing at 70%. I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. What was that? I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint.
It was about 10:00. He didn't tell you that, did he? Were both cars home? Well, I'm not spying on the guy or anything, but we were out here a little later. I noticed his car was gone.
But if we did, did they at least die peacefully? No. Hey, honey? Hmm? That Brenda was quite a crackpot. But she put the girls' minds at ease.
Yeah, in rehab, months ago! Yeah, that's true. I never followed up. And I did tell you it was a done deal, and... and then when I tried to call I couldn't get ahold of him, so... I got a bad habit of that, sweetheart.
He probably spends that on hair gel. DANVILLE: I don't know. Feels more like strategy to me than charity. You think? (crowd chatter, Kemp laughs)
My brother was extremely talented, but he went his own way. My family values achievement. Charles was a dreamer. Did you notice anything unusual about your brother's behavior recently? Full disclosure -- there was a dispute over some money my grandmother left.
I beg your pardon? I'm still very sexy. Thank you very much. - Yeah, you're about as sexy as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae. you and me both. Look, wouldn't we be better off all of us, if we stopped lying about these things, ..and told the truth?
She had this done a while ago. And the tattoos and the piercings are even older, right? Her body...it's a record of her journey into body modification. How does that track with her leg being forcibly amputated? Well, that's your job.
Say quick: Does she now think I am a murderer? She weeps and weeps. And lies upon her bed, and... and then jumps up and cries out, "Tybalt," and then, "Romeo." My name was fatal to her from the start.
Just go back further. Only I'm a little bit worried, because if we find him, he might be very disapproving of talking to the papers. Families are private things. I know. Go and stand back there.
You're an adonis. Steve, go make yourself useful. Get some pictures of him playing tennis and rock climbing. Billy, just be yourself. Billy, women don't want you to be yourself.
- Yes, you could! You chose to do nothing! I stood by and watched on the sidelines once too, and I still think about it, but this was your daughter. You can't arrest me. Oh, I can arrest you.
- No. I don't think so. Who can tell at that place? What happened? One of the girls asked me to punch out her time card and we got caught. I told you, those girls aren't your friends.
Can we figure it out later? Whenever you're ready. Rough night? Yeah. My head is killing me. You?
There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret leaving him there. What do you think the girls are gonna say when I tell them that you left their brother behind? - Stop it. - Oh, that's right. It doesn't really matter, does it?
- I don't usually. - Get him a Blue Label. Actually, I would have loved to be a musician, but I have no musical ear. I guess the law allows me some control. It's a way of putting the world in order, even if it's only an illusion, isn't it?
¿Quien es ese, señor? Be ready. What was that? Said he heard we were investigating an overdosed American girl, so why the hell are we poking around the blood of the cartel? Right. You know, the way the blood is flaked in these treads tells me this blood pool was dry when the truck drove through it, and that was at least a couple hours after the massacre.
Just somewhere far away. - I'm just sad, Cam. - I am, too. You know, I had our mornings all planned out. The baby and I would walk Lily to kindergarten and then cut back home through the park and feed those ducks that you're not supposed to feed but everybody does.
My dad does it. He's one of the best taxidermy artists on the west coast. But enough about stuffing dead animals. Sit down. I'm gonna tell you a little story about real, living things.
- expensive German sports cars. - Don't disagree. It's where men with defective equipment have pumps installed so that they can leave their wives for a yoga teacher. Okay, come back to me here. This is an invasion.
- Looks like you already did. - Ah, "five star service, and I was very impressed that my mechanic spoke fluent Mandarin." Oh! You're more than kind. Thank you. I was obsessed with the death mask for so long,
Something I can do? You ever fight a woman? Depends. Business or pleasure? Look, they do say crazy makes you strong.
This is an upwelling flow. It circulates the water and provides nutrients. Seals and birds hunt the small fish around the rising water of life. The Chileans fishing with trawls, very long tubes that are closed, collect just over 40 tonnes per load. Five hundred thousand fish in each net is sucked into the machine.
- Come with me. - Hi. - Hey. You look beautiful. Thank you for the flowers.
I don't think I'm old enough to have a family of my own and be married. It feels ridiculous. I'm in high school. This is so stupid. I can't believe I'm crying.
The bishop is no fool. He offered money to the Indians who baptised - their children. - They must have been easily persuaded. There were 60 conversions in a week. A miracle! In the Middle Ages, the Church distributed indulgences.
Brenda. I need your help. No. I need your help. You were in the murder room today. You saw the pictures of those women.
This is one of those fancy, high-tech sports watches that reads the victim's heart rate, GPS location, and even the altitude. Notice how the victim's heart rate was elevated for close to two minutes prior to flatlining. A person's maximum heart rate is approximately 220 minus their age. Melinda was 32 years old and her heart rate peaked at 186. So, maybe she was running from someone?
With pleasure. Does this girl look familiar to you? I've never seen this girl, but this mark I have seen. I hope I never see it again. I don't know who's behind it, and I don't want to.
The city sprawls across the country, but its fortune is thanks to the fact that it meets the ocean. The ocean planet is my planet. But if we're ever wrong? The ocean whence we came, now seems so far away. Within only 200 years we violently disturbed four billion years of natural history.
like the furies coming down to punish orestes. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? Was...washe theguy who stabbed out his eyes? God,that's oedipus, you dumbass! The furies are deities of vengeance.
Harry, he never liked the band. You were having an intimate relationship with Mr Lester weren't you? He was a friend of mine. You were having a sexual relationship with him? I'm not going to answer that.
It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously. You know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention. Hm? Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller. But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret. I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from Cars.
- Hi, you guys! - Daddy! Daddy! - Wow, I thought you guys would be sleeping. They wanted to wait up for you. Oh, well, I'm so happy to see you guys. How was your day?
It's negative, Jim. No visible signs of trauma. No bloating. Tongue and soft palate appear pale, almost white. Eyes are clear.
True. Did you mention we stole a horse? Yes. Good. You mustn't tell lies.
Miss Davidson, we know the rules are there for a reason. But it doesn't mean they're always right. Like the wet cells. You fixed that. Now, all the women are cut up about what happened to Debbie.
Play ball. Come on, Tate. Swing big! Read "Moneyball," asshole. Walks are as good as hits.
I did it! Close that door immediately! What's up? I was examining the osmia avoseta that Gerald Lydon gave me, and it got loose. Oh, so there's an almost-extinct bee flying around in here?
I had to do that. I wanted to be alone with her. We believe we found the "X," 'cause that was the only tree in the forest that was, like, crisscrossed. I looked down at the floor and I open up a hollow log, which, to me, a rifle could easily slide inside.
She trades everything else. It's not the same. Women do what they do. That's the hell of it. What?
Aren't we? Hey, man, that song... way better than those jingles you were writing the other day. You know how many songs I've written since I've been here? Two, and they both sucked. - No, they didn't.
- Oh, yeah. - It's just one door on the left from there. - But wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? You know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow? No.
Look at the water damage. It hasn't rained in days. Which means she had plenty of time to get up to Atlantic City and kill Anson and Nate. Damn! I can't believe I trusted her.
I didn't think even Jacs would go that far to use their kid to bring in drugs. Hold on. Jacs? Oh, yeah. She calls the shots and Ronnie does what she's told. It'll be Ronnie who cops it in the neck. There's women in here who don't tolerate kids being used.
Honestly, I just can't believe that you said yes the same day that we agreed Victor's our priority. Victor is our prior... wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, what... is that what this is about?
Some of them did. Well, they needed us. So the Wesen fought for the royals? Yes, and the royals needed the Grimms to control them, as they do now, but there was one thing in the treasure the knights hid. There was one thing that was more powerful than anything anyone had ever seen.
So we have to wait for them to fix the bug? Or for someone in the real world to remove the NerveGear from us. But I live alone. What about you? I have a mom and a sister.
Well, an opportunity has come up to turn that fantasy into reality. For those of you who care enough to join us. In two weeks, an untouched jungle in the Peruvian Amazon will be destroyed forever. And so will the natives inside it. The companies want the natural gas in the ground under the villages.
He's been here six days. So in case the first curse was broken, a fail-safe was built in by the person who cursed him. Trick. And only by the blood of your enemy can the curse be broken. Trick's blood is in me.
I replay arguments in my head all the time. We all do, right? Maybe she was still thinking about him when she was attacked. You're interfering with my marriage! Which is why she assigned David Jorgensen's features to a faceless stranger.
That's great. - Gone. - Happy? - I am happy. Awesome. Is that a shirt of your dad's? I guess I would have, you know, a senior moment.
- God! - Listen, I have a reputation. I know you don't care about that, but it means something to me. Anna. I'm sorry.
The thing is, Tommy made a series of rookie mistakes. I hardly noticed them at first, but when you add 'em all up, there's no way he could be a trained cop. I-I would... I would just like you to note that I told you so. I told you so!
So unless you are passing instructions to her old assets... She could've helped us from her cell, couldn't she? Given us the names, information we needed? Why bring her here? As per her request; obviously, part of the deal she just struck with your superiors.
What about five whales? If they were working together as a team? - As a gang. - As a gang. If they were coordinated? Five at once.
Your assistant probably sabotaged you. I don't even use one anymore. I resorted to using my own legs in the "Saw the Lady in Half" gag. I even shaved them. Want to feel?
Look... That big bitch got scared and decided to go home! No... Why? That's toward the center rear.
There were no witnesses, so the trail went cold, they never solved the case. It's "I know what you did last summer." "Who's the guiltiest of them all?" The killer thinks that one of these women is responsible for his death. Maybe they are.
Not until I have what I came for. You dare challenge me, the ancient Dochraid? You, a puny sorcerer! And yet I will have what I came for. I am a creature of the earth, you cannot kill me.
_ _ Déjame! Y'all might not hit a girl, but I will knock a bitch out. I'd like to say thank you to everyone in the community for your trust, okay?

All's not lost. We can have our own Christmas in July. Lovely, isn't it? Mine had seven little swans, just like the carol. Mrs Fowler must have laid out the rooms just before Len...
It's the in-betweens that are a problem. Right, exactly. Yeah, women under 18 and over 40 are the best at relationships, - 'cause the young ones... - True.
Ow! My knee cap! That's new. I like it. This dragon must have a weakness. Actually, no.
He's essentially walking them through the mating behavior of a captive praying mantis, only entirely on his terms. He even mirrors the decapitation of the insect by forcing them to eat pieces of a human head, only it's not a male human head, it's a female human head. The woman that's the core of his rage. Exactly. Now all women are his enemy.
It scared the hell out of a lot of people. They were afraid that WANK would cause a launch failure, where this nuclear battery was suddenly flying away from an exploding spacecraft. All systems are go. Eleven, ten, nine... McMAHON: How in the name of hell are we going to stop it?
All right, big... hold on, one thing! Let's arm wrestle. - You lost! - Oh! Olympia, a plain in Greece in the western Peloponnese.
- Say it. I'm your peer. You're my peer. - We're exactly the same. - We're exactly the same.
Thank you. You seen Calvin? One of these days, you're gonna run out of places to hide, mate. It's okay, I talked to them. You can wear your hoodie for the speech today.
You know that live nerves are better than dead ones. Even I know that, and I'm an intern. And you. You put me in a really awkward position today. You just threw me to the wolves. Not that I'm comparing your sisters to wolves. But oh, my god. They're out for blood. They are furious with you that you didn't call them yourself.
Yeah, well, me too. I'm not going to make it either. Doctor! I will leave in the escape capsule. Destroy where necessary. Escape capsule?
In this experiment, you'll be allowed to govern yourselves completely with no interference and no help. We will abandon you with a camera crew to document your adventure, but the world you know is gone-- slate wiped clean, and you will start a new civilization. - Are you ready to begin? - Yes. Okay. 2 miles due east... are the remains of a primitive settlement, an outpost where fur traders would stop to barter their wares. But one day in 1908, this settlement was found abandoned, fire still burning, food still cooking in pots, but its 14 inhabitants had mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again.
Dr. Gourse? You talked to Dr. Gourse? Yes. He said Lexy is too sick for this to work. This man's blood won't do anything.
Global warming, which influences the algal growth and as a result, algae can then produce toxic substances that are harmful to corals, and humans who break them when they are industrial fishing or even only diving on vacation. A coral typically takes hundreds of years to fully grow, which is why we should be careful whenever we pay them a visit. This will ensure that not only we, but the generations that come after us, can fully enjoy the wonderful play of colours and the exciting hustle and bustle that corals play host to. Encountering a ray is a terrific experience. Nothing compares to the graceful and weightless swimming of this marvellous fish.
That's where you're wrong, Billy. Here comes '50s dad. Awesome. Women like their men's bodies with a bit of character. Makes them feel good.
Let's see what this is about. "Silver rush... grubstakes..." Mikey, I don't mean to alarm you, but-- I know, I know. Eh? Two women died in the house.
Never mention your work. What should I talk about then? You start... You start with... a joke. A joke always works. It's a good way to relax women.
The dancer guy? - I don't know why I said that. - I don't either. Folks, we need you to look at some photographs, but I will warn you, they are a little bit graphic. Oh, heavens. I apologise.
Yes, I can. Maybe it won't be so bad now that he and Donna broke up. Thank God I don't have to see that anymore. Ugh. There are some things I can never un-see. I know we're never getting back together.
It heals. This is a new age. This is a new God. You're insane. And I won't help.
Who are you? My name is Aurora. I'm with your mom - and your grandmother. - Are they okay?
Hurry up. Wasn't sure when to bring this up, but maybe I could use a little warm-up this time. Warming up, like a jog around the block? 'Cause if you're asking Kev to go down on you, I can tell you right now that is not happening.

But what happens to its now damaged heart has never been seen in mammals before. We found that within three weeks, after cutting off the tip of the heart, that it all grew back normally, and the function was normal and the heart went back to pumping blood normally as if nothing had happened. Although the mouse is only capable of regenerating its damaged heart tissue like this, for the first seven days of its life, this is a discovery that could lead to harnessing this regenerative power for humans. What is the switch that turned on this process initially? How did you do that initially?

Oops, the propeller fell. That was over 8 seconds. You'll live long. I don't want to live a long life as an invalid. Not that kind of long life.
She's our killer. Wait, wait, wait. She's on a call. She can call back. Glen, this magazine is not about tweets or likes on facebook, For god's sake! For 57 years, Women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!
So what you can see here is the virus attaching to receptors in a healthy human cell. Once attached, it invades and completely destroys its host before moving on to the next cell. This is what happens to everyone in the world who contracts the virus. And death comes quickly... As you have seen.
Hey, buddy. How are you doing? Also, what are you doing? I ordered this victory cake, and now I'm throwing it away. Don't think you need to cut it up before you throw it out.
TV, the internet, parent/teacher conferences-- I ignore it. Embrace denial. You'll be much happier. Then, when you turn 21, embrace beer. [ Sighs ] Nice parenting there, dad.
Like you betrayed me at that last vote. - How dare you. - How dare I what? You were more than happy to help out when it served your purposes. I voted the way I did the second I realized it was all a lie.
How do I know there's not a gun to your head right now? Well, you don't have to trust me. Just watch. Now certain facts have recently come to light, like what really happened in Pakistan and to your boat. The truth is coming out.
She went back to Delhi. What do you think? Does Vasudha also think it's my fault? If I wouldn't have bought the monastery, someone else would have. Girls, I tell you.
I understand. But this level of surveillance comes with a lot of red tape. I'll cut through it. In the meantime, I need you on something else. A charter plane crashed in New Jersey this morning, killing everyone on board.
You don't. All you have is my word. Not good enough for me. I'll get you what you want. But only if you deliver the money personally.
Down off the Keys - where the marlin run. - Write your own Hemmingway story. And if you don't catch anything, you have to blow your brains out. So, Ross, where do you take your kid fishing?
Of course the law says that anyone caught aiding or abetting abortion shall be punished in like manner as the principal offender. Made a study of the law, have you? So should you, if this is to be your only livelihood after the hospital closes. And who says the hospital is closing? The smart money is moving uptown.
Using the astrolabe unleashes... an evil. A formidable evil, an evil that has to be eradicated. And the only way to do that is to undo what the astrolabe did? Yes, if the same person uses the astrolabe again, time will be reset. The evil never will have existed.
But one thing I can promise is that this gives you a little hope. Isn't that what you said about chemo? What we said about chemo was that it would buy you some time. Right. And what you told us was that you didn't want whatever time you had left ruined by what chemo does to your body.
- I worked there. One year away from becoming a Portfolio Manager and a seven-figure bonus when the meltdown happened and the firm blew up. But I learned two things from it. Hard work alone doesn't protect your downside and nobody plays for free. What do college campuses have in common with Las Vegas and Atlantic City?
"Why Grandma Keeps Tripping Over Her Boobs." Guys. Guys. Last night, I had a dream. Just like Dr. Martin Luther King. No. Way better.
He helped me get to the bottom of our little peeping Tom issue. Is that such a good idea? I trust him. And believe me, if he cared so much about the Charleston PD, he wouldn't have given me this. Now, Ed was able to extract a whole mess of video clips.
I want to fix this. I know. I know, but you can't. Okay, we've been chasing after what we used to have ever since you found out about Malcolm, but... I just don't... I don't think that we can ever get that back.
It's okay, he's... he's with The New York Times. They're... they're doing a story on us. We're not gonna be paying for those afterwards. Hi, me again. Where are the bathrooms?

It's going to be dark in an hour. I think I might go back to that village. Remember which way it was? Think it's this way. Where you going?
Can we be done with this now? Where'd you dump the carpeting that you pulled up that night? I thought you said you had it. No, I said we're gonna test it. Well, how can you test it if you don't have it?
The clue said it was right under my nose. It's right under my nose. Waste,our time,guys,unless you got anything up there,carter. Where the hell is the damn idol? Come on,man.
What do you want me to talk about then? An interesting exhibition, your work... Some entertainment. I visited the Monet exhibition in the Grand Palais. I saw a piece which threw me down yesterday.
If that is your Bo on that card, she's in a heap of trouble. Eddy, you have to help me. Apologies, but no. Are you hungry? I've a sudden craving for mutton.
What an entrance. I am such a proud papa. Looks like you won't be getting your lesbian after all. Yeah, we'll see. Can I just say something?
Everyone, I know that you're frightened and confused, but I need you to listen. Is it true? Is there... is there some kind of monster keeping us from leaving town? Is that what happened to my brothers? Yes.
Isolated seven pairs of shoe prints. Filtered out the Turner's including Jessie's, so we're down to three unsubs, sneakers are sizes seven three and a half, and a boy's eleven. The lost boy. I think I found one of them. Most of the time in sexual assaults, the bite mark has a livid spot at the center, a "suck bruise."
I can't tell you how sorry I am for your loss. If I can do anything, anything at all, please don't hesitate. Does it ever get hard dealing with all that tragedy? You know, it's funny. Some cases, they end well, so you can forget them.

By the divine in all, on the count of five, you will release her! The prophecy is coming true. And we have less time than I thought. That demon that was in you, it wants you. But not like before.
Okay, Batman. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone. Let me guess, you're keeping it pure, right? You want to make it about the art and not about the artist. Some things are easy to make fun of.
Did he mention her to you? No. We just talked business. Was he seeing anyone? Do you know who the woman could have been? No. Ron loved the ladies.
I'm not talking. I think you're looking at the death penalty. I'll never make it to the chair. I'm a correctional officer. I won't last a week in prison, but can I tell you a little secret?
It's like this Buddhist guy says. "You see this goblet? For me, it is already broken. I enjoy it. I drink out of it.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore. Go on. - What? - Well, okay, then. It was like earlier tonight, when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine." All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Being cool, doing cool things, and before you know it, you're part of their agenda. What? You know, you should read this book. It's called The End of Men. In it they talk about how, pretty soon, men are gonna become irrelevant.
What gets bigger the more you take away? A hole. - What gets wetter the more it dries? - A towel. When is a door not a door?
I'm going to stab it into the softest part of Ms. Ellison's thigh. Lots of nerve endings there-- no one can fake their way through that. If you wanted to know if she was really in a coma, all you had to do was ask. That's okay, but I can't stab her in the thigh? It's a test for pseudocoma.
Tell him what was going on with the sub. A few hours later, he killed Red. Deal was off. Would you have? Been a traitor?
It's Coach Mclntire. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2012 - Women's Gymnastics Trials. Please welcome our special guests, and fellow Olympians, the United States 2012 Men's Gymnastics Team, the US Women's Volleyball Team, the US BMX Cycling Team, the US Men's Wrestling Team, the US Men's and Women's Rifle Shooting Team, the US Men's Water Polo Team, the US Women's Swimming Team, and the reason we're here today, the candidates for the United States 2012 Women's Gymnastics Team. - - And would you look at that.
The printer's down. Again? They really need to replace that thing. I-is that how you solve all your problems? Uh, what if that old printer has only been here for two months and already increased ad sales by 15%?
I don't wanna do that. It's what you must do to guarantee your mother spends the rest of her days filled with love for what is in front of her. You said I should be specific, so I've been really thinking about this. Good. I want to have been married to her, Katie, the whole time.
How's she doing? Something very strange happened tonight. I followed her to the cafe, and I'm not quite sure what I saw, but I think she had some kind of pain. Because of the pregnancy? That's what it looked like, but it's what happened after.
Mr. Cross and his team dragged the creature through the forest to the anomaly. Yes, sir. It was an ornitholestes. They'd tranquilized it. Right, after which Mr. Cross asked you to have your men guard the anomaly.
Well, speaking of club history, my colleagues found some recent online photos of the Lockjaw Club's interior, to aid with reconstruction. Noticed something missing. Must've been a pretty sweet guitar to get that kind of treatment. You know who gave me that guitar? Stevie Ray Vaughan.
'Dealing with them Arabs.' Yo, Tom, I'd never disrespect you. 'Them Arabs lost their fingers! You give the kid your score. 'If it doesn't get to me by tonight, you'll go the same way they did.' They'll have the lot of you!

Such a strange thought... to see people again. It's just... pretty cool. (bird chirping) You can't shoot fish with a slingshot! So close, mom! It's clear you guys have a screw loose.
What is it? I got an e-mail. If you catch the sun just right, the bug catches fire. Why do you want to kill a bug? Because we can.
Thank you for agreeing to be our judges. Sergeant Perez and I have prepared meals using traditional Army ingredients. What I have for you today are braised chicken thighs in a white wine reduction with caramelized shallots. And I have prepared meat and potatoes. Oh. The potato has been prepared one-ways, baked.
- All right. - Right there. Ah! If you guys weren't neighbors, I'd put that chair on your bill, Bert. Fuck you, Hilly.
Finally, yes. - I'm so sorry about before. - It ain't your fault, Willa. Do you really think she burned herself on purpose? When the good Lord made us, Willa, he gave us reflexes for a reason.
- Mike doesn't know where it is. Only I do. And you're dealing with me now, not him. Why don't you just cut to what it is you want, or what you think is gonna happen here, all right? 'Cause we're gonna get what we came for.
My choice just became... Much easier. All right, they kept the girls in a dorm Somewhere in this area, But now that lynch doesn't need them anymore... Wh-What do you mean, doesn't need them? They're just guinea pigs, lab rats. The seed--It's...
I shouldn't just wait for them to find it themselves? First week of rehearsal? Sure. Week before tech? Get in there.
How we made towers to work the weather. But the truth is... one day... it started to snow. And it never stopped. Hey! Is that what I think it is? Weather modification. Never seen one this close.
How you gonna explain that to him? Well, that's more your concern. Well, perhaps it'll jog his memory. Or give him nightmares. Last time, this curse took away everyone's memories.
Absolutely. Are you sure? Yes, sir. With all that said, the whole thing relies on us replacing the weight of methylamine we steal with the same weight in water. So they'll never know we hit them. Cool.
Isn't it obvious? - No. - Well, then, you're an idiot. And I'm not gonna take the time to explain it. Well, just spoke to Eden. Turns out she was not faking it.
I mean, that's more than half, and I got nothing- - Nothing. Axl, you're only 17. Nobody expects an Earth-shattering story. Just think of something that was meaningful to you and write about that.
If she bypasses the gang and cooperates with us, she'd be the next victim. Maybe she got those bruises from Delcampo. Maybe she's the one who killed him. No, men call the shots in a gang. Women tend to facilitate the murders;
- It says C6. And you know why? Because, eventually, when my building is complete, it will be 55 floors high. It will weigh 2,223,000 metric tons. Okay? My building will alter the water table and squeeze granite. It will be visible from 20 miles away.
Walter is a fine man, and wise with it. That's such a boon in these terrible times. Lena... I'm all set to emigrate. - What's put that in your head?
He came up with a much better solution. He said that he would create a website. In order to access the website, I would need a password. So he took a paper napkin that was on the table in this café where we were talking in Brussels and he hooked together several of the words in the commercial logo and wrote, "No capital letters. " I stuffed it in my pocket.
Oh, my god. That was so dull. It was... boring. You did... you did warn me, but, I mean... that joke... what was that joke? The proctologist and the flowers.
Faster, Percy! Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. Did I say that out loud? Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess.
Boom. So what else do you need? Well, nobody's questioning your ability, but you're hiding something. Look, we ran into some issues on our last job. We were hired to hit a network.
Okay, now jump. I think we're almost there. Thank God. This cave is the worst. I know, I don't know what's more offensive... the actual racism or the insulting notion that it might somehow rub off on us. Jive turkeys!
Okay. This is a process. We can look for other candidates at group tonight. We are gonna find you a sponsor before my stint is up, okay? Ha. Captain.
Your Dark Passenger. Where did you come up with that, anyway? I thought I got it from you. I gave you the code. The Dark Passenger was all yours.
I just don't want those charred bones I saw to be disappointed in me! I... I know what I have to do now! And this is the job we chose. Help me! Put on your hood. As far forward as you can... So that your face is hidden from it.
You want to start a war or do you want to give me what I came for and keep all this cash? Charlotte! - What is this? - I don't know. I just made the deal.
However, were the occasion an anniversary, then I must direct you to our most glittering gift. Though expensive, our engraved silver purses would make any birthday an occasion to treasure. Now... Shall we leave you a moment or two to muse, or are you ready to decide? None of us expected this to happen, but perhaps we should all admit it's for the best, hmm? I cherish reason.
Let's bag it and run the DNA. We're ready to give the profile. We believe that this unknown subject is a white male in his early 30s. Initially he targeted white, blond women in their 20s but is expanding his victim pool. His M.O. is to rape his victims and then shoot them in the heart.
Together, we could do what neither of us could do alone -- overthrow our oppressors. It's an interesting story. I can see why my son likes it. He always went in for fairy tales. But the problem is I've watched your kind.
I'm in no fit state to see visitors. My niece, Hattie Sutton, is missing, and I'm organising a search. If you don't want to be part of it because of Carroll's Field, then I totally understand, but no-one knows the woods like you. You want to search the woods? We're going to be knocking on doors, checking on outbuildings and barns first.
And my son, how is it? His injury is slight. I left company and the prefect of police. And? Reputation ripou Delgado made our credible version.
What kind of mood was she in? I mean, she looked worried or something? No, she was... just Anne-Marie, you know? A little awkward, a lot efficient. Her information on the trafficked women was very good.
When Valkyries are reborn, their memories come back slow and scattered. And apparently their hair full and lustrous. At this age, they're vulnerable and valuable. But her memories, they will come back eventually right? Valkyries deal in the souls of the dead.
No, you were not! You were not upstairs. If you were upstairs, you would have come down, and you would have helped me. So where were you? I snuck out of my room and went to a party.
Aster Corps? They're funding a program for Jake's board and care center, right? They took Jake's social worker off his case, a girl name Clea Hopkins. Jake really bonded with her. Her testimony's going to be vital to maintain the custody.
Our grandfather would fix that. He was always cooking up a plan in that brilliant mind of his. All right, pops, you said you had a plan. Whatcha thinkin'? Pops, you okay?


Put him in the limo and come get us. We'll meet you at valet. That was some ride, pal? Yeah, it was pretty wild. I can't feel my nuts.


You were right about before, okay? I was being self-centered, and I shouldn't have made the assumption I did, but there are certain things that you don't understand, either. Yeah, well, maybe that's for the best, Daniel. Do you wanna hear the truth or not? Emily lied about the pregnancy.
I'm stopping you. I'm not really sure how you'll do that. I'm a lawyer; watch me. Lindsey... Megan... and Pamela.
Even after the wash, her palm was covered in the stuff. And when she struggled with you, she got it all over your clothes. Captain, if you will? Exhibit B. Your Zegna shirt, raided from your closet earlier today, under a warrant.
Yeah. She's being looked after. You've seen her, have you? I just want to know if she's all right. The wet cells aren't built for comfort, Doreen. Oh, Miss Davidson, I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah. Um, "Be careful to avoid extravagant purchases this month." Well, I think I can manage that one. Well, then I'll count the pistol you gave me as being part of last month. I'll check in with you when I'm back in Washington.
I left him, Roy. I came to my senses. And you were right... a-about him, I mean, everything you said. Do the girls know? Not yet, but I will tell them.
Now can we get out of here before we're crushed to a pulp? I can't see, did we get him? This haunted masterpiece I've created is unstoppable. I truly am a genius. Just melt it down.
You didn't find anything in my room, did you? Just tell me what you know about the riot. Which one of you guys killed my wife? What makes you think it was one of us? How are the women doing after this morning?
I don't know who's behind it, and I don't want to. My girls... they have good life. They make good money. Legal money. They get nice clothes, apartment.
Yeah. Aren't we? Hey, man, that song... way better than those jingles you were writing the other day. You know how many songs I've written since I've been here? Two, and they both sucked.
Right, exactly. Yeah, women under 18 and over 40 are the best at relationships, - 'cause the young ones... - True. ...they can still maintain enough insecurity to be vulnerable, which is attractive.
He'll be out in 10 years. Unlike solo vigilantes, they're working in concert and they're planning and executing coordinated attacks. Their mentality is like a lynch mob. They believe the justice system has gone wrong and it's up to them to set it right. Due to the pre-planning and level of commitment, we believe our unsubs are over 30.
Ooh. I have the, uh, rental van on traffic cam footage from yesterday an hour after the shooting, turning east on Saticoy, 1400 block. That's about half a mile from the restaurant. Checking the first Saticoy cam and one on another street due west. If the van came out, it would have had to pass by one of them.
Aunt Sofia. I didn't even know she was in, in America. Oh, so you've been out of touch? And do you know this man? This man killed my mother.
It should be built somewhere where the 9/11 families don't have to feel the agony of having a shrine to their loved ones stomped upon. All over America we're seeing the influence of creeping Islam. We are? What about those who would impose Sharia law? Women can be stoned to death for committing adultery.
Oh, okay. So I can't be funny. Well. I understand you've been to Austin. Who told you that? The radio.
He must have stashed him elsewhere. I feel sick. Welcome to the family, love. You should have run the second your realized elijah was gone. Yeah. Well, the witches have put Some sort of hex on me. As long as I'm carrying this baby, I can't leave new orleans.
You are a perceptive prince, aren't you? Where are you going? Listen, mate, the Enchanted Forest is your home. Mine is the Jolly Roger. Hook, you don't even know if it's...
T.K., I actually brought you here to talk to you. How do I say this? Oh, my God! Rex Evans and Terrence King. [ Laughs ]
In the past three months, two women in their late 20s were killed. Both of these women were strangled, their bodies both found in a dense wooded area. However, we were unable to find any other evidence which connected these two women. Until we found this. Both of these women had profiles
A word forever casting shadow. You burn brightly enough to light darkest night. I voice concern and you offer flattery. I offer truth. Your fire blazes to rival the fucking sun.
Empty. He could be anywhere. The Sergeant mentioned the area is full of abandoned mine shafts. Look at this. Clem Ford said that he left Warong at 2pm on the day that Oskar died.
We burn sulphur sticks to sterilise the vats. Is that what Oskar was doing? Cleaning the vat? Well, if he was, he wasn't doing it right. You burn the stick over a bowl so it won't stick to the vat.
Zim Zallah Bim! Excellent work, everyone. Now we're ready in case anyone wants to speak with the Wizard. Now, remember... Oscar Diggs died, so that the Wizard of Oz could live.
Millie? Lipstick. Lucy, can you mark them up? Each journey, please. Now, we're not looking at the lines.
I hear the ticking of the clock. You've got me worked out? Yes, I have. Do you know how far you are from drinking again? This far.
Stop... please. The Pyrripus. You've heard of The Pyrripus? We ran into these warrior nuns. Lots of white, even more crazy.
Do you not have your own flat and your own job? Odenigbo has done what all men do and inserted his penis in the first hole he could find when you were away. Does that mean somebody died? When your uncle first married me, I worried because I thought all those women outside were coming to displace me from my home. I now know that nothing he would ever do would make my life change.
First and foremost, the mayor is fine and in control. I've just been in touch with him. But what I'm about to tell you is not to leave this room and, for reasons of security, is not what the public has been or will be told. So please, respect the sensitivity. Late last night, before this morning's troubles began, the mayor was summoned to Washington by the FBI regarding matters linked to the attempt made on his life and mine.
No, Luke, it's just me in Yvonne's jacket. And that scent you picked up on? That is the sweet smell of success. That jacket doesn't fit you. And I mean that figuratively.
The hex on him is getting worse by the day. My brother has a mystical torture device buried in his chest, and the mother of his child is inexplicably missing. So, I can assure you, I have no time to play any games, either. What do you need me to do? The dagger the witch gave me is inside of him?
Lincoln, do you copy? Hello? Peter, it's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Turn on the lights. The creature is nocturnal.
So what, he jumped out of a plane? Why? Maybe because it was going down. You're right, Danny. Yesterday, a small plane ashed in the jungle out five miles west of you.
Life makes you pay dearly, lt's such a raw deal It's a long, bumpy truck ride, And there's never a free meal Even these breaths we borrow will escape us tomorrow. We seek a home, around every bend,
I'll leave my window unlocked. What? Nothing. Look, I'm not a douche bag, all right? I'm always clear about my ground rules.
You know, she was the last person to see Merchiston alive. We need to find her. So, Mr. Merchiston, you go from rock journalist to quixotic muckraker. I'd have to say I'm just a seeker of the truth.
Who, A, have the impact of reaching millions of people instantly and also have natural political connections in their own jurisdictions. So we were trying to give him a kind of political immunity so that he could do this clearly provocative and somewhat dangerous thing in relative safety and with an assurance of success. Recognizing that WikiLeaks could benefit from a louder megaphone, Julian agreed to Nick's proposal. So, how am I going to get the documents back to London?
Riot units, armed with batons and tear gas, have been unable to quell what appears to be a full-scale riot. Many Chicagoans are afraid to step outside their front doors, and those who do are likely... Here we go again. - Meredith? - Hello, Mac.
- No. - May I come in? - Who are you? You're insane! Don't forget, these women hate themselves.
Hit him. Come on, darling. Do you remember the story I used to tell you of the Emperor Moth? Just a little thing. A naturalist once came upon the cocoon of this rare creature, just as it was struggling to emerge in its new form.
I could've gotten out any time I wanted. All I had to do was to agree to go back to Italy. But I stayed so I could be with you. So if you want to shut me out, it's fine. But you can never say that I haven't tried.
Listen to me my mother. The families and masons who formerly lived in this house appeared in the future. They now live in a time where they don't belong. It is enough Leopoldo. You must listen to me!
She loves the Grand Canyon, but for me, this... This is stunning. Great and audacious, humbling in its ambition and heart. You are that symbol. After the events of Pakistan and your actions against Indian imperialism, to the many who question where the heart of America lies, it's felt.
What if she knocked it on the way to the pool? A suicidal woman carefully replaces a damaged pot before lowering herself silently into the water? No. The tea. The tea has to hold the key.
What are you doing? This... You know, this is not Gumma Eve. This is not my wife? Oh.
It looks bad that you went to Professor Robinson's apartment at night. He told me to. The form to make him my new advisor was due the next day. Unfortunately, that conversation was a face-to-face with no witnesses, so we got no way to prove it, and when you texted him to confirm the meeting, he told you not to come. It looks like you ran a red light. My phone ran out of juice, and I never got his text.
Baby, last time... I was a drunk. And you were right not to trust me. But, Dad... I need you to trust me now.
You're right, should not be open. Ask Zaid. - Yes, let's ask him. One day, I heard: " The money from adultery is illegal."
Dummy, I didn't know you were working out. Rose is one of my closest friends. She's always there for me. She's always looking out for my best interest, and when I'm going through things, she always has my back. I think that people think bisexuals are slutty, you know what I mean?
- ( dog barks ) - Jesus. How's that going with you and Shoshanna? Good. Really good. Really good.
Walter, Walter... What have I done? Go now, please, please. Go now. Has someone called for the police?

Uh-huh. And just how do you expect me to explain picking up a margarita machine to Cat on the way to her apartment on her birthday, which supposedly you promised not to throw a party for? Good point. It's a match-- DNA of the hair and blood from a woman mid-to-late 20s. Sounds like Amy. What about the prints from the newspaper?
Yes. And an egg, but only once a week. How's that? Good. Where did these plates come from?
I gotta go let Agent Harris know. So she's safe. She's here somewhere, right? She's gotta be around here somewhere? She was.
But they're close. - How do you know? Because if they have the C.O., they're gonna call, try to make a trade... Tex and the C.O. for Dr. Scott and her work. So what you can see here is the virus attaching to receptors in a healthy human cell.
So the sooner we can get him back to the ship... He is not gonna make it back to the ship, at least not alive. The poison in his veins is gonna kill him soon, and I am the only one with the antidote. So... you can let us give your man the help he needs, or you can continue with your, uh... Impotent threats. You decide.
Local PD is rounding up the Turks. The marshal got his man. We got our thingy. I'd say, all in all, it's a pretty good day. I talked to Artie.
The harder you push or pull on something, the faster it goes. The Sun's gravity weakens with increasing distance, so, the planets that are farther from the Sun move more slowly. Everyone expected that the outermost stars in a galaxy would act the same way. Most of the stars are concentrated towards the center, so, their collective gravity pulls on the other stars the same way the Sun pulls on the planets. But in the 1970s, when astronomer Vera Rubin studied the Andromeda Galaxy, she discovered that the outer stars obeyed no such rule.

The test showed... that 17-year-old Naoko was pregnant from repeated rape. You'll be fine, Miss Masaki. It's not your fault. None of this is your fault. You've got nothing to worry about.
Nate. I'm so sorry. I-I-I promise you that. Find anything? Yeah, yeah.
Now, collars, please. Did you see that, Doris? Her skirts are around her ankles. That motor van you're loading... I don't see the Selfridges livery on the side.
Ever heard any? - No. - A story for every day of the year, most of them not fit to be repeated. None of them even close to the truth. Why don't you put them right?
It's awful about Bea. I can't imagine how she feels. She should have thought about her kid before she ended up in here. Last night, your husband found Debbie in her bedroom unconscious. Now the ambulance came and they tried everything they could but I'm sorry Bea, they were too late.
You're not going to experience this death of yours. He will. I'll be dead. (sighs) What about the pain?
Come on. We have to call the cavalry. The woman. Lynch. Where is she?
Aye, XO. What's in 'em? Three lives. So you just left civilization and never looked back? Yeah.
But I will do it again if I have to. We need an answer now, Dr. Hunt. Will you perform the surgery or not? Yeah, I'll do it. All right, fellas.
Thank you, Vod. Thank you so much. I would also like to make a speech. Um, as many of you will have just realised, I am about to become a laughing stock. My academic career is in tatters.

He was posing as a janitor. Yeah, uh, Carl, hasn't been around that long. Because until three months ago, he worked as an electrical engineer at an aerospace firm. With a pedigree like that, he would have the skills to design these sophisticated attacks. He must be staying somewhere in the city.
I'm sorry? Am I speaking Indo? I don't want your money. Meaning? Meaning that... when you come and see me,
Muster up your courage this once. After coming home... pay all your debt. Style a little bit.... The peoples here.... How many families...
You can only vote within your race or your group. Look, just pretend it's the 1950s. It makes it easier to understand. See, everyone elects a representative from their own tribe. White, black, Hispanic, golden girls, others.
This is why we must do this now. What about Chasseur? Oh, don't worry, darling. I've taken care of that as well. She won't be bothering you or your friend any longer.
Well, got what we came for. No. Vámonos. Brandy? Thank you, no. You know, besides finding those cages, my men also found your radio.
East-facing window like he likes. It's also private. Good. Okay. We've arrived! Hi. Dr. Bailey! How does the liver look?
Yeah, that's... Real admirable. You know what? I'm gonna run that 5k, and when I win, I'll be celebrating in my poolside cabana with a big ol' Denver omelet to keep me company. A Denver omelet might actually be better company.
An orange? Work camp in Dakota. A fella give me one. It was like eating a color in juice form. A fruit right out of Eden itself. Inside, it's already sectioned up.
This whole thing has got me seeing stuff, wondering. And you're my best mate. But this... It's nothing. The women, they...
She knew only the man you used to be. I'll onto this for another day. But I think we're done for now. You don't have to ask me twice. The only reason you're still alive is the list. That's why they'll never find it.
That was like a game of "rock, paper, pervert." Sophie, thank you for coming in. Max and I wanted to talk to you about taking you up on your offer to work for your cleaning company. Yeah, she wants to do it for money to pay for our website, and I want to do it because I like rummaging through strangers' medicine cabinets. Have you cleaned houses before?
911. What is your emergency? Would you like me to send an ambulance to your location? An explosion. Are you sure?
How's your night? Yeah, pretty... Pretty shit. Just found out me best mate's been having sex with... probably the only girl I've ever really loved. Women don't know what they do to us.
Uh, a Tequila brand amb... ambassador thing? What the hell's that? Something dumb. Okay... He's the face of the brand.
So peaceful. Wake up! We got one more! Now, if this don't get you to sleep, nothing will. "Cinderella" by nobody remembers.
- What kind of Fae can do that? - A Liderc. Trickster Fae capable of impregnating a host without detection. The oblivious mother finds herself delivering his baby mere days later. Then we wipe the mothers' memories, convince them they've re-offended out in the world...
they're not my style. Oh, of course! Damn right. Madam, if I may... Real whips are nothing like that.
How's the food here? Yeah, apparently, it's good. No burgers. I wish my wife were here. Women really love this kind of stuff.
There's no defensive wounds. Her larynx was completely crushed. Hey, Rossi, take a look at her fingernails. For a woman who lives on the streets, she appears well-groomed. Yeah, it was the same with both victims.
It's hard to believe we work right up there, and this is the first time we've met, right? This is my brother, business partner, best friend, and tennis coach, Duncan. Hi. Hi. What kind of plant you got there, buddy? Checking.
Wait, Dash, look, I love you. Please, just... This was a big mis... I can't even look at you right now. This will end if you tell me where the snake is. It's gone.
- No! Look, good luck with it all, Christine, but singing's not for me. ♪ Me, me, me, me, me... ♪ - I-I-I-I... Honestly, I've no idea. - Oh, come on.
No sign of the $50,605. A luxury condo and that much money-- what does this girl do for a living? She worked for a real estate firm as a high-end broker. If you didn't have $10 mil to plunk down on an apartment, she wasn't your girl. Okay, so we got three women, all in their 20s, all successful, all have a secret meeting last Friday and then pull the exact same amount of cash out of the bank.
Got something for me? Oh. So, here's the thing. No. Maybe you'd care to explain. Not everyone had stamps. They didn't know you was gonna be looking for 'em.
I just couldn't lose you, not like that. I made Klaus give you his blood. I see. So the devil has a deal for me, after all. Uncle Kieran...
I found out who sent that email to Elena Ramos. Someone named Rebecca Sutter. You think it's coincidental that Cliff Barnes suddenly shows up in Dallas just when Southfork is for sale? Are you sure you want to mix business with pleasure? My father has cancer.
I promise you, you'll never have to fire them. Sometimes... when all your enemy knows is killing... a simple deception can suffice. Riario is far more clever than you think, da Vinci. Your wit won't get us out of this one. Only your weapons will.
Why has Kate got ﬂowers? She's allergic. - Only mildly. Ah, Michaela! I've come to take my car.
Ah, it's just some stuff I put on 'em 'cause they're always cracking and bleeding. Invi-Skin. Yeah, that's it. Thanks. The department mechanic checked out Bowden's car.
The blood that has been spilled, my blood yet, was because of what you foresaw. It's not a science, it's a gift. Sometimes I hear voices, other times it's a feeling, a certainty as solid as stone. And this new feeling? It came to me today.
She's pretty. Y'all were trespassing! I'm with the FBI, okay? I announced myself. We just had a little harmless gunplay. Harmless?
And dermal infection and conjunctivitis are both symptoms, which is why they looked possessed. I will check it out. Nicely done. Surprised? No. Pleased.
- Who likes quiche, - long walks on the beach, smooth jazz. - I thought you wanted to meet someone. - I meet plenty of women. I don't need your help.
the day I caught that cachamoa fish. and we took right home and fried it up? We got home and you ate it all yourself. You left me nothing but the head. You left me nothing but the head. I found this talisman where l get my drugs.
- Huck, stop. We are in my wheelhouse now. Okay, B-613 was a top-secret, off-the books program funded by the C.I.A. I'm supposed to be a ghost. If my name... and not my real name, but Huck, my name, the alias that goes with this life at Pope and Associates...
-His mother's still alive. -Beatrice should not be here! I will restart you in 12 hours. I did not find the battery. The model is no longer manufactured.
And did one of your men tell you there was someone still inside? Yes, he did, and he wanted to go back in and get him. I said no. Seconds later, there was a flashover. I wouldn't ask you these questions unless I had to, chief.
- Would you mind getting that, please? - Got it. - Thank you. - Thanks. Well... You're gonna have to deliver that album. Listen, I'll just keep trying Liam. And you know what?
Please don't tell anyone. This is it. Thank you for walking me home. I could have walked with you forever. Why have I never met you before?
I don't wash my hands before surgery. I can see why women find Clive Owen attractive to the point where I might just as well be attracted to him. I use comparisons to Hitler to win arguments on the Internet at the drop of a hat. I know nothing about wine. I'm more turned on by women in pajamas than lingerie.
Adelaide and I, we know what loss looks like. We're going to find your daughter, Nate. Now. He has to have a place near the police station. Right?
The director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, found a new and, to his mind, potentially dangerous group... the women's liberation movement. Hoover sent the following directive, quote... "It is absolutely essential that we conduct sufficient investigation of the women's liberation movement to determine any possible threat they may represent to the security of the United States." End quote. J. Edgar Hoover said women couldn't be agents. So the FBI got women who were informants. These informants were sitting in on women's consciousness-raising groups, writing stories back to their agents saying,
You go ahead. I think I should find west in case he has any questions about Harvard. Oh, now that you mention it, I have a question about Harvard. What do you think... Your chances are?
Giddyup! What are you doing here? You're supposed to be staying at Debbie's. We had a fight. She painted my purple room green.
Until the last moment. You have to sign the contract now if you don't mind. The toaster is broken. How am I going to make foie gras? I can fix it.
An alloy with silver is preferable for proper conductivity and corrosion. You were gonna let us use the wrong wire? I never would have let you get that far without me. You roughen it to increase the conductivity? Seems to double the effectiveness.
Yeah, you're hot. you got a great face, and everybody knows that. You got, uh, legs of steel. I do live in a fifth-floor walkup. Well, it's working good, and your whole...
Ridiculous. I am the knowledge and strength of 10,000 worlds. I am flesh and machine. I am becoming everything. And you, your arrival is no more than a rare opportunity for entertainment.
I can't go on with this." That's what he said. I wouldn't be surprised if you killed him rather than let him come back to me. It is not true. Mrs Paynter. Monsieur, surely you cannot believe...
- Mine just bloomed yesterday. - Congratulations. Ooh, there she is. Monday night, one biology room key checked out by... Magnitude.
I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy? Better than you think. You know, if you ask nicely, they'll let you visit the engine room. I never want this day to end.
It's belladonna, the devil's cherry. I know it from working narcotics. Belladonna's highly toxic. That's why users dilute it with tea. The berries have a sweet flavor. They say it gives you instant hallucinations.
In 1927, Chaney made 'London After Midnight', a horror film with the director Tod Browning. It was said that if you saw the film it could drive you insane, and certainly no known copies of the film exist anymore, perhaps because they were all destroyed. Mantus claimed that he had the only surviving reels of the film. - Is that true? - I really don't know.
Remember? The story of Alzheimer's is never about one person. My PhD thesis film posits that this insidious disease not only destroys the patient, but has a physiological influence on the primary caregiver. Alzheimer's occurs when abnormal protein fragments accumulate in the hippocampus, killing neurons. The disease then creeps towards the front of the brain, wiping out neurons responsible for logical thought and problem solving. It then assaults the sensory region, sparking terrifying hallucinations.
So you hate it? Much of what I do does not make me cry. But the job's only temporary. Marshall was offered the judgeship once, and he turned it down for me. So, karmically, that phone has to ring again.
This Dinner for Free Speech was in fact dinner for Julian's sex offense defense fund. No one knows now whether money given to WikiLeaks is going to Julian or elsewhere. Julian's legal troubles made him more famous than ever, but they also intensified his differences with his former media partners. They defended his right to publish but began to turn on Assange himself. I've been close enough to see the wasps around the jam here.
I would see those days return. I would relight the great forges of the Dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the Halls of Erebor! Death! That is what you will bring upon us! Dragon fire and ruin.
A hook. Hey. Come with me. This... Powder made from poppies. He has to inhale it.

He's not here. Any chance another maid cleaned this room? Not today. This is my floor. You notice anything out of the ordinary?
So, I went and saw my mother. She's being sued by a dance mom. Honestly, I'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. I mean, she made me cry in class a lot. Disney princesses made you cry.
Because I feel like Lloyd was giving me a weird look in the break room. Lazy-eyed Lloyd? That's the only look he's got. Am I right? Yeah, this place is amazing.
The murder itself was planned in detail and then carried out. Only two kinds of murderers follow that pattern. Hired assassins and those out for revenge. Mr Segers was not working for someone else. So Mr Segers was out for revenge.
- What about? - I'll explain later. Sign, please. Sign, if you don't mind. When we get to Mexico, we're going to report the Peninsula Company and all of you... including the stewardesses in Economy Class!
Just because I'm not dealing with this in the way that you want me to... You're not dealing with this at all, Jo. And you lied to the girls last night, telling them that you banished the shape-shifter. That's not possible. You don't know who it is.
I did what I wanted and it was The How Mountain. Holy Mountain really is an extraordinary film. It feels like a work of art that's come from a parallel world. A totally different version of the film industry where there really are no limits. I gave the movie to Michel Seydoux in France.
I won't have you suspended... Without pay. Oh, that sounds great. Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.
She's a tennis player. Took two shots to the chest. Casings recovered, a nine mil. - What are we picking up? - Little diamonds.
Oh, my God! It only happens twice. Hey. Can I talk to you in the storeroom? I can't, um, find the olives.
I assume he meant a turkey. I hope he doesn't bring everyone down. Last Thanksgiving, he had just broken up with Lauren, and he was a real bummer. I love these potatoes. Yeah?
Vic has stitches. Hello? I'm standing outside Huxley station right now -- Shut up. I'm thinking.

Quiet. Old school? Hey, guys. Why would we close the l-7? Just following orders.
- That's not fair, Ms. De Beaufort. Were the circumstances of our meeting different I think you and I could've been friends. I can see it. What size shoe do you wear? Could have been friends.
You never wore a bomb? But you did make a suicide tape. Who did you give it to? I didn't give it to anyone. I threw it in the trash.
- Sounds unpleasant. Just watch where you step. We're at the carport. The northwest overhang. You see the camera?
You said it yourself. Why are you now defending him? Because what he says makes sense. Freddy Ashmead was a dying man. The only reason to hasten his death would be to stop his quest for the truth.
Even so, let me give you a fresh one. We can't risk you getting thirsty. Ah! Oh, I am so sorry. I just bought this tux.
Bucky Sharavino. He was a chocolatier. My boss rented this mansion from Bucky's estate. Legend has it that Bucky built his own secret chocolate room. Does legend say where this room is exactly?
Nigel! Nigel! You bitches are the reason I do this. I love you all. We won UK Prisons Tug of War, we won Best Float at the Lord Mayor's Show, and we then we took a gold at the Prison Vegetable Awards for the fourth year running.
Now, come at me. Right here. As hard as you can. Their legs go like runny shit! Then here, see?
Witches aren't allowed to do magic here. She broke the rules. I told you I wanted to talk to her. Hey, I'm sorry. I got caught up in the show.
He deserves a trial, Dan. Two Rangers are dead. Didn't get no trial. Well, I'm coming with you. The law looks a lot different on the ground, little brother.
That's analog. It's how it sounds. Especially Neve's, you know. I mean, everything is just better. The human voice sounds better.
What? Please do come and look. Excusez-moi. What? Tell me. Is it likely they'll survive? Two women, unfit, without protective clothing, without skis. In the freezing dark.
"Subject reported patient Cavanaugh "was not in her room at bed check. "He discovered the roof access door unlocked. "He went up to the roof and looked over the east ledge and saw a body on the ground below." That's what Wilden wrote in his notes. Yeah, that's what I told him.
Special effects are kind of my hobby. It's pretty amazing, actually, what you can do with, like, some fishing wire and magnets. And people are pretty gullible. Now, when I saw those girls being so mean to Jordan, I just... I just wanted to make them stop.
So vote for Andie. I don't know if you noticed, but I bought out the whole restaurant. What do you think? Best boyfriend ever? (Chuckles) I also got flowers.
I mean, familiar with the products. Damn it. I've got to stop using the no-no words. Lacey, we have two rules here. One, if you're going to be late, you have to call.
"So also was Lot among those sent by us. "Behold, we delivered him and his adherents, "all except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind. "Then we destroyed the rest. "Truly, you pass by their sites by day and by night."
We can leave behind Klaus and this city and those orphan Annie vampires. Whoa, those orphan Annie vampires are my family, and this city is my home. It was my home, too, once. I left. You ran. I stayed.
I made nutritious meals for my kids from the time that they were very little, and I really don't think it made much of a difference at all. Hi. You're back soon. Yeah, well, you know, I had to bring you this '09 Syrah from Napa. Okay.
We're having a dance. How's your night? Yeah, pretty... Pretty shit. Just found out me best mate's been having sex with... probably the only girl I've ever really loved.
And like the Roman emperors, he has built a house of God in Jerusalem. But Abd al-Malik, Lord of Jerusalem though he is, is also an Arab. Perhaps for Arabs, Jerusalem, for all its ancient and unrivalled potency, owed too much to the Jews and Christians to stand alone as the holy city of the new Arab empire. A poet at Abd al-Malik's court describes him as the Lord of two houses, sacred to God. One in Jerusalem, and one, well, he doesn't say where it is.
Yeah, complete with e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and post office boxes. It's like these criminals built themselves an extra space inside these people's lives, with their own separate lines of communication, which we can now use to smoke them out. So what are you thinking, captain? I'm thinking that we take these credit reports and we send a message to each one of these criminal e-mail accounts with a warning about potential identity fraud. The thieves might try to move all the cash they collected at once.
I am a woman, and therefore a lesbian. We talk in different tones. We don't all agree. We have the right to define our own differences. Now I would like to ask Germaine Greer... I really don't know what women are asking for. Now, suppose I wanted to give it to them.
So you have no intention of changing your policy of segregated facilities. Is that correct, sir? There's a sign out there now. Come on. Let's go. - Do you discriminate by sex? - Come on. Let's get out of here.
That I don't hear them screaming every time I close my eyes? It would be so much simpler if I was just one thing, wouldn't it? The mad scientist who made that killing machine, or the physician who has dedicated his life to serving this town. The fact that I'm both... bewilders you. Oh, I know exactly what you are.
Like leaning over a 300-pound microwaved burrito. Thirsty. Yeah, yeah, sit up a little. Don't drink too much, 'cause I'm not gonna give you a piggyback ride to the can. I love bendy straws. Yeah, women have to complicate everything.

It's high. I would need to do a number of vocal exercises before I attempted that. I think the lyrics so much sum up the recording business. Rock 'n' roll, man. # You're gonna go far. # The record companies were...
See, it's this reversal that's likely causing the face blindness. But, as the swelling in your brain goes down, your facial recognition should return. Hopefully within a few weeks. Is that how long I'll have to rest? The opposite, actually.
But Steven, it'll never get made with all the hardcore gay sex. That's why we're gonna cut those scenes out and deliver the clean script to Hollywood. Then this movie will definitely get made. Let's do it! Yeah!
Engines are shut down. No lights. Whoa, it's cold. It's like a dead animal. There's something really wrong here.
Because when Lord Carnarvon opened Tutankhamun's tomb back... whenever the hell that was, four months later, he died from a mosquito bite. And what did it say above that tomb? "Death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the king." Well... Our study did not have a tomb or a king.
I ain't been to med school, or fairy school or nothing. So if you can put it in terms a "laid man" can understand, I'd appreciate it. I'm going to send my light through her and if the fae in her is strong, my light will pass through her body unhindered. Well, send it on through. What- is that bad? 'Cause-
Yeah! Who are you? My name is Aurora. I'm with your mom - and your grandmother.
Jafar has the heart. There's no stopping him now. I'm not so sure about that. Tell me what you see. The needle... it's following you.
I know that you left the bar last night with another woman. Doc, I was in a really dark place night. And I did leave the bar with someone. I walked a girl out to her car, all right. Her battery was dead, she said she needed a jump, and, yeah, you know, something could have happened.
Travels through the nervous system. Is that why the incubation times vary so wildly? Exactly. Anywhere from a few days to several years. Depends on how close to the brain the bite is and how fast the infection travels through the neurons.
Why do we only learn this now? The manager doesn't answer the phone after 22 o'clock. And we only realized this morning that he's open during the winter. - So what does he say? - Sarah.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. You know [Chuckles] I told Mellie there was no way...
I've seen stretched earlobes, forked tongues, steel plates implanted under the skin. Amputation is the next frontier. So maybe for Nina, the tattoo and the piercings was like a gateway drug, and whoever did this to her... Was maybe somebody that she met from this world. So we just follow her path. I mean, look... this tattoo right here is distinctive.
I got to admit... I was wrong about you. That so? I thought you were just some chick. Is that supposed to be a compliment?
I think you should take a beat and let her calm down. It's understandable why she's upset. I would be too. Yeah, you're right. Now, can I get your opinion on something?
Yeah, I came prepared. I'd expect nothing less. Good luck with your speech. Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck. It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
You're right. We're targeting Reed, right? But Hedstrom's got to be afraid that someone close to Reed is going to go down in the crossfire. His wife. Molly had these red marks on her wrist. What if that bracelet didn't belong to Kayla?
Those boys are in my trees again! They're devils for thieving! Bloody devils! There are no boys and nothing is being stolen, come back inside, please. Christ!
At this time, we'd like to remind the public that we are coordinating our efforts with Interpol as the Dodger operates primarily in Europe, and they have advised us to warn the public that he is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous. You know, I heard about this guy. They call him the Dodger because he avoids getting his hands dirty. He uses hostages to do his stealing for him. How? Puts a bomb collar around their necks.
We agreed. We promised. I thought you were OK with that. Yeah. That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
So can you explain why there's a room charged that night at the Empire Hotel on your credit card? Now, that is you, right? Dr. Colin Barnes? Yes, but I don't even have a MasterCard. What the hell is this?
It's best if you come with us. What a pity! You've got a cut! The dove! She threw it out the window.
We need to give the profile. We believe that these unsubs are two women who are killing people convicted of heinous crimes. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! He'll be out in 10 years.
"And turn the fuckin' air down in here!" Malcolm, Malcolm, just listen for a second. Yes. When we first met you, there was something attached to you. Oh, that was a hemorrhoid. That was...
This distorts and magnifies light from any other galaxy lying directly behind it. So, astronomers on Earth would see multiple images of that same distant galaxy, deformed, as in a funhouse mirror. 40 years after this prediction, we started finding them, too. And Zwicky made yet another discovery back in the 1930s. While studying the Coma Cluster of galaxies, he noticed something funny about the way they moved.
Dozens, okay? I spent hours searching through Japanese symbols, then Chinese, then Korean. Couldn't find a match to the bottom of the statue. - Oh, so a dead end? - No, breakthrough.
There is no good way of doing this. Josh is screening people. He's given you names. Sure. Then at any second, with any handshake, a door handle, railing or cough, that source goes from safe to unsafe.
See you, Lay. I am very proud to be your best man. I am your friend also, always at your side in my thoughts. I wish you lots of happiness in your new life as a married woman. The war was close at hand, just across the border, in Vietnam.
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working. So what does that mean? Clearly, there's an issue. I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it. That thing was possessed.
Oh... You know what? I think I'm gonna take a bath. There's nothing like stripping down to what you were born with and having a good, hot soak. It really relaxes the muscles. Well, my muscles are not sore.
Thank you. I beg you. And the other 50%? Aaron is one? That is the mystery with this syndrome.
He's a nice guy. We've been out for a drink. That's it. Tom, you know your ship? - Yeah.
In the barn. I'm afraid -- That's his watch! Oh, God. [ Voice breaking ] Oh, God. [ Crying ] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, what happened?
Congratulations. Thank you, Chloe. But actually, my name is Mrs Bouchtat now. Oh, Bouchtat. Does that mean your name is Rae Bouchtat?
Did you call an ambulance? You have to come over. It went under the couch. I can't even look. What if it's still alive?
All I did was love your friend. You could've been happy for us, but instead in your paranoia, you feared losing us both, and, because of that, you did. There is no one else to blame, Nik, only you. Where is Marcel now, hmm? I thought he loved you, and yet he left you trapped in here with me.
Let's go... So, what gives? I give. I mean, I will... give. I brought the antidote.

Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing. Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet.
Seven years at the top. You don't get there without making enemies. I haven't heard much talk of you on the compound. It worries me. The officers have also noticed a significant change in the women.
I don't want that. Tastes like ice cream. This is cancer-fighting ice cream. Honey, relax. The girls are fine.
Ok, here's what's happened. I checked all the employees and vendors and delivery people who work at the supermarket where Terry Rodgers bought his groceries, and there were no red flags. Also, Barry Deaver, the second victim, I found his car. - Where? - Impounded.
He was electrocuted. Oui, bien sur. Regarde. The table is clamped to the floor, so the current passes through it. It is, en effet, the killing machine most elaborate.
Not really any of your business. I'm just saying, he's a little young. He just has a youthful appearance. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Don't we have a steering wheel to get to Rigby?
Was. Ain't nothing left. Of course. Thomas, didn't we know someone with the railroad in meridian? Is there a railroad there, Mr. Bohannon?
Although that one there is not bad. That's not an Elf maid. That's funny. This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver. A famous blade... forged by the High Elves of the West, my kin.
Look. This tracks Lemon's location by her cell phone signal. Those fe this up when I got lost bringing her iced teduring that Civil War reenactment. accidently run into her. Those fe this up when I got lost And make her see just exactly what she's been missing.
- What? - Ivan, it's all going to hell. What? The rebars in the shuttering in pit six, they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fart. It's those mavericks from up north we put in there at the last minute.
That shouldn't bother you. Everybody who's worth knowing lives in London anyway, don't they? True. It was a silly idea of Guy's foisting the engagement on his poor mother. It was not silly at all!
You'll see to it if it comes to that? Of course, Father. - By God, she looks like a... - Yes, sir. It doesn't do, stealing the show from her mother-in-law!
I'll keep my eye out. Sheriff, I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't think you have a serious problem on your hands. I don't deny your abilities. It's just that your hands are tied by this office, whereas I have a talent for resolving problems like this one quietly. I appreciate your concern, but...
I gotta turn the tables on him and I will. As long as he keeps talking to me, I know I can find him and when I do, I will get your brother's letter back. Do either of you know what this key opens? Why would I know?
That's terrible. Can we get some fried chicken over here, stat! I am such a bad friend! Three slutty nuns show up at St. Peter's-- Wait, wait, they're not slutty.
- Isn't he romantic? - How would I know? I mean, can you think of a better place to go on vacation? - Yes. - Uh, so the baby food is in the fridge and the fresh diapers are in the dresser.
I'm so happy for you. Have you seen what I found? Do you want it for the baby's room? Maman, you still haven't redecorated this room. But...
It's quite a story. She was in the field when I went to her farm to pick up a cow. I had the ring because I thought it was a good chance. Like they say, Strike while the iron's hot! She was with her mother in the rice paddies.
To do what? To take control of our resources? Our gold mines, our diamonds, our uranium? No. You have already spoken of taking control of the mining franchise.
This clever lady has contrived a most intricate problem. I have been admiring the house. I thank you. It was built by my husband's greatgrandfather. There was an Elizabethan manor before.
♪ (distant chattering) (laughing) ...with me, behind the boat. Okay, everybody's ready? Take the tanks up in the pool.
how was your relationship with your wife? Everything good? Are you asking me that because you think I did it? No, no, we're just trying to get the whole picture. I loved my wife.
Each of the dates you mentioned corresponds with one of the 73 cardiac deaths. If you're right, he's killed nine people. We have our pattern; now we'll find our suspects. 23 suspects is a lot-- how long do you think it's gonna take you and Detective Bell to interview them?
I think it makes a lot of independent music right now possible. It's one of the reasons why we're able to make records for a couple hundred bucks. I think one of the big tape manufacturers went out of business, so that really pushed everybody into the digital world and the Pro Tools world. The days of moving into the studio and writing your record and recording your record and mixing your record, those days are gone now. They used to have $200,000, $300,000 $400,000 budgets to do an album.
If you'd like to talk to me again, please contact my attorneys. She's lying. She's being blackmailed. Which could mean that she had a motive to kill Nick. Yeah.
- How insulting it was? - Yeah. 'Cause but for a couple things that I didn't foresee, you wouldn't have found out. What the hell? Am I suddenly a fucking receptacle for every woman who's pissed at a guy?
Come on, girlfriend. Who's going to worry about me? Okay. You shouldn't look at that. Yeah, well, I try not to, but... This guy has written, like, half a fucking novel about how I don't have any talent left.
When I eventually get presented, the train has to be no less than three yards in length from the shoulders. It sounds rather ornate. It's tradition. For you, Mrs Selfridge. Oh!
Hydriatic procedures in the treatment of insanity were quite common I was not, I'm afraid, ever convinced of their efficacy. But I was the junior and he was my father. And your father, he employed this treatment? He gave up on it in the end.
Yeah. Seems like the wrong ones always survive. After he crossed the veneno linea, he headed this way. And if we do end up fighting him, just, whatever you do, stay away from his tentacles. Why?
In our striving for improvement, we lose sight of something just as important. Maybe we should try to accept what's already pretty good about ourselves. And not everything needs fixing. Mozart's music is 200 years old. It doesn't require any upgrade.
I'll show Zoe to her room. Then we meet for Midday Gathering. Let's go. Miss Robichaux's Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies was established as a premiere girls' finishing school in 1790. During the Civil War, it was converted into a military hospital.

Okay, fine. For you, I'll think about it. Bam! Still hate it. How does this work?
Read it! - I read it. You want to expand, hire, buy land... And you're certain you'll have a 30% return within a year. 30-40%, Giampiero, it's a conservative estimate. It's not exactly a gift, you know...
I should have done this yesterday. - Nothing's gonna be here, man. - You don't know that. - Yeah. Look at this place. - I know. It's been gutted.
Ready to see me win some money? I fixed Lily's presentation. My stepmom and dad said I couldn't get a puppy. So they got me a plant. Life gave me lemons, and I made science.
Hey! Sorry I been gone so long, but I think you'll appreciate what I was up to. I was finding your money. Ray's money. That's what you want, right? I can take you to it.
No, it's important that you come. Important to whom? To me. All right, listen to me. When you were four years old, you came home one day with a cat.
I was going to prick you, but... this works too. You know, an experiment of this magnitude could be very risky for you. Your system could accept the sudden and all... encompassing changes very well. - Or.
She worked for the National Security Council. Miss Corwin, are you there? You've been looking for me? Can we meet? No.
It's just Rudy! I'm Ghostbusters, he's Ghostbusters II, and everybody knows Ghostbusters II was a right piece of shit. I quite liked it. You fucking would, wouldn't you? Do you know ecstasy reverses your power?
I'll make him eat his broccoli uh, brush his teeth, in bed at 8:00... [ Chuckles ] No, in bed by 7:00. - 7:00, of course. Eric: - Mom! Look! Oh, what happened?
We really wanted to be inside Hugh's head. This shallow depth of field-- it's quite stunning. The focus was unbelievably difficult for our assistant cameraman. Sometimes we're dealing with literally focus, you know, of half an inch. Literally, if you just breathe with the camera, you're soft in your shot. You're soft.
Yeah, but we never had a beef with the guy... not that I can remember. No mother? She was killed. Car accident. Highway 18, just after the kid was born. That might be the connection.
Why, what happened? Well, I take my son to family time while my wife does yoga, but last week, when I walked Evan back, she noticed a truck driving behind us. Like following you? Yeah. You remember what the truck looked like?
That's okay. It's probably a sign that I should be getting out of this business. I have a cousin in Long Beach who sells sleep apnea machines. She says they're always looking for new reps. But this job is your dream.
Photos? Oh, while you were away I was looking at old albums and found this picture. Do you remember? It's that mansion. When you first came, you wouldn't let it go.
Yeah. Wh-what is she doing? She's doing the backstroke. I taught her that. Jane, maybe your subconscious didn't send you any clues from the crime scene.
Man versus van at 1:00 a.m. last night. He was killed instantly. Knocked right out of his shoes at the point of impact. So a hit and run. Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Rhonda had office hours at home, so there were students there all the time, and faculty, and she had a lot of friends. [ elevator bell dings ] - I'll call you if we have anything. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Excuse me.
One... Don't. Two... Did the bullet come out the front? Did the bullet come out the front of his head?
♪ Will ya look at the state my trees are in? ♪ ♪ They help your trees they'll grow stronger faster. ♪ ♪ They've turned my life to a total disaster. ♪ ♪ Well, I, for one, don't have a doubt. ♪ ♪ These vermin must be stamped right out. ♪
That is my definition of robust. My speech is a face-melter. These buzz cuts are gonna flip. It's not your speech. My fingerprints are all over that sucker.
No, the clinic was being used as a one-stop shop for identity theft with the occasional spot of cosmetic surgery when needed - as in Mr Vincent's case - to finish the job. All run by Dr Jones, under everyone's nose. We've already established Valerie Dupree was frightened the night that she died. We also have a witness who saw her clearly uncomfortable in the presence of the man we know as Paul Vincent. 'I think they were having some kind of lover's tiff.'
She wasn't you. I gotta go. I mean, you gotta admit, it was pretty rad. I locked a vampire in her dorm with an invisible seal. I mean, how many newbie witches have that on their resume?
- Yes. Water. Two liters a day, as recommended by the Mayo clinic. You couldn't possibly tell how old that speck of blood is. Yes, I can. It's simple.
Who said that? - Steve Berna. - Oh, he's hot, but so dumb. Leigh Anne Morris changed her profile picture to that. She looks like a walrus with a UTI.
Yes! No. Wait, no, yes, no, yes, no, no, yes, no. You know, when I was a kid, I used to think that there were people in the radio. Like, these little itty-bitty people that climbed in and played on their mini instruments and sang into their tiny microphones! That's stupid.
Shh. Shh. Shh. But Dairy Queen? Dairy Queens are like California real estate.
I follow a man he is called Wirepa. Even now he walks through your lands as if you do not exist. Be quiet! Mind those wives of mine, boy. You know what they are doing?
Is it a tandem Speedo for two men? Eh, even this is too loose. Mark, hop in here! Did they get this on sale? Was this the floor model?
This is so amazing. If anything, I would have thought there was something going on between you and Marty. Mmm. You know, that ship sailed a long time ago. So there was a ship?
This will give you another heart attack! And if I can't get that through your head, I will take it up with child services. In fact, that's the best idea I've had all day. The ethical thing would have been for my client's mother to be told that her body parts, upon her death, would be used to derive revenue for the hospital, whether or not they saved lives. The honest thing would be to tell people that even while there's a ban on organ sales in this country, there's nothing to stop the hospitals from selling tissues and parts to other countries, which they routinely do.
! Once would be nice! No. Rodney open this door. Give me that weapon. Oh. You mean this rocket launcher?
Well, it's fun to finally interact with experimentalists. I mean, I used to be just in my office, coming up with, you know, crazy ideas. It's a big thing. There is a general sense waiting for this machine to start, this massive machine that has taken so many years to build. We are all in great anticipation of what it might find.
- Well, good. Then this won't take long. Robert? Robert, are you here? Why were you the one the girls would bring home?
He is so weak he cannot eat. Pray to the gods, please, for him. Wait, no. I said no. No.
I'm sorry, but you got to go back. Listen, you've been looking for that evidence box for, what, three months now? I've been after it for 30 years. Now you say you're close. When WITSEC moved Ellen to New York 12 years ago, they gave her a job at a securities firm.
Or what if it doesn't within ten years? Or within 20 years? And, uh, good old Pincus is pissing in his diaper in a nursing home somewhere unable to afford his pudding cup. The law is gonna change, Jeannie. Unless it doesn't.
- Yeah, yeah. Dani has one note. Can she be in a party and look like that energy's different than what her normal, like "hey"? These lines feel real, like, swag. Right.
She might have been wearing any of them. Oui, but we also have the evidence of the dog. - Dog? What dog? - No. Please, be patient.
They couldn't do nothing without that music sitting right in their face. People would see us walk in. They wondered what we were doing there. They handed us our music and we took it like we was pros too, like we would really read this. Then as you got more into the music, people would want background singers that were free enough to put feeling in what they were singing.
You need to do something. I'm trying to do something, Riley. The brain works much like a computer, okay, even without the chip. There's short-term memory... ram, if you will... and there is long-term memory, a hard drive known as the hippocampus.
Will wants his mother as far away from the bar as possible, and all of you Glee kids have dated so incestuously that I can't even remember who can tolerate who anymore, so... Look, I'm-I'm worried about not being able to do this. Being able to look Mr. Shue in the eyes. Look, I'm really sorry that I don't have a pamphlet handy for you right now, but I'm pretty sure if I did, it would say something like, "Get Over It," okay? My therapist says that I use my OCD to control the uncontrollable.
I mean, why... why am I... No one knows why they're chosen. One day the box just shows up and it starts. After that, there's no getting out.
To live here, the snow needs to evolve - and she's the blueprint. She's what they need to become. When the snow melted last night, did the pond? No. Living ice that will never melt.
Okay, dummy. Okay, Han, I can't hold you up anymore. Max, I think I just saw the murder car go by, out the bathroom window. - What exactly did you see? - A car.
Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. Did I say that out loud? Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess. I bet they are absolutely lovely.
I can't find anything. There's a problem here. You're delving into the origins of Muslims' deepest beliefs but where is the historical evidence? Sometimes the belief of the believer, and the understanding of the scholar, cannot be squared. It's a choice between doing history and not doing history.
Jung-hwa, don't go easy on her! Go kick her ass! I can do it! HYUN Jung-hwa won the singles title at 42nd WTTC and became the first Korean player to achieve the Grand Slam North Korea recognized Ll Bun-hui's service at Chiba WTTC and received the title 'DPRK's Athlete' with YU Soon-bok
It doesn't work like that. If he'd been exposed, it would present itself in his blood... within a few hours, if not a few minutes. All right, everybody. Let's put our panties back on and see how we can help our friend. You said the virus mutates. How do you know the strain in Nicaragua wasn't different... from the other ones you've seen?
I will check it out. Nicely done. Surprised? No. Pleased. Why didn't the girls just say they were on P.C.P.?
Throws the blame over here again. Seriously, I was like, "Danny, hit it, this guy is amazing, "you could really help him to make your team a better team." Thank you very much. Unfortunately, we toured with Train over in America, and I've heard that version and Pat Monahan singing it every night, and he goes hell-for-leather on it with the emotion. I was looking for that fire in my belly, and I didn't hear it.
And if I can help in any way, please... don't hesitate to ask. Yes. As attending physician of Jed Potter, I'll need his autopsy report for my files. I'm very busy, Doctor. But I'll try to locate it.
Tell that to their wives. I don't think they were all married. You're a hero. Well, that depends on the definition, really. The women of America, they owe you their thanks.
Hang with me, Mellish. I know you can. We have been concentrating this whole time on the men these women are dating. But what if, what if... it's one of the other women. One who's jealous. Women.
That is one lucky, squirrelly, little son of a bitch. You know, they used to call this hog-killing weather. Back before refrigeration, you could not kill a pig in the summertime. No, that meat wouldn't last you long enough to be worth your while. Yep, sweet spot is late autumn, just before the cold sets in.
Mom. Hey, Morn! Sit down. I'm gonna close the window. And she wasn't here. And then I heard a sound from my room, and I-- I came in and the window was open. And....
Fantastic. Okay. The FBI agent's in critical condition. Where are Ilyana and Katya? Czech police found them before Steve got there.
So when can we have the bullet? I'll take it from here, doctor. Why didn't he answer my question? He just did, but it went over your shiny little head. The heart is like any other tissue.
Who can take us seriously when we are so far from who we once were. Our strange behavior and fumbled sentences... change others perceptions of us... and our perception of ourselves. We become ridiculous... incapable... comic. But this is not who we are. This is our disease.
Oh, you told me to keep an eye on Lydia, and, um, he's had a crush on her since, like, third grade, so, I'm gonna have to talk to him. I know it's hard.. Sitting here.. Trying not to look at him. But think of how strong it makes you.
No questions asked. You swear to me? I swear. I'd like to present you all with this star, this... beacon... of Bethlehem. It was handcrafted for the Archdiocese of Boston.
I'm all set to emigrate. - What's put that in your head? - I want to be where the sun goes when it sets here. Do you see? When it gets dark here it gets light over there.
This is a police report from 1966, where a 16-year-old girl was found raped in a parked car on that street. But she was a minor, so her name wasn't listed on the report. Well, what's this girl got to do with a serial killer? Pump your brakes, sweetcakes, 'cause I'm bringing it home. It turns out that Jane Doe, instead of given a name, she was given a patient number.
That's a good life lesson, yeah. Everyone's disgusting. I'll get you a towel. Such a gentleman. It's a bit damp but it's OK.
Um, "yes". Huh? But it could have been a "no". Oh. This is the first Vampire Fruit Bat I've ever met and well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language. Uh-huh.
Come on. Fire has a downside. We just have to learn how to control it. Yeah, but this can't be controlled. I mean, it's not science.
There's no need. But if you like, we can take another look. See... Now we're in the esophagus. It's going further... It's not yet in the stomach. Look, this opening is the entry to the stomach.
There has got to be something that we can do. This is an Oval Office nightmare now. What do the Russians want with L.A.'s nuclear detection system? The Cold War's heating up. Friend or foe, nations collect intel on each other.
Needless to say, you were right to keep Daniel in the dark this afternoon. The boy will soon run the company toward the ground, proving little use to the Initiative. On the contrary. I think he handled himself very well today. Seemingly.
You know, I'm on Dennis's side now... he just convinced me. Uh, hold-hold on one second though, Charlie. It occurs to me that Frank assumed responsibility for a potential spill the second he took the wine. Yeah, he's right. I knew the risk.
Jakes put him on a boat. He's probably on another continent by now. You're not gonna find Briggs on any map. I'm trying to find him up here. Did you know that there was another house before this?
We ligate the inferior and superior vena cava, pulmonary artery, vein, and aorta so the organ may be removed. Now, why does the heart need to be removed in the first place? Because the large cancer mass on the back wall of the left atrial chamber is inaccessible in its anatomic position. Good, and what is the hemodynamic significance of the location of this tumor? As Mary's left atrium pumps blood, the opposite wall balloons instead of contracting, impeding blood flow.
Until we're ready all of this remains confidential. No gossip. Do you understand? All right. Go on.
To Larry, Alan, and Dan. Maybe they felt like they didn't know who they were. But we know. They were our friends. The body was identified as that of local author and psychologist Dr. Konstantin Brinkerhoff.
Yes. I am. Senator Colton, what do you have to say about these allegations from your wife? I'd say I'm disappointed and heartbroken. My wife has decided to sling mud, falsely.
I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music. Okay, I'm sorry that I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or The Beatles. You don't like The Beatles? That's-- That's not the point. Eleanor Rigby? Paperback Writer?
- We'll show ourselves out. I apologize. What? You got nothing to apologize for. That's what parents do.
♪ Everything ♪ Is crystal clear... I did it! Close that door immediately! What's up?
He's one of the best taxidermy artists on the west coast. But enough about stuffing dead animals. Sit down. I'm gonna tell you a little story about real, living things. Four girls from Shunyi, China, get told that, if they come to America illegally and work as housemaids, they will get citizenship in seven years.
I dunno what else to do, Emma. He's coming for us, you know. No, not for me. I'm not too sure about that, Ems. I can't just feed her to the fucking crocodiles.
See, I would have expected you to have an extra-special suit tailor-made just for this occasion. Oh, I did. I had my boy Timmy G make the perfect wedding suit. You ever heard of "bespoke"? This suit was be-freaking-screamed.
Meantime, we located that cabbie. He says two female passengers saw the attack on a video call. They told him to call 911. Then they bolted from the cab. But he gave us the building where he picked the girls up, and the doorman there I.D.'d them.
Woman's place is more at home than to advance herself too much. I know the girls in my office feel the way I do. We're all right the way we are. There's nothing wrong with this. I'm totally against it. I feel I don't know what they're being liberated from.
Look, you can do what you want, but you will be the only one in this entire prison that does. You want that? Be my guest. Count time! Count time! Count time, ladies!
But couldn't make the trip. New Brunswick? That's, like, an hour away. They weren't close. Juan's death reminds us how short life is.

This must be it. - Your wife's loving it. - Only the best! I got a rush when I stole this... Hey, I found a watch over here. You got the client's address?
I should sleep in my own bed. Why? Because I bought it. Stay. But take off your socks. - It's hairless?
- Nuh-uh. - Uh-uh. Seen stranger. - Not really. - I've seen stranger. - Artie! - Yeah?
And she'd be grateful for what I did for her. But there's only so many like that. And that's why you went after Nina. If Nina's heart hadn't stopped, she would've been grateful too. Society's not ready for me.

It just about put me on the ground. So, we'll... we'll go through his mail, I just... I'm sorry. I don't understand how it's so easy for you. It-It's not that it's easy for me.

If you tell anyone, you'll be sorry. At your orders, queen. A blood vow to Apollo commits you for life. I know what I'm doing. I don't know this look.

You're a whore, the baby's a bastard... but there's no word for the man who doesn't come back. One day... on your wedding day... ..you'll have a good man on your arm... ..and you'll say, "Polly... "thank you for common sense." This woman is in Cardiff. We'll take the train tomorrow. Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.
I know we just started dating, but the truth is, if this actually goes somewhere, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do or how this is supposed to work. Okay. Why don't you start by telling me what you'd do to a guy who stood you up? That's more like it. What are you doing?
- How bad? - It was really bloody in there. It was... - Don't! I stitched her main coronary artery shut. She's having a heart attack.
Hm. Which is hard enough for normal people to get through. Hey, what would you say if I could be normal? I've been thinking about it ever since we saw her at the hospital. Lydia was bit by an Alpha, right?
Insulin-like growth factor 1, a hormone. It has anabolic effects in adults. Okay. Well, I failed Greek and never took "geek," so try English. Your body makes this stuff naturally.
You know, they're different. I mean, boys are-- are simpler. You know, a boy's got a problem, you take him to a ball game, you get him a hotdog-- they're copasetic. They're--they're good to go, and, I mean... Girls are--you gotta walk around on eggshells with 'em.
Eventually I went out and bought a bunch of Post-its and kind of tried to figure out what it was we needed to do. My horrific task was to go through the entire movie and pull out the stills to put on the website. And at the same time I was learning who these people were that I could see their flesh being torn off their bodies. Photographs taken by US soldier The Army claimed it was engaged in "combat operations against a hostile force."
It's okay. These are cutthroat's girls. Ask her if she recognizes this knife. She says this is the same kind of knife cutthroat used on her neck. Does she know these two girls?
And look out for any others. The victim fell through the ceiling... and broke his ankles. His bones were smashed so he couldn't escape. -It was a trap. -Yeah. The killer then went on to inflict as much suffering and pain as possible.
The biopsy results came back positive for ductal infiltrating carcinoma, which is the most common type of male breast cancer. Lucky me. You know, ductal means that the cancer originated in the ducts of the breast. And your tumor is almost 5 centimeters, which is large. There is also a chance
Are you going to scold me, Pepper? Why do you keep putting me in that position? I don't want to be the only adult in this relationship. It's intriguing, though. I find I'm drawn to more mature women.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure of an introduction. Legele says you're descended from our line. The legends are true. Come here. I understand that this ring was passed down through generations of our family.
So where did they go? Yeah, still working on it. Excuse me. Yeah, Ryan here. Maybe they knew each other.
Call an ambulance. You okay? I'm fine. He's not. Stopped to rest.
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in and it would pop up and I'd put the... push it back down again or something. Toast it twice. Big deal. On several occasions, she left the stove on. OK? Burnt up the spice rack, the whole wall. If you remember your grandmother, she was frightening.
Okay. All right. I don't know if this is related, but this Elkins woman... she was Mike's type. Type in what way? Here's how it worked with him.
- show her the town? - I love to do that. But it's tricky out there. It's not like when you were... Women are scary now.
! A whale? ! A kraken? Worse. Mermaids. Mermaids? !
And then, after that, It's one stake through his heart. Did you hear me, seth? I'm in. There's all kinds of markings on these walls.
Your labs came back, and you are anemic. That's why you've been so tired. I want you to take an iron pill twice a day with prunes. Prunes? I hate prunes.
I'm so sorry. Well, what are you up to right now? Stop it. Okay. Don't beat yourself up. It's a numbers game. And you've only called, like, what, 25 girls?
It's time to own myself. Votes or no votes, if we succumb to this endless BS, we lose. And I am here to win. For every Irish woman who is sick and tired of the fish-stenched mouth of sexism. And so, our brave ladies of the night planned a subliminal campaign for the ages.
Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon. I've been staring at this board for days. I'm so close to putting it together. There's got to be something we missed. Let's go over this again.
I mean, this guy Solis could barely crack 20 homers a season a few years ago. And now he's banging out over 40 a year? What's that supposed to be, the wisdom of age? And you don't even have to look at what he's doing on the field to wonder if this guy is juicing. Just take a look at him.
Wait, did you strike out Albert Pujols? No, I did not. He hit it. Far. Very, very far.
Hey! Help! I'm here! I'm still here! All the other students were killed in the crash. I stayed by the fire as long as I could.
Could I say no? Yeah, but then we come back with a warrant and you better be lawyered up, Gregory Hines. The dancer guy? - I don't know why I said that. - I don't either.
Last week, I had my yearly tax seminar. It's usually only attended by Dash and Sergeant Jeffries and Shula. Standing room only. All single women. Well,
Hey. Hey, stay where you are. Robinson, stop her! Ma'am, stop now. Hold up. What else did she tell you about this cat? Anything?
He's gonna send agents after us. We're running out of time. I have a program that could help, but it's on my office computer. (Whirring) What exactly is this program supposed to do? - Because it's not doing it.
What if that version of Kyle changes? Well... if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Linette? You betcha. Look, your brother can't just come back here with flowers and pretty words and "I'm sorrys"
- Ah, yes, the vehicle that you mentioned on the phone. You see, it makes a great deal of financial sense for me to buy a car of that price and then to ship it home. I'm head of the division of economic affairs, so you'll forgive me if I take a little pride in knowing how to strike a bargain. I'm not sure how you're gonna feel about your bargain now. That's my car?
What if something attacks me? Well, you'll just have to be faster than one of us. That creature just got a hell of a lot harder to find. What is this place? Must be some kind of temporal junction.
So how is this happening? You really have no idea what you are, do you? What the fuck's that supposed to mean? OK. First... experts are the people that you see on TV.
The FBI came to see me. - About what? - I don't know. They were asking me a lot of questions about why I was on the bridge. I think we should stop... just for now. No, stopping now defeats the purpose of what we've just done.
I liked Haley. But my wife liked anything but Haley. Yeah. Well, Katrina seems to be a popular name right now. You know, ah...
Not just their queen. "The" Queen. When I was collecting souls on the battlefield; knowing who served whom ... I had to memorize every crest there ever was.
Frankly, they've become uncomfortable. Look, man, I'm sorry if this is all my fault. I-I really thought having Eden move in was the right decision, but it seems like it just pissed everyone off. It'll be fine. I'll give Eden some space.
I found your old pantyhose commercial online. Hey, 54 views. Not too shabby. After a long day in the office, your legs must be tired and aching. Not at all.
We both know this isn't about money. It's about justice. I'm going to take everything away from you, Gavin, just like you do to everyone else. You fancy yourself a hero then? No, I'm... just a man who's found a way to get back what you stole from me a long time ago.
I'm gonna go to the restroom, collect my thoughts, and when I come back, we'll continue this conversation. Okay, you do that. Just one? I can do this in one. What's it like being counsel for Taco Corp now that he actually has some money?

Lisa's parents said that Lisa went to the library last night. So I had campus security send over security footage. She was never at the library. Well, maybe our perp abducted her before she ever got there. Actually, I think she lied about where she was going.
Yes, secretary-general to be precise. Yeah. I am going to get you a tutor while you're here. No, tutors are boring. Well...
Ела тук. Дай ми целувка. Let's piss off your forefathers. Malcolm, it's 2013. Interracial relationships are not a big deal anymore. Yeah, you tell that to the sistas.
- Calm down, Randy. - Not until you back off. Well, I don't think I can now! She blew snot on the ground, and it gave me the feelings! Then I guess this competition just got competitive.
The governor and I have organised this event but it's us women that made it happen. 'I've changed.' I've changed. I've changed. So, I want everyone to be clear about how things will run today. Liz has organised the women.
I want a new bed. We need a new bed. I want to turn our bedroom into a sanctuary. Ohh! Here we go.
And if it isn't them? Then this is an abduction. Put an amber alert on the girl. Get pictures of Trettel and his wife to the media, any news outlet that will pick up the phone. I called you as soon as I could.
We must make her feel it is her duty to save Downton. But how? What can we do? Get her to sense its value, its vital role in the area. You're her granddaughter.
Excuse me? What this firm did to that woman was unconscionable. You piece of shit. Monica Eton deserved to get fired. Huh. The eight women I'm gonna stack the jury with might disagree with that.
But, of course, not everyone thinks like I do. Which is why you had to pay Pradeep until his demands escalated past the point that you could meet them. Then you cast about for a way to kill him. Now, you already had threatening letters from the ELM. So you built a pipe bomb, planning to blame them.
Yeah, but... Oh, shit. I think it's gonna take a few sessions to really get the whole picture. Is it? Ha- - I was just out buying new shoes and I remembered I didn't want to give you that hundred bucks.
Oh, yes, I was definitely gonna want to go over ground rules. to check curfew recommendations on their "How late? Debate." Their rule of thumb is 11:00 PM unless you've earned your parents' trust, in which case, it'd be midnight. Have I earned your trust, mom? You have, but Darrin hasn't, and he's just so dumb. I'll see you at 11:00.
Anything for you, Carrie. Is that the real reason you didn't come with me to Kabul, you already had one foot out the door? Mostly I just didn't want to live in a bunker and kill people by remote control. That's harsh. Ever since that kid in Caracas, covert operations have been over for me.
How are things going? We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over in Manhattan Beach, so it takes like an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian. What do you mean, a lesbian?
We have to get out of here while we still got the chance. I love you. Not the way that I want to be loved, not the way that you love Clarke. It's over, Finn. The dropship is still tied in to all of our major systems.
Like Tatyana's. Yes. I tell girls I meet, "if you see her, you call me," "and if you call me, I get you out of the life as well."
Sixteen women, Peter. You killed them because... - You weren't worthy of them. - You killed them. You killed them.
Go on. The second crime, the robbery, was committed by a man. A very strong man judging by the items he removed from the apartment. How strong does a guy have to be to steal a wallet and a watch? You're forgetting the armoire.
That's the thing-- she's, uh... she's concerned 'cause Chin had an appointment today and he didn't show up. Well, Chin's on the North Shore. But he called me last night to confirm his session. I've been trying to reach him, but he hasn't answered or returned my calls. Hey, Chin's not on the North Shore.
This is the Fox coverage, which was about does pepper spray hurt? Now you see-- Then I guess the pepper spray happens right there and the women go down. Arthur, I don't know. I see these women screaming. It's like they've been shot in the face.
We're locked out of the Lock-In. Oh, you decided to stay. Why? You know when you decide you hate an item of clothing so you give it to your maid? And then you see your maid wearing it and you're like, "Why'd I ever give it away?
I would need to do a number of vocal exercises before I attempted that. I think the lyrics so much sum up the recording business. Rock 'n' roll, man. # You're gonna go far. # The record companies were... they were all-powerful, in a way.
Find another prince? You've forgotten Phillip already. Phillip is in my heart every moment of every day. If there was anything I could do to bring him back, I would. Is that so?
Yeah, hold the pickle, ha-ha! And that's how you pick the weeds! Which ones are the weeds? They all are. Why are the weeds inside?
She found something? She's back here, isn't she? She's back at Selfridges. I want to put a whole family in it. Father, mother, children.
I shouldn't be away from my fluids anyway. Dr. Hamburg said I need to be on them for 24 to 48 hours and it's barely been 24. Man, you are being even more anal now, than you were in the sport's car. Come on. Hospital rules are not law.
You didn't name Sparkles "Sparkles"? No. She did. After one of her precious cats. And to top it all off, she put the cat to sleep.
We have to warn them all in person. Go get 'em, Wolfy. Bo! Hale is gone! Missing. Oh... what?
Come in and shut the door. You wanna tell me what's going on? I don't know what you mean. Well, since when does a 250-word obit turn into a 2-column expose on cold war espionage? This Mr. Diebold story, it...
Tell me. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Where's my daughter? Four days have passed since Anna Dover and Joy Birch... were last seen by their families.
Please. I'm tired of cleaning up your messes. Take care of this. Yes, Nana. What are you doing?
- Yeah. The first time I went golfing after Patty died, women were throwing themselves at me. It was like I was the lesbian Fonzie. Gaaaay! Women are so great.
Excuse me? Why is Gerald's booth closed? It's so sad. He passed away late last night. You know, he was sick... cancer.
How can I help? Be available. I may need you, somehow. Wow, rich, man. This looks like a new blade inset in a much older handle, so the fish is a bitch, semiotically speaking, like a universal wayback symbol of fecundity.
Maybe a few decades ago, but not anymore. Those four corners have been all but forgotten. It's not even called Hell's Kitchen anymore. "Clinton" does have a nicer ring to it. So why is the violence suddenly back?
Thanks for stopping. No one else passed by all day. 'Cause hardly no one uses this route no more. How'd you all get out here? Ah, we're businessmen.
Well, Danny would still be in jail if it wast for you. And I just heard that the Justice Department is launching an investigation into Grantham Pace as a result of what you did. Thank you. Just thought you should know that. You know, I don't always...

Amazing. That was one of the best auditions I've ever seen. Really? Oh yeah. I mean, you just went for it. Oh my God thank you guys so much.
You know you've got only, you know, create a clean energy infrastructure to replace the fossil fuel infrastructure we have, but we have to create yet another one, or maybe two of 'em between now and 2050 or 2100; in order to reduce our emissions, to stabilize the climate. And, that is just nothing that anybody has really been talking about or dealing with over the last 20 years. It comes as a shock to alot of environmentalists to hear this, but coal is not only the most widely-used source of energy in the world, it's also the fastest growing source of energy. It's use is accelerating world-wide-- faster than natural gas, faster than renewables, faster than anything else. When I have spoken to women's groups, none of them knew how bad coal was.
Here, are all the flowers women like! Roses which stand for burning love. Lillies which mean a pure love. Tulips are a confession of love. These are all flowers that are related to love.
There are real witches, Ingrid, living among us, hiding right in plain sight. I believe they came here a very long time ago from a different world. - Asgard. - Asgard? This place is a myth.
I was with him. But I thought... I assumed... That he did it to himself? When the time came, he asked for my help, and I gave it to him.
I think she wants us to have something sentimental in case it goes south. You're gonna introduce me to her one day. Thank you. For not trying to talk me out of this. So you've just received what we're calling the prototype decoy.
Sue, I've been here an hour, and you haven't even asked about me. How's my girlfriend in Canada? She's great. Thanks for asking. How come I'm not driving my Miata?
When you start getting older, then you realize, everyone is not the same, that these are gifts, and you have to share and go out into the world. Whoo! Oh, my girlfriend and I took these. It was supposed to be closed. You see the zipper is broken.
- It's probably gas. Calling the gas company. This is a lot of work. But it's worth it. The apartment is awesome.
I always push myself too hard. You should know that by now. Your call. (Jackie) You're gonna hear a lot of crazy rumors in the next few days. So this happens with every deployment.
But to create a paradox like that takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got? Tell me, come on, what? I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.
Okay. There's been a water leak... Not in my apartment there hasn't. If you'll let me finish. Thank you.
My parents sailed the same route 20 years ago, and I had my logbook from my parents, so every day I was looking at what their speed was. So I was racing against them. They took about 19 days, and I did 18, so yeah, pretty awesome. ♪ When I was younger,
But she'll always have those memories. I know I won't forget 'em, and I just heard about it. You didn't actually clip your toenails in front of her, did you? I hid nothing from that woman. Women like a little mystery.
That a technical term? It is when your organs look like this. Oh. Really? Deterioration happened recently and very fast. Tox reports came back clean, except for the presence of Paxil, a common antidepressant.
Don't you know men who come here never leave? I am here to speak with the warrior who is said to live here. I am a chief. Is that right? A chief?
- Well, I'm fine, so... - Yeah. Well, it's tough, you know. Women. They just...
Bless him. I used to make loads of horror movies with my mates. Tons of tomato sauce. Put it back! All right. What a beauty!
It's gonna be cold, though. - You should stay here. Okay, you guys, Marina totally checked out my boobs in the shower. Those girls hate me.
Whore as in, like, literal description. I'm a fucking feminist. What you want isn't for sale. Destiny doesn't trade real magic for money. She trades everything else. It's not the same.
I'm going to make a friend from another culture. Good deed number 67, right on. Change the world one friend at a time. What's your plan, Colleen? Uh, well, I'm e-mailing my picture to some Japanese girls who have their Web site video on this phone.
That's not funny. You didn't answer. Do you love him? Oh... I was at secondary school when he asked for my hand.
But what will you do? Anyone persecuting him should also consider that fact. Do you really think you can kill him? I have a proposal. What is it? The details of Eren's Titan power remain uncertain.
I'm with your mom - and your grandmother. - Are they okay? They just want to come home, and they need your help. Okay, so what do I need to do?
I can see that. Uh, how about a key? I have a key, but it's padlocked from the outside. Well, I cannot break that door down. Why not?
I'm heading home. All right. Did you even eat today? You know, I can't recall. Those grenades.
SKIP: You know, a lot of people think that the key to s'mores is the chocolate, but it's really the marshmallow... and the graham crackers... Why aren't we just using our own kitchen? 'Cause I'm taking you to the beating heart of the kitchen system, Bec! The microwave in there is crazy powerful.
Sit there, and I'll go and find out if I can get us in. Sit there? In full view of everybody? Of course, the police won't look for him here - you've got to hold your nerve, Sarah. Bernard, you and your friends are going to play the music for us, are you not?
The King used them to bring his companions in and out of the palace. Seems I'm not the only one who grew tired of his partnership with you. All right, Your Majesty. You're going to help me find the Knave's heart. I didn't know it was missing.
It will take one of nature's greatest feats of navigation to cross this lifeless wasteland. A wilderness that stretches not just to the horizon, but almost beyond imagination. It's an immense blank space on the map. In spite of the Sahara's reputation, less than one-fifth of it is sand. The rest is stone and wind-scoured rock.
"Your mum's dead," you know? Jesus, Jim, that is cold-blooded, even for you. I've looked into it. All right, it's not as easy as you think anyway, all right? It turns out that terminally ill women don't want to get pregnant.
Threatening her isn't the way to motivate her. Well, I'm all out of fish food. Doesn't matter if you get her to talk. You can't trust her. Mermaids are liars.
Odds're against you there, babe. Mom believes women don't grow more attractive with age. Oh, I disagree, I.. - No.. I didn't say they "don't grow more attractive,"
Am I suspended, sir? You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun? Sir, I realize that... Do you know how this reflects on me? Not only do you abandon your post for coffee. You could've killed a bystander. That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
Yes! But let's not get caught in this loop again. I-I mean, all my life, I've had to lie to women to have fantastic sex. Turns out, all I had to do was be honest. It's almost ridiculous in its simplicity. From now on, I'm just gonna be totally honest with women.
- We're very well off. Well, I can do a 24-hour hold for a $200 deposit. And that's cash or check. Mom, write the check right now. Mr. Braverman, look, I got to be honest here, this puppy's not gonna last long.
- Wendy, please listen, I need you to focus. - If I could just get to the portal... - No! Absolutely not. If that portal opens, we have no idea what may come through from the other side!
and you become addicted. It's hard to get a seat. To keep the ... It is even harder. A wrong bevægelse, and you can lose everything.

Can't. I'm masturbating! Caroline, what are you doing? Are those new shoes? Uh, yes.
I looked at these stickers, the non-standard alloy wheels, and I suspect this has been slammed. It does look like it's been slammed. It's been lowered. So you add those things together, and I've deduced it was probably owned by...a parish priest? June Whitfield, probably.
No. Jack sent me down here to find out what you know about gardening. So, Lecter gave you the all-clear. Therapy might work on you after all. Therapy is an acquired taste which I have yet to acquire.
Doc... tor... Doctor... That's weird. Those ones don't usually wake up for anything. Yeah, well - special visitor.
There's something philosophically about this piece of art that bothers me. It's taking a lot of sort of random things and making some order out of it. Yes. It's trying to make order out of something where there isn't any, instead of taking things that don't seem ordered and figuring out that there is order. The way we try to reduce the complexity of the world is by looking for patterns, what we call symmetries. We take all the particles we know today, and we attempt to fit them into some kind of underlying structure.
Turn back that way again. They're both turning away from the shot. Because Donna saw the gun, so it wasn't random. All right, so she screams "gun," and they both instinctively turn away. But there was no bullet hole in the car door.
Six, except. Seven... a human body is not like a crosstie. Eight, animal magnetism. Nine, the animal magnetism of a human body... makes the stress come slanting... so a coffin is built on the bevel. Ten, if you look at an old grave site... you'll see where the earth is sucked towards the bevel.
Anything moves, I'll-- Where'd you go? Repeat, all units, robbery in progress, Gotham City Trust. You see that other car? Just went the other way.
Hah.. Not anymore. - Oh, now -- You're still beautiful. One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.
Who is that talking? Oh, that's my friend Samantha. - Is she a girl? - Yeah. I hate women.
Katie doesn't deserve to die. You're in no position to be so principled. You can't win a war without a few strategic losses, no matter how regrettable they may be. How many times have the vampires been one step ahead, known something they shouldn't, your sister executed in the public square for practicing magic who knew she'd be caught? Did she even attempt to flee?
Well, we need to call the police. Not a good idea. They usually bring the gasoline. My office has already dispatched an urgent request to any UN forces in the area, but we've been ordered back to base. Maybe your girls can find someplace else to go as a precaution.
- Hi. Come in or whatever. I just jogged over here to feed the cat. If I don't shower right away my pores get all clogged and I get this, like, zit nest on my forehead. So why are you feeding the cat?
Jordy just told me Maggie Kester is one of them. She's lying. Maggie's one of them. Maggie, you're getting a message.
Let's go! The sex offender from the playground falls asleep here? - Not a good sign. - Could be the joint he smoked. Allen was winding down from a night shift.
- I farted on her pillow. - Nice. Look, you should tell Joel what you told me. Oh, hello. Your, uh, classroom looks beautiful. Yeah. It's not normally like this.
I mean, you still have the thongs, but it's a start. Might as well be wearing a thong. Stop whining. Yes, ma'am. Early this morning, a private jet, on its way from Washington, D.C., crashed at Burbank Airport.
Supersymmetry says, for every type of particle, say the electron, there's a heavy superpartner. So you have the... and they have really stupid names, unfortunately, called the selectron. You just add an S to the name. The squark. Uh, the sup, the sdown.
What'd you guys do about pussy in Iraq anyway? Did you fuck camels? I was in Afghanistan. And you don't go anywhere near the camels, 'cause sometimes they strap them up with explosives and run them into camp and... And if you try to have sex with the girls there, their village throws rocks at 'em till they die, so there's not a lot going on.
No. "Yet he is but a mask. "'Tis the thing behind the mask." Does the sky look lower to you? The sky?
(whimpers) Â™º helps the medicine go down â™º the medicine go down, the medicine go down â™º â™º Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down â™º â™º in a most delightful way (Blows nose) Â™º aah... This is weird. I'm collecting a sample of the virus to create a vaccine.
Though Davina must realize you owe her as much as she owes you. You never could have banned the witches from using magic without her. She's not exactly besties with them. I'm protecting her. A lot of them would like to get their hands on her and kill her to finish the harvest.
The sooner the better. Sooner is not possible. The only safe time to travel out to the villages is in darkness. Which is not for several hours. Who's hungry?
I don't know. I always thought the best thing about it was you got to look at the West Side. I'm on the third floor. My window faces another window. I just got shown a place on 5th Avenue. High floor, wraparound terrace.
His... He was told to go professional, he didn't listen. Who didn't listen? Your barber? Ha. Let's go.
Why didn't you tell me this? 'Cause I was being protective. Are you immediate family? Umm, no. Then you need to wait outside.
Can't say I'm going to argue with you there. Ah, get it, I got to go. Didn't expect to hear from you. I didn't expect to call, but I found a bug in my office. I'm assuming not a cockroach?
Leslie, permission to leave the corner. Denied. But, look, I did not lose your speech after all. I forgot. I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.
She knew about the tunnels. The King used them to bring his companions in and out of the palace. Seems I'm not the only one who grew tired of his partnership with you. All right, Your Majesty. You're going to help me find the Knave's heart.
