See, paradise. I lost my virginity over here, when I was 26 And ten years ago the tsunami came. No warning. The wave was high as a house.

Why are you interested in that stuff? I thought you said UFOs were a crock. They are. But the fools that chase them can sometimes come up with something interesting. See?
That might just do it. But we need everything to be ready fast. The capacitor is old. It's failing. So all of the work you've been doing is to keep this running?
I don't think we can take this risk. If we stop it now, if we pull the plug, the energy will discharge safely, guaranteed. Everyone will be trapped, including Col. Baird. I think she'd be the first one to make that call. I promised I'd do the right thing.
What kind of stuff did you write? Well, my thesis was all poetry, actually. Can I read some? Oh, I don't have it anymore. My poetry is from a different life.
No offense. I only share spit with my man and my babies. I'll take it. Mother's Day Fair... expanded visitation... it fosters the inmates' connection to the outside world.
I only share spit with my man and my babies. I'll take it. Mother's Day Fair... expanded visitation... it fosters the inmates' connection to the outside world. These women forget they have lives on the outside, it affects how they behave in here.
He couldn't get that close, and then, if he knew the judge, he wouldn't... I mean, he just wouldn't do it. He's radical, but he's not nuts. Let me give you the final tidbit. A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.
Because if I'm not there to speak for the Cardinal, they'll kill him. Cromwell, I am content you are a burgess in the Parliament. My Lord. I spoke to the King for you and he is also content. You will take his instructions in the Commons - and mine.
Do not treat me like a hysterical wife. I am not a hysterical wife! Mo, you want to sit down, and we can talk about Th-- I'm not talking to you anymore, Benjamin Hershel Grossman! And do not call me, 'cause I will not pick up!
You can see that plainly enough in the lost letter technique, which I conceived of at Yale and was refined at Harvard. Leave a letter, a sealed, stamped letter but un-mailed, for someone else to find. Leave it on a sidewalk, inside a store, a phone booth. Put it under the windshield wipers of a parked car with a note saying, "Found near car." All letters are addressed to the same post office box.
Philip, they're here to teach, and you cannot ask them to waste their time. They should go back to their families, move on with their lives instead of being a horrible burden on everyone. Burden? Is it a burden to serve? Is it a burden to help someone in need?
Menti. Why aren't they here? I'll say it. Dear God, before we depart, we ask for thy watchful care. The journey we now feel prompted to take require thy protective hands.
How long does the psychosis last? Who knows? They're all - dead within two days anyway. - Not a very efficient pathogen. Seems to be doing a pretty fair job kicking our ass.
- Let's do this. - Oh, my God. But what do they know? They were taking their shirts off at work. Bow and I were fine.
- Let's do this. - Oh, my God. But what do they know? They were taking their shirts off at work. Bow and I were fine.
Fight to the end. I'm impressed. I wish I could've spent more time with you. I have everything I need from you. I don't understand why you would care so much about these witches.
He didn't deserve it and then he used it against me! What's this now? You're rating people? Yeah, it's that site. Raters.
Heh, heh. I'm famous. Hear that? They say you have powers. What they call me, where you come from? The Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor. You know why they call me that?
Lost four head last night. Whole county will be ruined if that keeps up. You'll figure something out. Darling? But you must remember, such incantations are dangerous. And you must never speak the devil's language idly.
Are you going to fix that yourself? Of course. I'm good with stitching. So, women wear corsets so they don't exert themselves? Partly.
Not for flattery, or... my vanity... or anything under the sun. Now, please... go and take it off. The dress will look fine without it. Thank you. But I'll keep the shoes on if I may.
Good evening, Mr. Talbot. Yes. I have penetrated your fanciful stage name. Ethan Lawrence Talbot. Born the year of our Lord 1857 in the New Mexico Territory, enlisted in the United States Cavalry March the 2nd, 1882. Your complete War Department dossier is currently being ferreted out from thick ledgers in various departmental agencies in Washington.
I'm not going in there. You can't make me. I don't like it here. Well, I'm sorry, Marjorie, but I do. And I like those girls.
I said you were getting too involved with this, didn't I? I said you were getting that look in your eye. Oh, yes - because you're the expert in everything, aren't you, Vikram? Well... it's not me who's been suspended from practise. It's not my code of ethics that's being investigated.
How's Toni? He doesn't even hurt anymore. He has this big scar here. It itches like crazy so... he licks it like a dog. Is he mad at me?
There were new rules now, new reasons for him to call. He made choices and I obeyed. I let him press his thumb so hard into my neck that blue marks appeared. I let him bend my limbs ways they didn't go, and once his arm reared back and his fist landed with a thud on my collar bone, like sex, that didn't feel like anything I thought it would. He moved me where I had to go.
What? Of course you're gonna be sensitive to it. You have a right to be sensitive to it. You're a survivor of abuse. Hannah, I don't know what you're talking about.
You think that's how I wanted to dress five days a week? No, of course not. But no one gets the privilege of being themselves all the time, Carrie. No one. Now, if you want to go in there and upset her, I'm not gonna stop you.
Weddings, bar mitzvahs. You know, this one just specializes in corporate inquiry. Corporate inquiry... truly God's work. Everything's cool, buddy. He's just gonna come in, sit down with the inmates who eat kosher, have a little convo... get to know them.
It's not Trudy's Maple Logs. Yeah, but she has a plate of donuts. I know, but that's so stupid, because what does a maple log know about making donuts? It's like a totally different species. Well, does a donut have a self-awareness of what it means to be a donut that somehow makes it a more capable cook?
You know what? You really need to go fuck yourself. I need your advice. - I want 10% off the top. Your girls are rebelling.
That's Investment Fund Company, isn't it? They are 7 percent share holders of our company. A man named Praveen Shetty has purchased that company. What does he want? That chair.
If Joong-Ki is not here, that means Bak is not ready to... Tan-Wu! You sly old fox. Did I see you at Min-Ji's? Hey, sis, go get us a couple coffees. Come this way.
He was at the mercy of his creative flow. Sounds like you were at the mercy of it as well. I never minded. I just wanted him to feel free to do whatever he needed to do. I respected his process.
I want to leave something more than impressive report cards to remember me by. There is so much beauty in the world. And that's all that matters. Inspiration. Love.
And now you can't take not being close to me? You need to go. - Major... - No, just go, all right? The passionate mind is selfish.
This ball is their way of welcoming us. So clearly there can be no doubt about their loyalties? Actually, it is a bit unclear. Judge Shippen opposed the extension of royal authority, at least where taxation is concerned. But he also opposed last year's Pennsylvania constitution.
You will serve on full pay as a major. And all your debts will be cleared by the Crown. There is a valuable piece of royal property on a ship bound for New York. It is concealed inside a waxwork. - Concealed?
Franklin calls it an armonica. It mechanically recreates the tones made by rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine glass. So he mechanized a parlor trick. Perhaps, but this parlor is testament to the man's genius and industry. Take his lightning rod.
Mrs Grove does like to read the gossip columns. ~ She looks lovely. ~ Oh, that dress! Is it true it comes from Paris? Lady Mae's got a fashion house there.
Not to hear what I was saying, but for the moment when I couldn't go on, when I would shut up. Then she could kill me. I ran to the door. I wanted to slam it behind me and lock it.
You seem very nervous these days. Hummm... So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys.
You re fine. Yes, yes. You re doing just great. Thank you Doctor. Because I can t be sick with my film. I must have caught a cold.
None of you do! We know what needs to be done and we do it. We're the ones who live. You, you just sit and plan and hesitate. You pretend like you know when you don't.
What service? They make me give them oral in exchange for letting me stick around. What's the point of being a virgin anyways? Nobody cares when a guy loses it, but for some reason, it's this huge deal for girls. - Hey, what is that? - Smell of success.
They're closed? Yeah, by order of the Health Department, apparently. - How do you make unhealthy coffee? - Maybe it was the scones. Mm-hm. Heh. Listen, I got some shit in my fridge, like frozen gumbo, toasted waffles, eggs.
Cops investigating cops and making them heroes is why chief Cervantes formed civilian oversight. God, it really is good to see you. She likes you. She just kissed you on your gross, sweaty, hairy cheek. That's not gonna stop her from getting me fired or thrown in jail.
It's regarding a story we're airing on Wednesday night. Thank you. - Matley's here. - Yeah. I would say, based on our available handwriting evidence... yes, this is the same person. This signature on the June 24th document shows some conspicuous differences.
A key that automatically types a raised "th." Critics claim typewriters didn't have that ability in the 1970s, but some did. In fact, other Bush military records released by the White House itself... show the same superscript. Here's one from 1968. Some analysts outside CBS... say they believe the typeface on these memos is New Times Roman... which they claim was not available in the 1970s.
That referred to a piece of information Mike uncovered... working on a documentary for the Germans. A piece of information against the president? I think specifically, it referred to Bush losing his nerve while flying. Which you did not mention in the report you aired on 60 Minutes. I didn't think we had it nailed down.
I agree with him that the Middle East peace is a very... Mary, it's Dan plus three. Well, I'm working on a Chardonnay Xanax cocktail... if it makes you feel any better. Did you know that 60 Minutes was the first news program... to ever make money? Before that, all news divisions operated at a financial loss.
At least I am. Howard, what do you think? Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real. Well said, old chap.
- Here we go. - What are we doing? I am taking you shopping. My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again. Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it's just not really my thing. Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
What? One must have an honest heart, and that you do. Your job is to get Munni home. After that you can tell father anything you want. Afridi is trying to stay on crease.
Let's stay on point. We're talking about the well-being of a man whom we all love very much. There's many factors at play. Spite doesn't have to be one of them. You know what, Howard? I was on the fence till you showed up, but thanks for helping me decide.
That's right. Becomes a mold of the object. You know, if you want, I will show you my workshop later. I just realized that we don't have any wedding rings. It's okay.
What's that smell? It's pigeon shit. I'll go out on a limb and say that you celebrated last night then you blacked out. And your point? Check came in, okay? You showed up at this time yesterday to sign for it.
Something big is definitely going down. I got a plan. You know what? How about you and I spy on that Chinese factory? Yeah, but, Charlie, I trust the Chinese as far as I could throw their factory. Mm-hmm.
What do you want for it? Well, I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of the original price, but, uh... considering the circumstances, I'm open to a reasonable discussion. All right.
I was raised by an archeologist. I recognize the patterns on the hilt. It's a fine example. I'd hardly tiptoe in here as a boy, so sacred was the laird's room. But I'd slip in when he was out at the fields, just to hold it for a few moments.
old-school gun dealer. Kozik's trafficking illegal, untraceable firearms through his custom metal shop on Newcastle. Shipments are getting larger, more frequent, and now come with specialized parts, Including D.I.Y. kits to turn semis into fully automatics. All right, so, this has taken a lot of surveillance, time, and hard work, but we have a search warrant for Kozik's shop and arrest warrants for him and all of his pals. Today's shipment is due at 10:00 A.M.
I wish I could, but I... I-I can't. Crazy. I still can't believe you turned off the backup alarm. You're like a snooze ninja.
Okay, I'm gonna take care of this for you. How? You're suspended. Exactly. I'm not a cop anymore, I don't need a warrant.
We both know that she is dying of the virus. Unless she gets the right medication, she'll soon be dead. You know the problem with buying medicine in this country is that you never know if what you're buying is real... or counterfeit. The doctors assure me that these will have an immediate impact on your mother's health. What do I have to do for them?
¶ I will hold... ¶ ¶ Forever ¶ ¶ Forever. ¶ Mercedes! We have amazing news. Remember that movie that Artie wrote for you but you were too busy on your own world tour so we gave it to me?
ARTIE: Hi! We're here! TINA: Hey, Rachel! Oh, no, don't strain yourself. Please. I've been sweating my boobs off at Tracy Anderson's for the past nine months.
- All right. - Let's get you inside. Jenny... It feels to me that this baby is breech. Well... He's in the wrong position.
They dodge and tiptoe. But I'd rather leave this office having accomplished something of value than secure another four years having done nothing at all. Franklin Delano Roosevelt ushered in an era of hope and progress when he proposed the New Deal. And at the time, his reforms were considered radical. But he once said, "This country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it.
- For what? An article on the dynamic duo? I mean, I may as well have been invisible. Well, I mean, maybe he just wanted our backstory for context. I'm sure the article will be all-inclusive.
Yeah, that's how my cousin died. - Really? - Well, drug overdose. But that's what he thought was happening. Hey, everybody! This is so silly, but my I.D. badge says "Employee"
Yeah, and I agree with her. We all think you're half right. Your childhood enemies are thieves. And arsonists. No, just thieves.
Yeah, she is. I'll let her know. I don't like that look. It's Kevin. You don't owe me anything.
I told you the painting would vanish Zee, I never said to where. So you played me. I protected you. From what?
But that doesn't mean there isn't room for you to love another. That's not the way of my kind. There are rules. For thousands of years, I live by the rules of the Light and the Dark. It's because of that steadfast resolution that I tore my family apart.
- I believe we can do that, sir. Remy, what's the timeline on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds? The Leg office predicts the Senate version will pass in two to three weeks. Working with friendlies in the House. Throw some pork on it, slow it down. That's all the more reason that we need to accelerate.
He's losing too much blood. The X-ray is full. No time for that. What are you doing? I'm gonna use this wire as a probe.
There's virtually no blood loss. And our patient? Pulse is steady. This is the key to the separation. We enter here at the bottom where they're joined, get access to the ligament and clamp it off.
Oh, yes. A scheme to bring two unexpected people together. And I will find happiness in other people's love. Now, who is the target of your arrow, there, Cupid? George and AnnaBeth. Oh, that is preposterous!
We even began to believe God had spared us the worst of it. Then orders came from the King. The village was to be blockaded to prevent the spread of infection. Anyone who tried to escape was shot. Plague villages have to be contained to save other lives.
I thought this day would never come. Expectations are high. Pray God we don't disappoint them. A pleasant change - to see a mine opening! For how long, I wonder?
Thank you, God. How much? It's whatever you want to give. This is a test? No.
Okay, that was fucking hot. I'm not gonna do it. Okay, I'm not gonna end up like my father who, at the end of his life, didn't have a goddamn thing except for a fucking ugly cat, an alienated son and a sticky bun stuck to the side of his face. No, you know what? This is what we're gonna do, Kelsey.
Whole. I just wanted a good picture in my head... before R'yo slits me open from throat to crotch. Look at me. R'yo moved orbits and tides because she loves you and wants you with her again. She doesn't care about me.
- Baby O'Riley! - Ah! Sven! It's been so long. - Riley, it's good to see you. - You, too. How's the boat?
- Ah! Sven! It's been so long. - Riley, it's good to see you. - You, too. How's the boat? Uh, it creaks, it groans.
This is your home, after all. Born right there. Ellen and I still laugh about that night. Gunnar won't let me buy a new phone. - He calls it the umbilicus.
You're here to help them. Over the millennia, they have gathered vast resources that could help you in your hunt. A legend has passed down through the centuries... concerning a book, an ancient tome of uncertain provenance and some say divine inspiration; the Occido Lumen. And, uh... what do you know of this book?
The biological and chemical components, that's more your department. If we can brew up something that will burn through these things fast but not too fast, with enough incubation time to spread the disease to other vampires, then... Perhaps you two can be useful after all. I'm glad you approve. But first, I, uh... I must ask you to help me with something.
I was getting worried. Did everything go okay? At dinner last night... do you believe those things you said about me? Of course I do. Yes, I left some details out.
Yeah, sure, take the day. Go shopping, whatever makes you feel better. Thank you for your understanding. Enjoy your coffee. You got any issues need taken care of?
How hot is this girl, man? You know what, never mind. Hey... -How's it going? -Good. Can I help you with something? Yeah, I think something's wrong with my car.
Okay. You said we were gonna paint. We are. Just a quick stop at Dr. Richardson's. I thought you were okay.
Focus is the most important thing any of us can do. You... You are losing focus, Jack. I have refocused. Forced retirement at the FBI?
I'd shake your hand, but... I'm going to hold off on any reciprocation for the moment, but thank you. And you're funny. That's your gift. I brought you something. The Vanishing.
Maybe he's violent and she's scared. Wait, wait, wait. What? Maybe you're on the fast bus to crazy town, man. Tyler is a good kid. He's got, like, a tiny criminal record.
They need a heartbeat. What did you do to me? Hope's blood is now in you. You are now the bait. And this body is still linked to Davina and those children.
Mark my words. By day's end, they will be laid low, and my daughter will be safe with us. Listen, Davina. The rite of supplication is just a formality. You meet the elders and you show a little bit of respect... what happened to you just telling them I'm gonna be regent?
Minx... she's talking back, sneaking out of the house, doing things that... What if she's turning into one of those kids? You know, the ones we whisper about, the ones you make up excuses to keep your kid away from. Do you remember why I asked for that therapist's number? The imaginary-friend thing.
Lieutenant Backstrom, Assistant District Attorney Steven Kines. We met at the... I know who you are, heinz. Why are you here?
- Closets. - Closets? - Never mind. - Okay. So I did a comprehensive analysis on the poison.
He kept calling me a white bitch. You white bitch! Kept saying, "white bitch, white bitch, you white bitch." Evidence has now surfaced that shows, on multiple occasions, the accused has committed assaults with the specific purpose of intimidating and terrorizing his victims based on their membership to an ethnic group. We now believe, without question, Carter Nix targeted Matt and Gwen Skokie and entered their home with the intent to cause bodily harm because of their race.
Kevin, who is it? Detective Dyson. Oh, you know him? I was assigned to your case. I thought I'd check in.
When will I learn. You looking for something? Give. Your monster killed one of my doctors. And now you have the nerve to come in here and try and steal my work?
Your monster killed one of my doctors. And now you have the nerve to come in here and try and steal my work? When that thing finds us, it's going to eat you both alive and then use me as a toothpick. Because I'm the skinniest. We are done taking shots in the dark here, Evony.
Or all the other people you've helped. And what about the people I've gotten hurt? What do I... What do I tell them? Feel my heart. Come on, feel it.
- You know what? Drop the whole "noble thug" shtick. You're covering your own ass and you know it. You-- you have a choice right now. To recognize that you are a promising young college student, not some ghetto outlaw.
- With my witness? Yeah, somebody called and said that she might not be reliable, so we just wanted an impartial take. Impartial my ass. You know, you two... you like to get your hands all over everything, don't you? This is bullshit.
I will no longer see the sun nor stars, or feel the winds play upon my cheeks. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exalt in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away. My ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace.
He's a cold son of a bitch, I'll tell you that much. When you told us to go back to the resort, they came back with us, but Aiden was so shook up, he couldn't drive, so Hank drove instead. 'We'd only just left the beach. 'Nobody was talking, we were just all in shock. Couldn't believe it.
The good news is you never violated the infidelity clause. But Julian did. Unfortunately, it only pertained to you. Pursuant to the codicil, paragraph three, Mr. Voorhees retained the right to... "stick it wherever."
- What's wrong with him? - We're gonna find out. L-let's give him steroids, and add an antiviral. You got it. Could it be something he picked up in a foreign country?
They are so good. Boy, the highlight of a very complicated childhood. I'll say, those damn aliens ain't gonna take these from my cold, dead hands. I broke into a lockbox. Found the keys to our truck out back.
Thank goodness nothing bad happened to you. Wouldn't want you to have to stay in there forever. Raina ... she was unrecognizable. It was insane, and not just from the outside. Look ... we separated her DNA and mapped it using gel electrophoresis.
- No. That's inhuman. I thought the readings were a mistake, that I put the thing together wrong. Been struggling to, uh, um... something's wrong with the data in my head. - What are you saying?
Here, we had to shut them down. This faction had built a city. They brought with them the Diviners, which hold the crystals. Their plans were discovered and thwarted by the better of my kind, putting an end to that dark chapter of our past. Until now.
Leaving Skye with us is the logical choice, I promise. No. No, that is not what I mean. Asgard is millennia beyond you in our pursuit of science, of knowledge, and we have learned there are some things that can never be understood. Is this little talk one of them?
I trusted her. She said she would hide me, but she lied. She was gonna give me to the cops. Do you trust me? Did you kill Bug?
Are you sure about this? It's our last chance. Mr. Whitley was unsuccessful. Foster refuses to help. We're running out of time to retrieve Mr. Cole.
It's organized. They said they found a cure for the plague. There is no way to predict the mutation. Foster's got a room full of computers. That's why they need their core.
We're not gonna have any power left. I can undo all this... put things back the way they're supposed to be. These people... they depend on me. I got to look out for their future. There is no future.
Violent roleplay? No, nothing like that. ~ Did your husband use pornography? ~ No. Apart from one time his mate gave him a DVD. We watched it together and we mostly laughed through it.
- I think it's... - It's the Dybbuk. This is Rabbi Ezra. He's the one who took the photo. Rabbi, what... what is this dybbuk?
How many cocks are in this box? ! That's a messed up guessing game. 14? I'm fine, I landed on bubble wrap. Where's Erica?
Turns out, it disappeared from county evidence last year, but was never reported. If I were Sheriff Hudson, I'd be looking into the chief suspect's whereabouts around the time the mask went missing. But even then, what's Seth Branson's, or rather Seth Palmer's, connection to Brandon James? Why become the monster behind the mask? We found this knife in your classroom.
I'm not playing, Brian. Gauze. It's the pitch in your voice, your tone, maybe it's your face. - What? - It's mean.
That she was telepathically compelled to kill her own parents? It's unprecedented, to say the least. As was the city being attacked by aliens, but it happened. Buildings were destroyed, people were killed. Perhaps what happened to Hope has happened before.
It's not about you. It's about everyone else. Damn, this salt is heavy. Plowman ain't paying me enough for this crap. Once the solution mixes with the pulverized meteor sample inside the centrifuge, the Genesis Element should be in its purest form for collection.
Plowman Family Farms is proud to present to the world... the greatest agricultural breakthrough in a century. Tomorrow, at farms all across the drought-stricken Central Valley, we launch a cutting-edge, new rainmaking system... One that not only seeds clouds but also fortifies them with a nutrient-rich water source we call... Smart Rain. The tree in your vision...
You take out everything? - Yes all. Everything must be clean. No, not the pants. Keep it.
For that we will have to change that. A head, body and soul. Germany must know: Highway was not designed by a moron! No, it was the Führer.
He has a fleet of limousines and cars for an executive transport service business type thing or what not, and he leased a car to Mr. Mosley. Now Mr. Ryan says that Mr. Mosley actually had access to his garage so that he could pick up and return a Cadillac, which is probably how he gained access to the main house, and why he knew the Ryans were on vacation in Cancún. But I assume he won't be working as a driver anymore. They could press more serious charges if they wanted. Um, the dog is what I'm concerned with.
You'll get used to it. Youse must be the Morgans. Yes. I'm Henry, and this is my wife, Abigail. The radiator's acting up.
I was just going over the body. Lucas noted fractures in the right clavicle and radius. His theory, that along with the fatal blow, that these injures were sustained during the fracas. And what do you think? Well, looking at her wrist under magnification, it appears that her bone was moved back into alignment.
That's every detail. Tell it again. I knocked up a cocktail waitress when I was 23. She had the kid but said I couldn't see him because I was an irresponsible douche bag. Love that part.
I will fight you forever. No, please, please do not do this. I have asked you respectfully for safe passage. You are obliged to take my message to the council. I see you like to use potassium chlorate.
What service do you have? Send, damn you. Send, damn you. Come on! Oh. Come on!
- He knows what he's doing to this family? - Germ? N. Do not allow yourself? to nobody to insult and accuse my children. The? clear? I do not want to insult anyone.
You can't be sure of that. Alan Fitch did not think so. Whether he is or not, it's a moot point. He needs to be eliminated. This prison of yours, The Factory, I understand the American public is unaware of its existence.
I'll pick up a bottle of wine or, you know, whatever for you, and we can divvy up the rest when I get back. What the hell, Maria? You shouldn't have taken that bastard's money. Why wouldn't I? Because we didn't finish the job.
And with his unmatched supply of fine wines, he has single-handedly shaped the PGS into the envy of every wine club in the world. If they love him that much, they can't know the wine's fake. - Well, he didn't seem to, either. - How is that possible? Well, for one, the wine is too valuable to open.
It's in everyone's best interest if the Company doesn't hear about the weapons. Yeah, well, lucky for you, unless there's a warrant involved, I don't give a shit about you, The Company or your doomed- to-fail resistance. So you'll keep your mouth shut? If you put enough beer in it. John, it feels... wet.
Otherwise known as the giant desert hairy scorpion. Nick found a piece of the molted exoskeleton next to Pete Corday's body in the restroom. You were able to trace it? Unfortunately no. The giant desert hairy scorpion is quite common in Nevada.
John, we've talked about this. I've already got a job. I'm not asking you to just join the team. I'm asking you to run it. You want me to take over the crime lab in San Diego?
- Boy, we're on urgent business. We're seeking a book. TheOccidoLumen. Do you know of it? - Mother Superior said it was cursed.

Everyone's like him? I cross-referenced his blood against Bertrise's. Natural immunity, as it turns out, is a tad more common than I initially thought. Anywhere between 1% and 5% of the global population. That's how they took Europe.
So it turns out that the murder weapon is not the only knife made from Lucas Reem's bones. Rumored to be eight of them out there. Any idea who has them? No, but there is a user who is trying to track them down. He goes by the name of DesertSky60, and he has spent the last month asking about those knives.
Isn't that Russian for "friend of Putin"? We immediately tapped his cellphone, and he captured this exchange. _ _ Like all good citizens,
Shaw's wounded. And Winthrop and Briscoe are dead, I think. Let's roll, boys. Check the back. Briscoe's dead.
But turning my back on her in that moment Just didn't seem right. Is it safe? Can we take it with us? that stuff jumped out of that capsule, Hit that rat in a second, and it was dead instantly. And this is test subject number two.
You're a man of internal frustration, born of common blood, who's all but ruled the kingdom... yet forced to remain in the shadows while sons are born. Except now there is no heir. Instead there's opportunity. This... opportunity... would secure your position as well before others take it from us both. I wouldn't claim your heart, my lady.
I no longer seek wanton carnage, Mother. I've found my path. To bring back our kind. Our kind? You mean the Awakening Ritual.
I should've let you die! And this time, I will. Katrina! Katrina! Come on.
Mike doesn't know he's not the father. Who is the father? There were a few one-night stands. I'm not proud of it. What's wrong with my baby?
Who is the father? There were a few one-night stands. I'm not proud of it. What's wrong with my baby? It's... it-it's like it's carrying a virus.
Certainly. One Euclid, Taylor's nerve center. On the outside, a nondescript office building. Inside... more security than Fort Knox. If we're smart and very lucky, here's how we might get in.
It got in the way of my partying. So, you know, it was a Sophie's choice, but I feel like I made the right call. And Tom, I make it a point to cry for at least 20 minutes a day. - On purpose? - Yes, Sam Malone.
I mean, she's a lady, you know? Probably descended from royalty or something, and my ancestors are all bookies out of Phoenix. Hey, you hold your head high, okay? 'Cause in Phoenix, the bookies are royalty. Tom. You know, Judy and I were just talking about the time we had a raccoon in the vents, and we were wondering, how did that raccoon get in there?
You're gonna tell me all these ladies go to the same church? Justine Simmons didn't go back to church looking for forgiveness, she went back looking for clients. You know, maybe Alana was right, you know? We should, uh, talk to her father again. This piece of tissue Dr. Hodgins found is from the victim's scalp.
Thank you. Your acne really cleared up. It actually migrated to my butt, but thank you. Oh, I actually saw the inside of your apartment in Architectural Digest. They always have it in my psychic's waiting room.
I had had enough. Kyle and I began arguing so much. I left. Do you have a dog? Oh, no.
This is the photo taken by the Navy SEAL team when they rescued Sarah Goode. Yep, this printer could do the job, and it can be purchased for just a couple thousand dollars. I disassembled the gun, and it's really quite simple. All the elements are made of plastic, including the springs. I can't believe those parts came out of a printer.
Do you need a tissue? It's the serum. She means I'm dying. I only wish it had the same effect on Liam. I don't know why he's not dying, too. Did Julianna use the same serum on him?
♪ It's not your fault that I can't use words ♪ - So I wasn't queen. - So what? I was still glad to be there. Mom was right.
- if they're all right! - That's not why we're here! We need your help to blow up a train. There's three u-boat outposts on the coast, all supplied by a train which runs through St. Antoine. - It's due sometime in the next few days. - They're carrying T3 torpedoes, enough to supply u-boat operations for three weeks.
- It's the only way. I have looked over the contract between Mr. Appleby and Mr. Lindo. Mr. Lindo, you may take your property. She's not my property. I wish for Meena to be free.
- Ah! - That's him. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come in. Hello, girls. Which sink is clogged?
I know what you were doing last night, pretending to help your friend to get to me. Well, that's not exactly what happened. Don't apologize. I like a bad boy. I did have a leather jacket in junior high.
Wallis went off to self-medicate, got caught in a bad situation. What do you think? I think the guy over at that pickup has been watching us since we got out here. What guy? There was a guy.
Now we're all immune, asshole. Well, if it isn't Mr. president, gone all Navy blue. You're not still blubbering over your poor children, are you? I'm gonna spell it out for you, Kevin. The more people we save, the more your men will realize immunes aren't so special anymore.
Right, I see it. I'm behind it. This is what I need you to do, Kalinda. You see the light up ahead? Stop at it.
I know what they do to guys like me in the big house. D Block prom queen. That's it? It's gone? It's still there.
It's still there. I hacked the icon and changed its color so it blends in with the background of the ATC monitor. Basically, I made it disappear. Sudie. That's Lithuanian for "sayonara," which is Japanese for "good-bye."
The Emperor has discussed Mary with his own councillors. He'd like her married to his own relatives. I will in no wise suffer her to leave this country, until her behaviour to me is as it should be. Myself... I'd go up-country - and if she would not sign the oath,
Won't do you any good. How do you know that? How do you know that, huh? ! You never pay attention to anything! 'Cause I read the security manual... First thing I do in any building.
Maybe you can have his leftovers. We both know that's not gonna happen. No dinner meant no dinner. I didn't come down here for food. I'm down here for... the crisper drawer.
Okay. We raise. What do you think, Burk? Do I have the goods? And what am I looking at here? This is the vaccine compound before nebulization, and here it is after it's been sprayed into the air.
And I don't want to hurt anyone. Something's changed. And I think it's because of me. And I don't know how to fix it. My asthma is back.
Precisely. Exotic matter, transdimensional energy will theoretically leak from one universe into another. Now, if this breach Mr. Garrick's talking about is real, if there is indeed a hole in our universe which leads to his earth... We can make some adjustments and upload an electrophotography program to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite and essentially photograph the exotic matter leak. Thereby giving us the locale of said breach.
You're behaving weirdly today. You seem irritated and out of balance. I've had a really shitty day, okay? Because you didn't see your family? No, that's not why.
We will continue to protect and share. Do you think it is better to repair the system or change it? We can not sustain unlimited economic growth on a finite planet. Infinite growth is not sustainable in a finite world. So this system can not continue indefinitely.
Say it with your mind. Welcome to Valhalla, my ladies. No, wait! Wait! There's nothing to fear, strange maiden. We are Odin's chosen.
Get away from me! Get away! No! - Please tell me you have the camera. - What's wrong?
If it isn't my old buddy Malick. From outside the dome. Tell me about the egg. Egg? Oh, you, oh, you mean the egg that I gave you after you promised my family would get out?
I know how weird that sounds. What we had... that felt just as real to me as it did to you. I mean, the baby, us. Did you take the test? I haven't looked at it yet.
We got to put her down before that thing comes out. Why is that your solution to everything? Killing the problem. I'm sure you like stepping on spiders too. Well, if the spider has a queen baby inside that's gonna wipe out the entire human race, that kind of spider, yeah, I think I'd kill it.
Kill them. Hey, don't shoot! Stop! Don't shoot my son! I think we just found our test subject.
How excited am I? I'm crazy excited. Are you kidding me? Skye, I don't want to embarrass you too much, but... y'all, I'm sorry. I am the "Oh, gee, Skye Summers" fan. And-and her first CD was the very first CD I ever bought.
There's no listing for a Petty Officer Daniel Harvey anywhere in the Navy's record. Someone needs to tell him that. Abby examined the I.D. If it's a forgery, it's a really good one. And no hits on his prints.
Abby examined the I.D. If it's a forgery, it's a really good one. And no hits on his prints. Vehicle's legit-- it's registered to the Department of Defense's motor pool. Who checked it out?
"this is stupid." He would do things very much out in the public. Very much in the face of law enforcement. But on February 14th, 1929, Capone goes too far, ordering the brutal execution of rival Chicago gangsters. More than 150 shots are fired, in what becomes known as one of the bloodiest days in Mafia history, the Saint Valentine's day massacre.
Walked out covered in mozzie bites, saying he'd just been in a hotel. The man, identified as David Burton... I made you a grilled cheese. Jill texted you. You went through my phone?
I feel like I was sitting on the toilet the last time I met you. That is crazy. No, that's déjà vu. That's the mind taking an event you're experiencing in the present moment and mistaking it for a memory. The mind.
Please. Luke, what are you doing here? What happened? Uh, nothing. Uh, I - I-I fell.
They want to see you as one of them. I'm the Queen of England. You are now, but once upon a time, you were simply a young girl who placed the duties of her family before her own heart's desire. Eventually, your heart got the better of you and you slipped. I was married to the King by then - and we had a son.
So this scar is a constant reminder of how fragile life is. And how fragile my parents thought I was. Well, I think that you have proven them wrong several times over. Dr. Barmal killed herself to stop the virus spreading, right? She assumed the virus would die with her.
There's Defense, Homeland, CIA, the Bureau on this list. It's gonna be hard to narrow it down. Yeah, so much for the good old days where you could just look for the glint of a sniper-rifle scope in a nearby window. What does it do, this virus, to the body? The CDC's still breaking it down.
I know a train that magnetically levitates is inherently cool, but still, the color's kinda bumming me out. Let's paint blue streaks. And while we're at it, it needs to go 500 kilometers an hour. We've been working for three years, you know, to push it to 450. The test is in six days.
Isn't the tone kind of... A little nasty? (KARA GASPS) Uh, I mean, the headline. Um, okay. "Millennial Falcon.

I just wanted to call and say I met with a big-money guy. It went really well. Get ready, downtown L.A., 'cause, uh, um... I got to go, honey. Love you.
I don't understand. Why... why... why wouldn't he answer his phone? I don't understand why my little girl... I don't... You drop an egg.
If it goes viral, this could be a game changer. Fun! Every great Ed Talk has this moment that is so mind-blowing, the entire audience gasps. I don't only have that, but I have a killer opening joke. Check it.
Fun! Every great Ed Talk has this moment that is so mind-blowing, the entire audience gasps. I don't only have that, but I have a killer opening joke. Check it. Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?
Let me see. But just for a brief mo. So, as our lives become easier, the computers doing our jobs will be the ones who'll need therapy. And thanks to my algorithm, they'll be able to get it. Reminds me of a joke.

Your mom got the e-mail, right? The memo about side boob and backless gowns? - They send that out every year. - No. This was just sent to our parents.
"Her"? A body. First body I ever saw. Her throat had been slit, and those same symbols were carved into her forehead and her cheeks. I touched her arm.
Oh, if the Monsters find out we put Twizz in protective custody... Get a warrant. I want to do a very public search of his house. A moving truck might help sell it. Ooh, that's a good idea.
You can set the timer to vacuum on a schedule. Is this a subtle hint? You want me to get you one of these for your birthday? Yes, please. No. Actually, my point is this new model, it has memory.
You guys weren't there. 19... 20... 15... I smoke. I think there's something wrong with my gun. Damn it!
The bread knife was expensive. I don't wanna ruin it. Oye, Tío. Ese mi amigo. What are you gonna do to Ash, huh?
This is my assignment. If he tries anything with her, he'll know Raina's not me and he will kill her! Please. You have to let me go. Alex.
You tried to trick my body into giving birth before my C-section. Booze? Sex? Danny, you used all my favorite things against me! Look, Min, if you have this baby safe and naturally, you'll be glad you did.
He's primed and ready. How's your back hand? Guess you can write me a check. Well, it wasn't really a fair fight, now, was it? Even with a head start, a 40-year-old car against a bike made for street racing?
Until you look at this picture and say, "this is my sister." After that, we have to notify your mother. I gotta go. It's your move, kid. [ Sighs ] So...
When they took... my blood at the police station, they must have injected me at the same time. The... The virus can't... can't survive outside the body. They must have, um... They must have kept it heated?
Come with me. 40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance. Huh? I learned how to change the distance between atoms. That's what powers the suit.

You know, they wouldn't let me have breakfast for some reason. Andy, I'll serve. I'm sure you'd like a bit of everything. Bring it on. So, where's this clot?
♪ The greenback boogie ♪ Don't tell me he wasn't in here either. He was in here, all right. What happened? Did the settlement fall through?
Well you look like you still have some large capable teeth. That's great news. How often would you say you floss? This simple daily ritual can add years of happiness and productivity. A healthy mouth is a healthy life.
Sure thing. Nothing worse than a blabber mouth that won't shut up. It's kinda like back in the before. I had this brother in law Does this thing actually run?
- All right, man, see you later. - Later, bro. Let's show everybody the real you. The Shard of Anubis? That's a pretty fancy name.
I guess we'll see how that plays out. I guess we will. Whilst your Federal Bureau is well-equipped to aid us in tracking Mr. Meyers, once captured, we have no idea how to undo the effects - of that blade. - Yeah. I had the same thought, so I went back to this. The timeline for the Ripper killings throughout history.
It all tracks. The end of every killing spree coincides with an outbreak of disease. Yellow fever, cholera, malaria, Spanish flu. Exsanguinated bodies. The knife gains power by draining the blood of its victims.
No one leaves! Brenda, next case. Your Honor, perhaps a short recess before you hear opening arguments? Don't tell me how to run my courtroom! Proceed.
He was like me. He hunted monsters. And with all this talk, I thought it was time to revive a family tradition. Prove that Spring Heeled Jack weren't to blame and catch the real killer. Don't know if I've got what it takes, though. Especially after seeing him in action. So, do you know who the real killer is?
Yeah, but, like, you know, it's such a great place. - I mean, the motto is "Live, Work, Play." - We have a motto? - Yes, on the Web site. - We have a Web site?
It's called a contract. A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment Is the property of our client. Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable. It is unless I woke up in russia this morning. Your honor, I have here a copy Of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.
It is unless I woke up in russia this morning. Your honor, I have here a copy Of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate. She may have signed that contract, But it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time. Your honor, I know this man, And that document could have come from anywhere. Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.
Congratulations. You've just unlocked every man's true motivation in life. Let me give you some advice. Stop treating Lily like some prize to be won. Spoken like somebody's who's never been fought over.
Lily, a bourbon, please. I took this out for a special occasion today, but in the process, I discovered quite a bit of money missing from my bureau. You would not know anything about that? No. Stefan, have you been rummaging around your father's bureau?
The stolen computers have got to be at least a mile away. So that would tell us if they were closer? It's a cell phone tower simulator. It sucks up every signal in a ten-block radius. When DARPA funds classified research, the grant recipients have to use DARPA computers.
First one. That's comforting. Dr. Hudson has done more than most. He did a surgical residency before he moved to E.R. Opening the pericardium now.
I'm Dr. Edward Darius. I'm... Whoever you think you are, you have zero authority in here. I play racquetball with Ed Harbert, C.E.O. of this hospital. Did you know only 1% of all males can perform auto-fellatio?
Well, the blows to your head have created a serious problem. Darius said he's got medicine. The medication will mitigate it, yeah. All right. So, can I get out of here now?
Why are you acting like this? You're a slag. He's like Jekyll and Hyde. One minute, he's this sweet guy, the next minute, he's calling me a slag. I shouldn't have kissed him, that doesn't give him the right to treat me like dirt.
What are you... Behind the car! All right. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm and take your seats. Now what? Now... I apologize.
Domino was her nickname. The day she died, she was competing in a showjumping event. Yes. She rode home to give the horse a cool down. My father was waiting for her.
If they have to prove their devotion at each step, they'll grow more and more indoctrinated along the way. He's brainwashing them. And if they're required to physically hurt themselves this early on, imagine what they'll be required to do when they reach the end. I found additional blood at the gravestone. It was dried.
Machines know what people watch, what people read, what people buy, even what people feel. And now, they can tell us which people are a risk to public safety. Now, to be clear, this is not Precrime. The Hawk-Eye algorithm can't predict exact behavior.
I helped him. Zac was lost without me. He would hyper-focus on one thing and ignore everyone and everything else. He was constantly losing his keys, his wallet, phone. You know where his phone is?
To generous expense accounts. So, any progress with Beckett? You know, at the prison, we, um, sort of had a moment. Really? I think my plan is working.

Actually, it's not your garbage anymore, not once you put it out here. Can I ask why the FBI is looking through my trash? I'm sure you already know this. Police found fingerprints from a guy named Arthur Maciel at the scene of your client's murder. They arrested him, but, interestingly, someone else's DNA was found under Paul Wilkerman's fingernails.
Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. I hope so. What else can you do? Move back in with him? No, of course not.
Sag Harbor. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I remember that weekend.
They we have to hope it's not corroded. There has to be something you can do. So when... when humans breathe, they inhale dust and pollen and other airborne microbes from the environment, right? So where they have been determines what's in their lungs. That TV is like a living organism.
And they, uh, stick to the fan blades. Oh, there you are. Okay, all right. So... so after we sequence the DNA from this specimen, we can run it through the index of airborne microbes-- it's a nationwide database of where bacteria resides. Our target dropped of that TV.
You notice how he's always rubbing his shoulder? [Chuckles] Dude, you're ripped. We get it. "Oh, look at me, I have discernible shoulders.
You know, and truthfully, I know exactly what's going on with Megan. There is a process to life that ends in an unknown. Toby. What?
Just give her some time. We gotta go back through Schultz and Garrigan's bodycam footage, see what else we can find. You got it. Just FYI, it's a lot of footage. I'll round up as many eyes as possible to help.
What's the matter now? Killing whales? Drilling for oil? Child labor? 'Cause let me tell you something.
Bumpy and I go way back. "Bumpy"? Why "Bumpy"? Morning, Angela. Tell me about the accident.
Unusual way to arrange your couches, Gail. All focused on a wall with one single painting on it. But that painting doesn't sit flush against the wall, does it? It's always bothered me, but I let it go. I suppose for fear of... what it meant.
And if it's not, then you're just afraid that the truth will wreck your image. Chuck, we're done here. (phone buzzing) They've got absolutely no case. See, Mr. Peters is being paid by the record company, so let me give you the facts of life straight up, Chuck. Rap on, lawyer lady.
She spoke about it candidly. Look... Officer Reagan came in, over my objection, because he wanted to proffer and clear up the record as soon as possible. Then let's be clear. The process has been working well for Officer Reagan and his family for a long time.
You can undo what you've done? How? Rape's a serious charge, and even with those charges dropped, a cloud is gonna hang over him. Tell me something I don't know. Well, the spotlight that shined on Guerrero could be turned on this accuser.
The Curiel syndicate recently set up shop in Florida. Except it looks like these two were meant to vanish without anyone the wiser. How is that a message? Well, cartels have also been known to use murder as a form of voodoo. In 1989, a university of Texas student was murdered by a satanic gang while on spring break.
I went with my parents to visit an uncle who was living in a nursing home. I got lost for a minute. I went into the wrong room by mistake. I thought it was my uncle, but...it wasn't. He was terrible-looking.
are we chasing a ghost? More like a virtual identity created by a hacker. It's frighteningly easy to register a Social Security number, a birth certificate, even medical records... all in the name of someone who doesn't even exist. A hacker "gives birth" to a shelf baby, then waits-- in real time-- while it "grows up." Then, when the shelf baby turns 16, the hacker gives it a driver's license.
Yeah, that's what I said. Yeah? You're a genius. You shut... Wait, what?

The de-evolution ray is primed, but there is only enough energy for a single shot. Not if we aim at the sky. Yes, of course. The Galacian Wall. The beam will reflect off the inner surface of the energy shield and bathe the entire hemisphere.

Cool stuff happens in a headquarters. Oh. __ Can I call it an office and you call it a headquarters? Yeah, Naz, you can call it whatever you want in the privacy of your own thoughts.

I think there will be an adjustment period after it takes over, - but eventually... - Wait, I'm sorry to interrupt. Um, what do you mean by "takes over"? The singularity.
So just talk to me. I mean, I don't have much in the bank, but you know damn well that Pippy... Stashes after she cashes. Yes, we know. And can we stop with the third person?
W-w-w-where are you going? Rosie, you sure about this? Yep. Your search found two missing persons... Jennifer Lee and Roger Jones. Turns out Roger had a defibrillator implanted two months ago.
You're very attractive, and I very much have a penis. But just being with you is enough. Honest. But being with zombie me is different than being with old me. It's not just no sex.
Okay. I can see that. But... Well, she's just getting a bit intense, you know, okay... I mean, she told me we're celebrating Guy Fawkes Day tomorrow.
Women are more thoughtful than men. It's Christmas, she cares about you. At the very least, you should have backup plan. Like what? The emergency gift.
So, I studied physics. Got a PhD, got a lot of funding... .. for a research project. Things were going really well. I'd been doing some research into parallel universes and how a person might jump into one. So I built this crude prototype... which, er, didn't work.
Yes? - Where is the proof? - I gave it to you. It proves it. No, because however intuitively obvious it may seem, when subject to calculation, it fails.
Millions perished, only to rise again as legions of implacable undead. So certain did it seem the end of days had come that even the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are said to have ascended from Hell. To protect the living, the Grand Barrier was built, a 100-foot wall encircling London. Then excavation began on the Royal Canal, a vast moat 30 fathoms deep surrounding both the city and its walls. The land twixt the two fortifications - became known as The In-Between. - The In-Between.

Someone's at the door, babe. - They can wait. - No, get it, I have to pee anyway. - Everything go okay? - She did great, Brayden.
- Are you saying there's a difference? If someone communicates or travels from one membrane to another, that which makes it human remains intact. Anybody that's familiar with Niels Bohr would know that. - Of course. - We found that by using a combination of stimuli, we can mimic the moment of death in the human brain.
You get her out of here, and you get yourself to bed. You're too sick to be in here. 36500, Station Chatham, proceed over the bar. I repeat, proceed. Once over, travel directly south.
You've already been accounted for. Our work belongs to the Elders. This is their finest hour. You lied to me. I've always known that in your heart you're a scientist first, templar second.
How many times I got to tell you to keep your foot up underneath you? Come on, now. Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head. Teddy... Expect more from you, son.
You see, because like you, I share a very deep connection with my father. And like you, I'll stop at nothing to avenge any wrongs done to him. You know the only difference between your father and mine? Mine's still alive. Get him up. So, this is the man who spent a lifetime plotting against me.
You live upstairs? Uh, yeah, Simon's place. Oh, that's cool. You gotta love Inwood, right? Neighborhood is sketchy, but the price is right.
- Yeah, she's right. Come on. - Come on, guys. [Ruby] Hayward? I really hope this audience gets to see you guys dance.
I'll see you later, good luck, good bye. Rose: Can you walk Joey? And what would be the point of that, sweetheart? He needs to get out, it's healthy. That dog ain't healthy.
And what's with the cage? Uh, this is for uncle Mike's cat. Oh my god, I love cats. That cage is for a cat? That cat must be fat as shit.
Turner: Fuck, goddammit. Remember, your worst quality, can also be your best, okay? Promise me something, Jack. Don't be afraid. If the werewolf in you eats me, that doesn't make it evil.
Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Too much independent spirit for you? Uh, no, I just don't really like bashing my country.
- Help us. Please. This is the interesting stage, the hibernation stage. Kinda like suspended animation. Comatose, unresponsive. The heart eventually stops, or so we thought.

Six! - Seven! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jesus Christ! One at a time! You took the Lord's name in vain. No, I didn't, Janet.
I can't bite it open. Bad teeth. Let me try. Give it. What are you doing? Are you a dog?
Do their ships not fall off at the edge of the sea? Only those who have travelled, would know. And they are from Bukhara - the faraway lands in the cold North. But what is this strange creature they bring with them? Does it give milk?
So you know my name. Why am I here? Because you and your buddy Dr. Stockman found something of mine. The teleportation device. The teleport was supposed to break me out of prison.
I'm really sorry. I think you're trying to tell me something. I'm listening. Talk to me again, okay? Well, this is definitely a good place to hide.
Do you have any I-9's? I'm all out. Thanks. Here... I need you to sign this NDA.
I'm sorry, but how on earth? You had a chance to review or no? You were at the precinct when they brought him in. That's how it happened, isn't it? He's a sweet kid, actually, soft-spoken, sincere. Cool.


- Always have. It's like we used to say when we had to get married and live with your mum and dad. - "Let's look at what we've got. " BOTH: - "Not what we've not got. " Give us a kiss, Rhoda. And that's your lot! Should've said that to you nine months ago!
You said yourself she's probably just as damaged on the inside. Who knows how much she'll suffer? Even if she only lives an hour. Come in. I made you some tea.
The L.A. Times reached out to me today about us, and I thought I'd discuss it with you because they may be calling. They've called. You talked to them? I told them I'd call them back, after I got my recollections together. Funny thing is, I was gonna call you anyway.
This is insane. You couldn't get away with this plot twist in an airport paperback. So... what should we do? Chris, I've been thinking about this constantly. The problem is, it's too risky.
Good-bye, khaleesi. Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal. You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.

We have no time to waste. What are you? This is what I saw in my vision on a stained-glass window. Do you recognize it? Doesn't the codex have a map or something?
Fine! How did I get into this? Keep asking that question. I hope you figure it out. What does that mean? Your body won't last long.
To hell with high society! You know, you're exactly the same. You haven't changed a bit! Do you think so? In myself, I believe I've changed a great deal and for the better. I heard about your marriage.
No one ever buys books, let alone poetry. What you need to do is study, get a diploma, and a teacher position, like me. Do not compromise your future, Alejandro! Butterflies must not turn into flies, nor poets in professors. I am a teacher, and I do not turn into a fly.
I think it's coming from your drawer. Oh, you just hung up on a friend of ours. This isn't my phone. I swear, I've never seen this before. - You might want to use it to call a lawyer.
I mean, what? Is there a problem? Well, uh, might not some parties... the opposing counsel, for example... see this differential and conclude that there may have been some solicitation involved? I did not solicit. I'm just wondering how you account for your success.
They know. Every line starting with 7700 has been rerouted to the bullpen, plus your office. All the assistants know to keep them open. So, if you're on a call and another call comes in, the call doesn't go to an answering machine, right? Because... very important... old people don't like talking to robots.
[Sighs] Omar... that whole, uh, letter-of-resignation thing that... I didn't mean that, not a word. I... [Sighs] I-I'm so incredibly stressed out. I'm stressed out the wazoo.
You know, met with Paige and Kevin, interviewed some paralegals... and, uh, this. KIM: What about you? [Sighs] Finished the commercial.
No, dude, what I do is art. And you know what else? I think I should film it. Yeah. I mean, guys, I'd be a fool not to ride this erotic tidal wave our culture seems to be on, film it, do the next Fifty Shades of Grey, my style, you know? My film would be real, it would be tasteful, it would be...
Often, when it dries, He came home to watch TV. But on that day he came back and started smoking. He knew that Mom hid the dopes behind the TV and in the chandelier. She did it for dad, she never smoked. So he took a package of Admiral And he started smoking.
He conjured us into it. And who's more powerful? The one who made the storm or the one who convinced us into battle to defeat it? A man of his capacities, his state of mind becomes reality. We are subject to it.
Lord Thomas Hamilton. I didn't know him, but I understand you did. Miss Guthrie tells me you were part of the first effort with Lord Hamilton and Peter Ashe to introduce the pardon to Nassau. As with most things, the men first into the breach bear the heaviest casualties. But in the hindsight of victory, they were the ones whose sacrifice made it possible.
I would argue as long as that is true, there's a chance, however remote, that she will frustrate your efforts to send me off to my death. Out of curiosity, how would she go about doing that? Well, I have no idea. Everything and anything in her power, I imagine, up to and including walking out in the middle of the road ahead of us to be run over by your horses in the hope of slowing you down for even a moment. It is fascinating to me how stubbornly you people expect the unlikeliest of outcomes because you prefer them.
-Steve's house. And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and... that's my house. -It's all so close. -Yeah. Exactly. I mean, it's all within a mile or something.
Yeah. - On the bone. That's the tendon. It is tendovaginitis. So the tendon had stress and the ligament.
Or I will. Man: Let's get out of here. Mnh! Sean: So, now the Axelrod name will be forever affixed to this building for all time.
One of who? So now what? Snyder's out as of tomorrow. The Governor-General's gonna select a new Proxy to run the bloc. What does that mean for you?
Body armor seems to be some kind of alloy, but this fibrous mesh, this is... this is pliable. Mmm, check out this membrane at the nape of the neck. We need to cut it open. We don't know what's inside this thing. Yeah, exactly. What if the suit isn't protecting it from us?
[Breathing heavily] Oh, God. - You have keys for that? - My dad was DWP. He had keys for everything.
[Camera shutters clicking] Elias Harper. He blew up Grand Central, and then, four days later, he blew up the FBI's emergency command center. [Camera shutters clicking] And do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?
Now if I follow this correctly... Who's that guy? Uh, Mr. Smitrovich takes pictures for our newsletter. Our understanding of the true workings of history gives us access to the levers of power. Your studio, for instance, is a pure instrument of capitalism.
He was breathing fire right at me. An emergency hearing was held this morning which declared Asher a free man. Where's my mom? - She passed, Hank. - Oh. I didn't take that little boy's ship.
That campus is crawling with marriage material. Mm, I did like the boys, but once I realized all I wanted to be was a Palos Hills Mom, I was like, "Lissa, "why are you torturing yourself at boring college "when you could go home and get the best education from the prettiest Palos Hills Mom ever?"
Excuse me. Okay, ladies. Let's say grace. Bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this meal.
And one who's just beginning to understand his power. And I'm not? You're not the same. You access the supernatural. It works through you.
I'd prefer you didn't especially when I had nothing to do with it. So the fact that it went missing the day I told you what I did that's just a coincidence? I suppose it is. Hanna, the police haven't come knocking with a warrant. The only person who suspects that backup drive is in this house is you.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself and stop pretending! Pretending? ! Pretending that this is the real you-- the blond hair, the glasses, the sensible fashion. People wear masks for a reason-- to hide who they are-- just like you have been doing for the past 5 years.
Yeah. - Really? Mm-hmm. - Feldman. Smell you later. You bounce back surprisingly quickly after putting a bottle up your butt.
The Emblem of Thura... has been activated. For the first time in 4,000 years. The Emblem of Thura. It was created to imprison gods.
- All right. I'm going after it. Alert the pack. Anyone sees Vargas, kill her. You were trapped in the precinct all day.
It took MOKICHI four days to die. At the end, he sang a hymn. His voice was the only sound. The people of the village who were gathered on the beach were always silent. The people were watched closely so the bodies could not be given a Christian burial.
I've been told to get you to abandon the faith. This... This is from the pit. You're tied so you can't move and hung upside down. An incision is made.
By this time, I observed he had acquired considerable skill with the language. And seemed to be at peace with his situation. I have good news. A man has died in Edo. Okada San'emon.
She didn't come alone, brother. Kol: Now, Nik, I mean, you did go after my girl. - It can't be. - It's Kol.
Of course. Marius, I wanted to ask you something. Go ahead. The day Eliza was attacked, she said you were going to meet. Could you tell me what happened? I was supposed to be there at 7:50.

Well, he's just... he's not a fan of big government, or a big fan of government, period. - He's just... - Wow, my mother's dating an anarchist. - That's brilliant. - What can I tell you?
It might still have his voice on there. - I've found out something else. - You're bluffing. A vessel owned by Stoneheart. Its contents were kept from me.
- Thanks, hon. I think that Pree's enjoying himself a little too much. - How's it down there? - Testing your lens now. How's this supposed to work?
- Testing your lens now. How's this supposed to work? Well, theoretically, Connaver's device has been on Arkyn, so it should have absorbed that radiation signature. The beta radiation isn't visible to the eye, but those bang-ass lenses will translate it into something you can see. Look for anything red... well, assuming that the device is actually here.
What? No, no, I have a...headache. If our calculations are correct... - And they are. - And they are.
And that's what I did. I took another human being's life. And, in the process, destroyed what was left of mine. But the people in these rooms, you got me sober. You got me back on my feet, which is just as well, as I walk everywhere now.
Okay, Malik Said, 25, a first-generation Egyptian American, was found dead this morning on the outskirts of Cairo when an unsub threw this into his car. Simmons: [Whistles] Wow. Chemical attacks... Brutal. Burns everything inside and out.
It's our job to uphold it. Your government has records on everything that happened during the Arab Spring. I believe you know who this last person in the picture is. I can't say we do. The last I checked, the U.S. is Egypt's number-one aid provider.
If -- if anything, this is -- this is my fault. I thought you meant Monte, and I confused you. [ Sighs ] Can I... tell you a little secret? No!
[ Robotic voice ] What's the most dangerous type of uranium cake? Yellow! Hey. What's going on? Um, I found this inhaler.
Thought maybe that interview triggered something. Oh, well, it didn't. Nobody's ever called you that... ever. Peri, it's been six months, and I still don't remember anything, and even when I get a glimmer, it turns out to be wrong. So your brain is mush.
Mm. South Side was never so bright as the day you crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and came into my loins. [laughs] And now, it's 18-year-old déjà vu all over again. Oh, just temporary, Frankie.
Yeah, I mean, I work with her. -Oh. She is so cool. Sextina's music makes me feel strong, like I can do anything. It doesn't offend you? What about the part where she says,
Hi. Hello. Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call, please. My friend is arranging a wire transfer from the U.S. She's not picking up the home phone and I don't know her cell. How could you not know your wife's cell number?
Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure you want to do that? Q, are you controlling this? Do something, Q!
SANDS: We got hold of all the security cam footage. No one saw your face. And... we had one of our people from the NYPD pull that gun with your prints off the scene. And there's no trace of you being there.
Well, he wants to meet later. Are you gonna go? Well, we're sniffing around Senator Morra and NZT, and all of a sudden I get this call out of the blue? Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Kind of the easiest to impress, since they live by speculation. Because trading on the open market is dead when it comes to derivatives. The Sharpe ratio isn't even comparable with dark pools. I mean, no market depth feed, risk becomes a virtual non-entity. And go ahead, call your clients, take this down.
It's the law, Miss Seferian, not an oversight on my part. You're not doing what I asked you to do. These have been inconvenient for me. Yes. You know what? These murders have been a big inconvenience for all of us!
- Can we do something about this smell? - Oh, yeah. It is a little rank, yeah. - There is an odor. - Yeah. Well, I lost a glass of milk. You lost a glass of milk?
They were never charged with any crimes, but hidden in their backgrounds are whispered accusations-- incidents that were swept under the rug. So your theory is that someone has reorganized a 15th-Century cult to hunt and kill pedophiles. It fits the fact pattern. Not all of them. My associate, Mr. Weston, the man who started us down this road, was many things, but a pedophile was not one of them.
Okay, then. Just the name. That's impossible. Liz: That file.
I need to see him right now. - Okay. He stepped out. - Call him. He has me hold his phone.
I'm getting in. All I need is a pretty face o help me get there. Know where I can find one of those? Remember the jazz club you took me to in that little cave in St. Germain? We should go there right now.
So would I. But you're giving her away. For what? A business deal hat will never hold? A war that will never end?
You don't gotta be dirty. You just gotta smell bad. I see. A little behind the ears? They treat us like we're not people.
It's the only shot we got. Patterson? Yep, on it. We ran this photograph from ZOMO's self-portrait painting through Bing street view, and we got a match. This apartment complex is on a street in Dumbo.
How do we know that ZOMO doesn't want us to find this place? The last time we followed one of his paintings, it led us to a bomb. We can't just go in there waving our FBI flag. Well, then... let's not go in as FBI at all. This dog can really smell bombs?
It belonged to your mom. She bought it when you were born... to match your eyes. How did you... After she passed away, some of her things were sold. I knew how much that necklace meant to her, so I bought it.
Hey, can I have your autograph? - Look, it's Emmitt Smith! An Argus Airline flight has been reported missing with 75 people on board. A spokesman for the airline has confirmed that search and rescue teams friends and family have gathered outside the airport and are demanding answers. We're going live now to T.F. Green Airport.
I mean, the FAA would have figured that out themselves. I mean, the fact that they needed to call us at all means that the intrusion's much more sophisticated. I'm thinking that Flight 272's onboard GPS device may have been tampered with. Okay, wait a minute. One device can cause 50 separate phantom planes to appear?
The only thing I can think of, uh... hard-wire in through the plane's entertainment system. She must be issuing commands through the thrust-management computer. Erica has control of the engines! A security researcher claimed to have done it successfully, but the airlines are all denying that it's possible. Typical big business:
Sorry, Lizzy. We just got so caught up in writing. I love writing. And I love your work ethic, Jenna. Well, I would love it more if you got published, but today, you are my favorite editorial fellow, despite the coffee incident.
Huh? But the car, and uh... Uh... never mind. Whoa, fuck! Time to go. Go where?
Because you're sober? - Because an Oscar is meaningless. It's all meaningless. I dedicated myself to helping others. I turned my home into a halfway house for troubled addicts.
- Lillian Forrester... - Hack. Is one of the most respected journalists in the game. This will be big. She did that piece on the Pope, the one you liked.
Beautiful Japanese morning! Dealing with weather every day. This our fourth time trying to climb. Finally we're peeking out in the sun. Yay, Lando! Every day has been planned good.
One mistake. That's all it took to just erase all the good I did before. You were poisoned. It's, it's not your fault. People don't know that.
You'll live in a nearby estate that I've rented under Thomas' name. If you make a few appearances at French court, show off your pregnancy, no one should suspect the child is mine and not yours. But where will you be while your belly grows? Here, where I can hide if I need to. This estate you've rented.
No, you don't need the boy. You don't need George. You can't put a boy on the stand, it ain't fair. Oh, look who's turned up to save the day! Just in time, Mr Blackwood, just in time to witness Jericho justice.
- in the oven at 350... - Ladies, ladies... focus. My guy says there's a lot of money to be made for anybody who's willing to... How shall we say... But maple syrup isn't illegal.
Just like in Speed. I still haven't seen the movie. We hack a few seconds of innocuous footage of the rocket into the security system, have it repeat and then Happy can waltz in and out without anyone seeing. Mission control is over a mile from the launchpad, so camera surveillance is all they're seeing of the rocket. You know, I hate to point this out, but in Speed,
Sir, your denial of our request violates procedural due process. I may not be a high-priced lawyer, Mrs. Florrick, but I know the rules: no extra time. Mr. Peltola? Pursuant to Rule 7B, a precinct chair must certify all votes cast and the number of voters registered at the precinct. - I know the rules.
I'm sorry. Have we met? I'm not seeing any post-concussion red flags. But if your memory loss persists, you should get an MRI, or a CT scan. Maybe a PET scan.
But the guy who brought him in came to get him before I was done. He was all sweaty, freaking out. He said he stole the dog from a cop who abused it, and the cop was coming back to get him. What cop? No cop ever showed up.
I hope you can figure this out. You know, on jobs like this, something happens every day on these sites. I need to know that my guys can get help when they need it. Excuse me. EricO 'Brian'sphone is infected with malware.
You know, like a... like a bad-ass. The router that Eric's phone connected to isn't here. You're sure you got the right location? I'm positive. Well, maybe our hacker removed the device.
I'm positive. Well, maybe our hacker removed the device. Wanted it to remain undetected. Wait, wait, guys, it just showed up. And... now it's gone.
Please tell your team that's our top priority. Pay attention tonight. I'm gonna teach you a few things. The first is called a pattern interrupt. The brain has learned certain actions like shaking hands or tying a shoe as one single motion.
What do you think about? Like, his hair, his eyes. Sometimes just his name. - Is that normal? - Absolutely. Because my two friends, Holly and Ellie?
- No, it's come on, let's go! - Oh! - Hey. - Oh, hey. Brought back your can of ravioli.
I got to go, too. I sat by the space mates yesterday, and they're not as nerdy as we thought. We're gonna go jump on the gym mats and act like we're in zero gravity. Beep-beep! Molly, say hi to Ukraine.
Susanna, Kelly, the second floor mirror dude is here! Okay, I was wearing my skinny jeans, so I did not know it was me! Brick, are you warm enough? Oh, definitely. An unexpected bonus of looking like a million bucks-- I've discovered that petroleum-based fabrics really hold in the heat.
So he's gonna write this story either way, all right? So if we shine him on, he's just gonna dig deeper. So yes? He's probably gonna nose around about the shooting, Nick, and Rollins' gambling operation. Look, anything you say can and will be used against you. Understood?
I was there for some of it. Harrowing, just to watch. It's over now. So do you feel you have... - Closure?
That pathetic peacock of a man was not going down without a fight. I had a choice to make -- be the better dancer or the bigger man. So, I stepped off the dance floor and made the obvious call. You want to win over a crowd? Invite a lonely mom to dance.
Dad! Thank you. A lot can happen before the big day. Believe me, I've already tried. That thing is indestructible.
Right, right, like now. I'm not looking at-- I mean, I'm looking here, but I don't look at-- I should look at you so you- sure. - Correct. - Okay, go. Okay, for example, when you're talking about her pictures, try to use positive statements, not just critical ones.
All right, let's pluck some vegetables. Let's do it. Where did the corn come from, daddy? We plucked it yesterday. I didn't see it here yesterday.
Why would we do that when we were just trying to make this go away? No, no, no, no, no. Someone's targeting us, someone who knew about that tape and knew they could use it against us. Uh, uh, one of the other test subjects, someone on the crew. I'm gonna need a list of all of the people that knew about that video.
No book in the shop. Regina, you said the last place you saw it was Henry's room. Yes, but it's not there. Swept away by the last curse. A book can't just disappear.
You could never lose me. But this... this is our only chance. Think of our baby. Think of being a mother. Our child will never know its father.
Like, if I say "nutmeg," will she wake up and start screaming? What kind of pet are you interested in adopting? We have dogs, cats, rabbits. Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me. The girls want an actual dog.

Sounds like a real catch. He's facing eight counts of sex trafficking. Only one of the girls is brave enough to testify against him. The rest refused. You didn't offer them protection?
I realized this is what we needed to do... meet violence with violence. The Shadow League disagreed, so they kicked you out. Yeah, but you didn't need them, did you? They're a bunch of wannabes. I e-mailed Painless to tell her what I had done and to ask her for another mission.
Okay, if there's one thing that I've learned in the 15 years of doing this is that at some point, you have to stop changing things. You have to be happy with what you've made. You're scared. What would I be scared of? Yeah, why don't we make the machine jerk us off, too?
That's what I'm saying. There's ingenuity in there. You've been sitting with this machine for a few months now. It's easy to lose sight of what's great when it's right in front of you. You get used to it.
How many? Okay, Gabe, first of all, you didn't actually die, so there's that. And secondly, we didn't give people much notice, so they just... they sent flowers. They sent a lot of flowers. I sent the flowers.
Because if you don't, it will consume you the way it consumed me and your great aunt... That is crazy. No, it's not! I tried to save you from it, to spare you, but I can't now. You gotta do it on your own.
I've done terrible things. What terrible things? She'll wake up. They always do. I made a deal with something.
I daresay she will vouchsafe our intentions. We endeavor to learn what you know of a rare coin. Why is he talking like that? You get used to it. This coin is special.
And there he is. At the bank. Those shadows. The same as the ones I saw on Ms. Galway. It's like their dark sides trying to get out.
In the meanwhile, I will track a succubus and be prepared to strike. Except you have no idea what she looks like in human form. But we know someone who does. So, I help you find this thing, I get a lock of her hair. Understood.
I know what you speak of. It's been said mothers can feel an absence after having a baby. A sense of intense loss. I know... But this is different.

Supposedly good against all manner of demons. Then again, never been tested. Mills, we got a sighting of our demon babe. You find the heart? Yeah, I think we're closing in.
- Third one, I think. ♪What if I told you that I happen to know an excellent ballroom dancer who's available this evening? I guess... I would have to ask... does he have good hygiene? I mean, once a health inspector, always a health inspector. As a matter of fact, he is a doctor.

We'll see what happens. Oh, my God, they've been up there a long time. Let's just hope they don't open the hall closet. It's where I shoved all the baby stuff. Well, she said we didn't have to clean it up.
Oh, my God, they've been up there a long time. Let's just hope they don't open the hall closet. It's where I shoved all the baby stuff. Well, she said we didn't have to clean it up. Yeah, but a house looks bigger when it's not cluttered.
The house was so different then. There was an oak tree there where the barn is, remember? Yeah. I loved that tree. Yeah, I know you did.
Our code doesn't stand up. The prototypes are running too hot. I'm fighting the deadline of my life here. Can I do this? Listen.
Well he's smart. Unlike this asshole. We swept the precinct for bugs. We found just the one transmitter that hijacked everything within a 30 foot radius. Then there's this.
Gave me up to the federals. But what I've been through today, standing here and seeing you two there so... - soft... I'm set free of my anger. - Uh, okay! I ain't gonna lie to you.
We are complete. We shall have need of each other. The chaos will envelop us all. Who is Edward Sexby? The sun shines on you on your birthday.
I have heard a man's ears crack like a whip. I have seen a man's eyes bleed and his brains fall through his nose like a custard. What if I find no proof of the Countess's treachery? Look for seditious pamphlets and letters from William Goffe. If you find none, then bring me something to ensnare the old Papist.

Would've been 20, but we only got 14. That's not enough arrests. Well, no one asked you. It's a self-evaluation. Come on, Scully.
We appreciate your service. Look, I know there's been a lot of misconceptions about my financial situation, but I am ready to put that to rest right now. Boom goes the dynamite. Oh, my God. That's $20,000 right there, and I intend to use it as a down payment on a mortgage. Where did you get this money?
And you wear a suit, and... That. Did you just point at my bald spot? No. Look. We're putting the apartment on the market.
Daniel. What are you fishing for? Trout, mostly. They do love a good curlytail grub. Trick is to find that special spot just outside the run, where the big ones -- the smart ones -- are holding low.
They must be brought home, and they must be punished for the sake of all. Appreciate you coming down, agent. But I'm afraid you may have just cost Uncle Sam a tank of gas. Oh, why's that? You came up here to investigate Drew Neely's murder, right?
Yeah, he steals them from the storage annex. What the hell do you want with ladies' nylons? - They're rationed. - And? Girls love them. Girls can't get them.
I got it. How much time? A minute 33, 32... Cassidy, you copy? We're with you. There's not enough time for a full evacuation.
Anton. Medium cappuccino, dry, one and a half shots. This yours? Why you call me this name? The computer says it's for Anton. Hello.
- It's done. - It better be. They find our fingerprints on this thing, they're gonna hang us from the Washington Monument. Five diplomats are dead. As far as I can tell, the lottery is alive and well.
What is this video? Another surveillance video. This one's from the 23rd Precinct, early voting. Um, I've never seen that video until this moment. And this video?
Now, how do I know that Mr. Grant did this? There were no video cameras there. Well, luckily, science has provided its own video camera. In her last desperate moments, Dani scratched Mr. Grant, leaving his skin under her fingernails.
But I have a couple of questions. So do I. The device I brought you from the Bergenzer Bank? I need it. That's not possible.
Of course I wish Christine wasn't in the middle of it, but we are too far down that road now. No, we are not. She's not trained, she shouldn't be in that position. Are you questioning my orders, Cameron? We are way outside issues of operational authority here.
I'm gonna sleep with my head over there. Okay. Yeah, that's... That's gonna be better for me. You know what, I'm gonna get some water. - Oh, hey. - My room looks totally different. Turned it into a workout space.
If only she'd cook me dinner. Casey's somewhat of a loner. No family to speak of. He freelances with various tiger teams around the country. Is that as exciting as it sounds?

It's Christine's party. Booth is taking care of it and that makes me uncomfortable, because I have no frame of reference for an important event in my daughter's life. Oh, honey... it wasn't that bad. I mean, your mother and I did all we could. You could have lived an honest life, Dad.
- Ma, me, mi, mo, mu A, e .... Mom, I told you to knock! My sweater! It has shrunk!
You're lying. You are sick. Potentially very sick. - See this bird? - It's pretty.
Then I have a problem. The only witness still alive, your own father, wasn't sure that it happened that way. Great. What did he say? Dad... looks great. 'Cause he's got the DiNozzo genes.
- I'll be in commander's uniform. That's the reason Bodeen was wearing the uniform. Got there 15 minutes early to silence him. On the left is a page from Commander Saxon's report strategically ranking the Navy ports of call in Asia. These three ports had service by Calvin Ling's company.
And me. And leave tomorrow. A mark of flowers, hmm? I used to pick roses every morning. They cut me to pieces, but I didn't care.

Uh, the contrast just gives us more of a detailed look. Um, yeah, you know, and it'll give your toes a chance to dry before the biopsy. - Perfect. - Yeah. What do we got? Lisa Campbell, 32, found in apartment trash chute.
Thanks. So, I'm going to the library later, if you want to come. [ Sighs ] Brick, what are you doing? I can't decide. Do I want to smell like a polo player or a yachtsman?
- Yes, absolutely. Did you bring alcohol? Girl, get to know me already. I'll grab some glasses. So our girls are out in the boondocks, huh?
♪ High hopes ♪ ♪ He's got high hopes ♪ ♪ He's got... ♪ Ms. Tascioni, don't take this the wrong way, but you have an awful voice. I know.
♪ He's got... ♪ Ms. Tascioni, don't take this the wrong way, but you have an awful voice. I know. I know, but this city... it inspires me. Really?
Here it is. Such a shame. She was a sweet girl. Well, it says here Camila attended several job interviews. It's mandatory for the girls to go to job interviews before they emancipate.
Come on in and shut the door. Um, I was just calling to see if there was anything else I could do before I throw myself off the balcony. Well, you actually might not have to. Look at the footage from the bedroom. The camera just focuses on the dresser.
It wasn't my choice. - Hey, Nick, what's up, man? - What's up, Winnie? - Hey. - Can we talk for a second? - Can I talk to you?
You're a footnote. For a while, you had me fooled. I mean, I thought I heard a heartbeat. But it wasn't a heartbeat. It was an echo.
- You're insane. - No, Major. You can't dismiss me that easily. I did what had to be done. That's why my men loved me.
- No, Major. You can't dismiss me that easily. I did what had to be done. That's why my men loved me. I ordered them to kill Bajoran scum and they'd do it, they'd murder them and they'd come back covered in blood, but they felt clean.
You can't dismiss me that easily. I did what had to be done. That's why my men loved me. I ordered them to kill Bajoran scum and they'd do it, they'd murder them and they'd come back covered in blood, but they felt clean. Why did they feel that way, Major?
I was sitting here thinking, last year at this time, I was fighting the Cardassians in some nameless swamp. And if you'd told me that just one year later, they'd be gone, I'd be wearing this uniform, up here in charge of protecting some wormhole... Protecting your Celestial Temple. I envied Vedek Winn because she was a true believer. I wanted my faith to be as strong as hers.
- lt's stable? It's stable. That's right, Jake. It's the first stable wormhole known to exist. Please, continue.
I don't like it. Why don't I lock them up and call the Klingons to come get them? If they're enemies of the Klingon High Council... They haven't broken any laws here. You can't just throw them in jail.
Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, ... ..our hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Homeworld. But perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised here. This is our prison. It should not be theirs. Years ago, your parents made a great sacrifice for their families.
We didn't know there was anything missing. Ba'el. Goodbye, Worf. I know that there are those among you who may question what I am about to do. You would not be wrong to do so.
What's happening? I'm attempting to neutralise your pain receptors. What are you gonna do to me? I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They will learn and mimic your neural-firing patterns.
They never should have come here. - What were they thinking? - They came looking for me. Humans are so sentimental. I betrayed them.
- It could be human. - They took this path. Now. Thank you. There you are, brother. Here is the visor. May I ask why you wanted it?
The man you want was here several weeks ago, questioning some aliens. Who were these aliens? I don't know. They looked dangerous. They attacked him.
- The Romulans? These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is an ancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where the Captain died were also Romulan. The leader of our attackers was Romulan.

Seismic activity has increased by a factor of three. If the cooling continues at this rate, Atrea will become uninhabitable in 13 months. We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures. That would be temporary. The only permanent solution is to reliquefy the core.
It's alright. I'm just trying to dislodge this power cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's alright.
You have been manipulating me, haven't you? - Jean-Luc, what are you saying? - The necklace. It broke! I saw it in the freighter on the floor by the fire. I left it there.
I felt the wave of dizziness. When I looked up, you and Cmdr La Forge were on the opposite side of the room. Capt Picard was gone. I thought I had blacked out and had not observed your movements. At my birthday party, the cake was chocolate.
But it should not have interfered with my duties. - My behaviour was... - Inexcusable. And understandable. It may be that what you are looking for cannot be found here.
What? He's not real. You just said so. I said he was not Kahless. But in the minds of our people, he can be just as powerful. Even now, two members of your own crew are sitting on our holodeck waiting for him.
If he really is an impostor, don't worry. Kahless has been dead for 1,000 years. But the idea of Kahless is alive. Have you ever fought an idea? It has no weapon to destroy, no body to kill.
He's not Will. He is Will, but... You know what I mean. It's hard for me to separate my feelings for them. Deanna.
[Crash] Do you know the story of Romulus and Remus? Sons of Mars, god of war. If you're waiting for an emergency, this is it. The brothers were abandoned and raised by wolves.
Hey, guys, let's fly. They'll be back with reinforcements. [Yelling] jimmy: It's time you told us about the dragon. satori:
This part here, this little pin got broken. lt should be replaced. Really? But it's an outdated part, it's not produced any more. And what shall I do? There's nothing to do. This typewriter's going to break down.
Why don't you back off the table? That is too late. And where is the ball? Way behind. And your centre of gravity, in your ass!
Where did you sleep? - In empty houses. - Were you not cold? Sometimes yes.. I have this anorak.
Now you're fucked. You stupid bloody idiot! Drugs, for Christ's sake. Well, three cheers for you. I hope you're bloody well happy now! It's funny.
Watch your dress. Thanks. You want to go out? Look at that moon. My grandmother used to call that a "china moon" like a big old plate of china.
May I see it? - You fire this recently? - Yes, I have. We recovered a bullet from that bedroom wall. The rifling marks are clean.
I promised the American people I'd do something about the drug problem. You are. We support the Colombians' efforts against the cartels... We've accomplished nothing. Do these drug dealers think we're powerless?
- lt was. - Then I don't get it. What happened? - Nobody knows. - How stupid are these people?
Let's go! - Take it easy, Andy. Got to keep moving. Dan! We can't stay here! The car!
Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be out of here and back to normal. Here it shows these girls talking about how one of their friends... got a date with Skutch and how envious they all are. This is how I felt about it. I'm a little bitter about it, as you can see. I show here how I thought that most teenage boys... are very cruel and aggressive.

I'm a little bitter about it, as you can see. I show here how I thought that most teenage boys... are very cruel and aggressive. And if girls could see that I was more kind and sensitive, they would like me. They were kind of impressed by the fact I could draw. I couldn't understand why they liked these cruel, aggressive guys and not me. I was more kind and sensitive, more like them.
I guess not, since we're moving to France, what do you care? They have a plan to widen this road and put it through where these trees are. There's a big X that the surveyors sprayed on here... and I erased it the other day. Then I took out their sticks from the other side of the road. They're going to widen this road... and take a big chunk of land out of that side with all these trees. Put 12 dream homes back in there.
The whole culture's one unified field... of bought, sold, market-researched everything. It used to be people fermented their own culture. It took hundreds of years, and it evolved over time. That's gone in America. People now don't even have any concept that there ever was... a culture outside of this thing that's created to make money.
Crumb was incredibly exciting and incredibly hot. There were just a handful of us... doing this new form of comics. And what he was doing was just more innovative... than what any of us had even thought of. It was fun to be a part of that and to see ''Zap'' suddenly everywhere. From this concept of Robert's, this fantasy of doing his own comic book... with a glossy cover and actually printed... to seeing it turning up in all the windows on Haight Street, around town... hearing people talk about it... having the other artists show up and wanting to be a part of it. It happened very quickly.
I'm at the point in meditation where I have to use a bed of nails. I'm not a great expert at the nails, so I cover a portion of the nails... with this thin bandana so it's not too painful to me. I have to regulate the amount of pain that I take with it. - How long can you sit on those? - I can sit a couple hours.
I have to regulate the amount of pain that I take with it. - How long can you sit on those? - I can sit a couple hours. The cloth cleans your intestines out on the inside. You might say it gratifies your intestines. Every six weeks, regularly, I have to pass it through my entire body.
Hi. All right, people, settle! And... action! Wow! Look at these camels. These are real camels.
At Universal, we used to shoot one or two scenes a day. But Eddie can knock off 20, 30. He`s incredible! And action. Okay, you`re Dr. Eric Vornoff, and you`re upset.
And... those there. - Okay, well, if I have any questions, I'll let you know. - Is it a little hot for you back here? - It's... yeah. You could turn it down a tad. I suppose you have to be... pretty careful with the temperature, with the animals.
Have a nice weekend. Strange to think that bird is probably gonna outlive us. - Strange? - Did you ever teach it to say anything? - Yes.
Strange to think that bird is probably gonna outlive us. - Strange? - Did you ever teach it to say anything? - Yes. - What does it say, Harold?

It can't be worth much. We are less politically aware than your son. It's enough for two bullets. We are just two bullets short of liberating Taiwan. So let's get that metal. The workers deserve entertaining, don't they?
- Do you like dumplings? - Yes. - Do you like meat? - Yes. That's good. If Youqing does as daddy says... our lives will get better and better. Our family... is like a little chicken.
And a lovely mother-to-be, too. Congratulations, Mrs. Weiler. Thank you. My mother smiled for a week. I'd never seen her so happy.
You should've thought of that before you took off. You abandoned your children, Mr. Weiler. I'm not much of a father. And I've made more than my share of mistakes. Sonya never got to be much of a kid. And Greta never knew her mother. I didn't make it any easier on them.
I knew Greta's deafness was my fault and it put me in a chronic state of panic. I was responsible for her, but I couldn't take care of myself. Where are your brains? Playing so close to the edge with your sister. Can't close my eyes for a minute.
I first heard the name Beethoven when I was 17. I had heard that his music aroused such passion as to be dangerous. Some thought it obscene and unsuitable for the young. I wrote to my cousins, Theresa and Josephine. They lived in Vienna, the great music capital of the world.
illegible. Then... there was this terrible storm, a deluge. The woman hid in her room... waiting. Ashamed to show her face, I'd say. And then, the letter arrived. You opened the letter. I had to.
What new insanity is this? It has come to our attention that you have been bribing servants... in order to have access to the boy in secret... while you well know that Herr Beethoven would not allow... You are talking about my son. My son, who I have not seen for a year, who is being taught to hate me. The decree of the court states...
Though the ship was blessedly free of rats a strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers. Claudia and I alone seemed immune. We kept to ourselves pondering the mystery of each other. We reached the Mediterranean. I wanted those waters to be blue...
The swamp? He belongs with those reptiles. He deserved to die. Then perhaps so do we, every night of our lives. He was my maker.

The men we honour tonight fought bravely and died for us. And though they have given everything, we must not pity them. Their pain is gone. Now, at last, their souls are free. When we lack the fruits of their labours, we will miss them. Here.
You don't understand. This place is secret, it's private. The authorities keep it classified. No one knows it exists. If it leaked out, the public wouldn't allow it.
And they all said, "Who can this be?" The little boy didn't answer, so the big daddy bear ripped his arm off. You are so cute. You're far too young to be out here on your own. Where are your other little friends?
- I want you to take my place. - What? The men respect you. You're a natural leader. No.

"The poet, Pablo Neruda, in Rome." Central Station. A group of rowdy people has inconvenienced the travellers... who crowd the station platforms every day. These protesters... are not drunkards... nor the usual hotheads who protest just for the fun of it. They are a group of intellectuals, writers and journalists.
What am I supposed to do? No one else can help me. They're all fishermen here! What am I supposed to do? Fishermen fall in love, too!
It's called "Song for Pablo Neruda." Even if it's about the sea... it's dedicated to you. If you hadn't come into my life I never would have written it. I've been invited to read it in public. And even though I know my voice will shake, I'll be happy.
It spills over from time to time. It says yes, then no... then no. In blue, in foam, in a gallop... it says no, then no. It cannot be still. My name is sea, it repeats... striking a stone but not convincing it.

How are you? - Oh, fabulous, fabulous. Of course, I'm a little tired... from running for ten hundred fuckin' miles because there was no fuckin' car waiting for me! What did I tell you if something went wrong? I told you to act like a drunk vagrant imbecile. - Is that too much of a fuckin' stretch? - I got nervous. The cops were all over the place.
I don't believe it. You want to have sex with him. - What? - "Use the ouchless." "We have bungee cords." I'm frightened.
- Thank you, sweetheart. From what school are you trained, Dr. Wong? Freud? - Uh, nah. I don't go in for that dream stuff. - Really? You don't think patients should examine their dreams?

For to fight the cold sea is only to prolong your suffering. But Sean Michael was green with it. And he flailed and cried out... and he beat the water with his legs and arms... till the sea grew to hate him and refused to swallow him up. It was a full day later... when people gathering mussels on the strand found him. Some was even afraid to touch him.
It'd be a great help to me if you kept stirring the tar in this bucket. I'd love it. In the olden times people used cowhide on their curraghs. Then it was calico. Now we make do with canvas.
That you, Fiona? We saw the fire. Grandfather! Christ Almighty, Fiona. We were worried sick about you.

Be calm. Try to calm him. Oh. - Oh, hush. Hush, my child. The geese, they cackle.
I planted that forest. And I think things may be in our power. You understand? Perhaps the climate itself is in our control. Why not? And if in a thousand years, people are happy... I will have played a part in that happiness. A small part.
At your age, it's truly unattractive. My age doesn't come into it. No? A man with nothing in his life... with no real life... subsists on a fantasy. Then that is something in his life. The hay is cut.
You're angry with me... because you think I married your father for my own convenience. If you believe in oaths... I give you my oath on this: I married him for love. He was a famous man, a man of learning... and I was captivated by it. And it was not real.
What is it you want? And how can you speak to me that way? What gives you the right? - You're nothing. Nothing!
It's 'cause there's a lot of pain in my head. And I'm gonna tell you something else too. I landed three jobs after the war. And I lost every one of them 'cause of them dreams. It wasrt because I couldn't do the work, son.
Some way or another they found out I spent time in that mental hospital. Did you tell them you went into that hospital voluntary, for nightmares? "It's nothing personal," they said. Law says you can't work for the city or state, within the vicinity of children if you've spent time in a mental hospital or corrective institution. It's because of our government you were there.

Excuse me? Did I say something? Why don't you just go on and get your jollies off of somebody else? All right, I'm tired of all of you making fun about my car! First shot I get at a decent job and my car blows up.
You and me, man. You and me, man. You and me, man. We got to that helicopter just as the enemy was coming in. - Leave him! Just you!
I wanted to tell you that I'm turning down Eastern Europe. I more or less thought you would. Nice seeing you again, sir. - Are you all right? - Are you crazy?
And, Gary, don't tell people you had tequila with your coffee. You didn't have coffee this morning. Hi, I made it to New Haven. I'll be home tomorrow. If you get hungry, there's some leftover stew.
A few days ago, something happened to me. I was driving in New england and I hit an animal. - A wolf. - In New england? Are you sure? I'm positive.
Gonna rebel, were they? We'll take'em to lockup this evening. Guoqing! Hear that? Uncle, Uncle, please let me go. What are you crying about?
If you don't move it, you're welcome to spend the night. Who's there? Someone's bashed Yang Gao. Fuck! On his way home he saw some kids from Liutiao bullying the retarded boy. They were making him eat cat shit and trying to take away his pole.
Guoqing! Hear that? Uncle, Uncle, please let me go. What are you crying about? I was waiting for tickets, and they hauled me in. Look at you, you think half of Peking is your turf.
The kitchen is all yours. This is Tsu-An Tofu. Unfortunately, you don't have a bamboo steamer, but taste it anyway. - Where's the tofu? - The tofu is blended in with the chicken.

I think... if land-owners married land-owners, rich people married rich people... and illiterates married illiterates, nothing would work. It's much better if people who read marry illiterates, rich people marry poor people, homeless people marry land-owners. So that everyone... can help each other out. I think that's better.
All right. So many people were buried under the rubble, a few drop of water on my head won't harm me... Don't yell at her. There can't have been many victims in your family for you to get married the day after. There were. Cousins, aunts, uncles...
They're not bothered about us. If you dare not say yes turn the page of your book, that will be my reply The problem, I think, is the house. So I'll go andl see the owner and talk to him so that he'll give me this house. It won't cost a lot.

Well, it's not precisely like yours, although it is similar. However, our research shows that the two of you in tandem Have the astounding ability to turn inert objects Into radioactive ones.

"That would be very nice, such... That's fantastic, you actually been there with people who come back and talk to you?" "From new death experiences and there are people in certain traditions like for instance Tibetan Buddhism were trained to go into that after death's day when people invite them. There are actually guide books to help people go through this journey, if you will." Tulku Ling Rinpoche is an abbot from the monastery of Ladakh.
"Paldem Sering, listen without distraction. Now, the blood drinking wrathful ones will appear. Their bodies are dark red or dark blue, with 3 heads 6 arms, and 4 legs spread wide apart. Their 9 eyes gaze into yours, with a furious expression. They hold human skulls full of blood, and they roar like thunder.
It is the natural mind. It is the essence of your own mind. Recognition and liberation are simultaneous." The book of the dead describes how at death, the consciousness is suddenly separated from all the circumstances which made up daily life. Mind experiences its own liberation directly as radiant white light. Both life and death, according to the Bardo Thodol, are a continuous flow of uncertain transitions called "Bardos".
This is what death is. Let yourself go." With more offerings of barley and butter, he invokes the blessings of all the Buddhas, and all the awaken ones. The blood on the head gives an indication that the ceremony has gone well. "If there is some sign that the dead man's consciousness has left the body from a place on the head, then that's a good thing.

And Lulu is like that, sweetie. You could show a little enthusiasm. Why should I be happy that you'll spend thousands of pounds... Hundreds of thousands of pounds. ...persuading people to buy some cheap bit of plastic that they don't even want?
Even on peasant's walls. We dragged these people screaming into the 20th century. We gave them all the mod cons. We gave them the non-squat toilet. Toilet tissue, darling.

He caught me by surprise. He's tough. Breaking him won't be easy. What's happening out there? From what I see on the monitors, they've launched a full search.
- We were outnumbered and outgunned. We never had a chance. You say we could have won, but you weren't there. When I looked at those ships, I didn't just see my death... I saw the death of the human race!
You can give the Centauri some room to maneuver. That again? As far as I'm concerned this is a dead issue. We have to push forward. You told me that before the Centauri came, Narn was an agrarian world a peaceful world. To be free, vou had to fight. That's true, but vou've overcompensated. Like abused children who abuse others as if that'll balance the scales.

- So what's left for me? I'll go to the rainforest to save trees. Maybe I'll practise prayer and abstinence. Save the poor souls in India. Maybe I'll buy a used van and drive across this great country of ours.
I hate to admit I kinda miss the little booger. Hey, you guys. Frank, this just arrived for you. Now, aren't you supposed to tip those overnight delivery guys? Certainly, you don't have to, but I always feel like,
And we'd drive to church. I love white gloves. I guess because they remind me of a time when people would smile at each other on the sidewalks and help each other carry the groceries into the house. We would go to Mendelsons drug store and sit at the counter, have a cool milkshake and we would sit on a porch and listen to the night, filled with tree crickets and spring peepers. And then, the way that a young girl would wake up one day, sharing the honour that the blessed Virgin Mother had received.
You know, you're both right. Gaffney, you're being a dumb cluck. Pembleton, you're acting like a child. - That's not what he meant. - I know.

How did Savage come by such a thing? Ah, I can rely on your discretion? Of course. I understand Savage sometimes frequented, well let's to say his affairs took him to a part in Rotherhithe inhabited mostly by Chinese and Lascars. He must have picked it up there. The authorities in Rotherhithe must be informed. They will be.
- So, are you? - No. But my mom still thinks we are. She's, like, in denial or something. Why do girls have to tear each other down?
I think I know one. Sometimes It seems like we're all living In some kind of prison. And the crime is how much we hate ourselves. It's good to get really dressed up, once In a while. And admit the truth.
I didn't say you need it, I said... Never mind. Anyway, here. In case she changes her mind. Oh, this product is amazing!
Commit this to memory, punk one. He's 1 1 years old. From now on, you don't talk to him. You don't go near him. If you or anybody else touches him... ... Iwillbustyourhead againstthecurb and kick your meager brains under a bus. Okay, but you gotta let me go.
You got the same ugly mug you had since the day I met you. I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. I'll find out. Don't believe him. So she's just sitting there, and then Pachyderm... You remember the 'Derm. He says, "I'm gonna go up to her."
Don't believe him. So she's just sitting there, and then Pachyderm... You remember the 'Derm. He says, "I'm gonna go up to her." So he picks up the two pieces of pizza and... And they're steaming hot. They're burning his hands, so he's juggling. He's throwing them in the air.

Each new host has no obligation to past commitments. A Klingon blood oath can never be broken. The old Klingon ways are passing. When I was a young man, the mere mention of a Klingon empire made worlds tremble. Now our warriors are opening restaurants and serving "racht" to the grandchildren of men I slaughtered in battle.
Who's talking about dying? I have no intention of dying. You dishonour yourself already by placing your honour above mine. No Klingon would leave a comrade while he goes to battle. Perhaps you're right.
- Kira here. My access codes are still valid. I'll try to override the security programme but I'm not sure if my clearance level is high enough. We'll try to do the same thing here. Acknowledged. Odo, what is this all about?
Then they weren't affected by the counterinsurgency programme. That means we still have control of them. If we get them on line, we can use them to overload the power grid. - Exactly. - Will that eliminate the force fields?

Thank you for your time. And if you'd like, stop by the shop one day. I have a number of suits that would look quite flattering on you. Two mugs of kanar, on the house. They're the drinks I promised when you first came here.
- Then why didn't you? Cardassians don't involve outsiders in their internal politics, especially Bajorans. Being shot at by your own people goes a little beyond politics. We take our politics very seriously. If I don't get my students to safety, they'll be killed.
This has something to do with Professor Lang and her students? "Students" is a rather benign term for them. "Terrorists" would be more accurate. The Cardassian government would like Hogue and Rekelen returned home. They haven't committed any crimes here.
- in exchange for you. - You've agreed? The Bajoran provisional government has agreed to it. A Cardassian transport will deliver the Bajoran prisoners within five hours. - You don't know what they'll do!
She taught us all how to read. And she grew vegetables in hardpan to feed us. And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a place like Camor. And then, one day she was attacked... ..by two men in the street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying.
And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a place like Camor. And then, one day she was attacked... ..by two men in the street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying. If she'd just given it to them, they probably wouldn't have hurt her. But she knew how important the food was to us.
We'll get you some quarters. OK, let's go. Jason. Your being here, I hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other. We shut down the probe's power system to beam it aboard.
..this venom all over the ship? I'd say so. 60 crewmen are exhibiting strange behavioural changes. Memory loss, fatigue, headaches. One thing is clear.
A true piece of history, Scully. The very first X-File. initiated by J Edgar Hoover himself in 1946. In World War ll, a series of murders occurred in the Northwest, seven here in Browning. Each victim was basically ripped to shreds and eaten as if by a wild animal.
I knew a short cut behind Watkins' house. There was a... a groan,... not animal, but not human. I looked into his window. He was covered in sweat and blood. He was in a great, great pain.
- Mulder? I... think he's telling the truth. - I don't think he killed anyone. - How can you be sure? I just got the toxicology report back on the vial.
- Don't! They'll kill ya! [Scorsese] Andin Colorado Territory, the tragedy was complete. Both protagonists were doomed. Now, to me the most interesting of these classic genres are the indigenous ones the western, which was born on the frontier; the gangster film, which was originated in the east Coast cities; and the musical, which was spawned by Broadway.
Directors that are sadly forgotten now... Allan Dwan, Samuel Fuller, Phil Karlson,Ida Lupino, Delmer Daves, Andre De Toth, Joseph H. Lewis,Irving Lerner.
Killed just about everything that walks or crawled... at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill, for what you did to Ned. You boys had better move away. [Eastwood]I've always felt that the western movie... is one of the fewart forms that Americans can lay claim to. Americans are somewhat masochistic, I must say, about that.
- When her deepest feelings for her husband are aroused, the heroine is overwhelmed by shame and guilt. She seems to be consumed by a malevolent spirit. [Whispering] Or if you will, by her inner demons. You were saying, "The cats..." They torment me. I awake in the night, and the tread of their feet whispers in my brain.
Get away from me! Chris! Violence has become, in my opinion, a defiinite, uh, point, in a script. It has a dramaturgical reason to be there. You see, I don"t think that people believe in the devil... with the horns and the forked tail.
And therefore, they don"t believe in punishment after... they are dead. So, my question was for me, what are people... In what belief people... Or, what are people fearing is better. And that is physical pain. And physical pain comes from violence. And that, I think, is today the only, uh, uh, uh, fact which people really fear, and therefore it has become a-a defiinite part of life... and naturally also of scripts.
[Scorsese] At the end of Kiss Me Deadly, the duplicitous woman who stole this package from a secret government project... was like the wife of Lot who refused to heed the warnings. [Scorsese] Aldrich"s tale led to a few cryptic, threatening words: Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Trinity. This time opening Pandora"s box... meant universal annihilation, the apocalypse. Of course, not all smugglers operated within film noir.
Once she surrenders to the community's pressure, Jane Wyman is trapped. She's left suffocating in their world of pretense and illusions... far from Hudson's Walden Pond. Somehow, they've become the instruments of repression. Beneath the surface of the seemingly ideal setting... lay a sharp indictment of American small-town life. And heaven and nature sing Both Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray stayed within the rules. Their films had the required happy ending.
And so, it"s almost like going from two dimension to three dimension... in the dynamic that"s been created at this point. [Man] There is a misconception that we are surrendering something of art... to a technology that will do it for us. That... That is never the case. But cinema itself is technology. And to say that, oh, well, it can"t be an art... because it"s a mechanical device rushing celluloid through it... is as naive as to say, well, you can"t create... because now it"s a computer rushing numbers through it.
When you were a Corleone, there was no leaving the outfit. It was an evil family bound by fear and torn by treachery, but you served it without ever questioning its legitimacy, as though it was your country. American values... family, free enterprise, patriotism... became totally twisted. even individualism was dead. The organization was a state within the state; the gangster, a chairman of the board; and crime was a way of life.
See, its legs move to do kicks. Picking flowers, huh? Yes, to make medicine for your wounds. Why do you talk to them? I'm explaining to them why I am picking them off their roots.
Picking flowers, huh? Yes, to make medicine for your wounds. Why do you talk to them? I'm explaining to them why I am picking them off their roots. They can't understand you, can they?
You will be all right. He's learning. Money. You're both stars. Don't forget.
But she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!" And I'm like, "Okay. Wait a minute, here." They're not gonna come over and kick her ass. So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one? Women say they hate it if you're all protective. But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously. Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work. You know what? Not service oriented. Just an observation about Europe. My parents never really spoke of the possibility... of my falling in love or getting married or having children.
And so I was doing that... and through the mist, I could see my grandmother. And she was just standing there, smiling at me. And I held it there for a long time... and I looked at her. And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know? And then I dropped the hose... and she disappeared. And so I run back inside and tell my parents.
It doesn't matter what generation you're born into. Look at my parents. They were angry, young May '68 people revolting against everything. The government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds... Then I was born, and my father became a successful architect. We traveled around the world while he built bridges... and, you know, towers and stuff. I mean, I really can't complain about anything.
And when the mind is calm, only then can it receive wisdom. At present, my mind is most agitated! I'm afraid it's the water pump. It's been giving me trouble for some days now. So, what are you telling me, that we're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, is that it? Well, all is not necessarily lost.
You have Francis, I have Gerard. Each of us found her match. You don't know how happy you just made me. Let's not tell the girls. They wouldn't understand.
The whole movie can be a dud... but you're just sitting there... waiting for Joan Crawford to put on her black cowboy shirt again. I'm going to kill you. I know... if I don't kill you first. Gay audiences were desperate to find something. I think all minority audiences watch movies with hope.
They were all very prissy... these little skinny white men with little mustaches who would go like this. Girls, girls, girls! Be careful of my hats. We gotta get down on the stage. I don't care. I won't allow you to ruin them.
He was squirming all during the movie. He just couldn't sit still. And at the part in the movie... where the two men embrace and kiss... he jumped up and said... "You made a goddamn faggot movie"... and stalked out. The day it opened, I happened to be in Miami. We sat down, the movie started... and as the movie progressed... you sensed the audience growing more and more uncomfortable... with what was going on the screen.
No, you don't. I wouldn't know what to do. You can start by putting the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door. Hollywood still runs scared from people... who feel that the very mention of homosexuality... the very display of it, in some form, on the screen... legitimizes the subject. Well, of course it does. It shows that homosexuals are human beings.
That isn't much to put a whole three-hour movie on... even something as gorgeously junky as Ben-Hur. The director of the movie, William Wyler, said "What do you do?" I said, "Let me try something." Let's say these two guys were 15, 16 when they last saw each other. They had been lovers, and they're meeting again... and the Roman wants to start it up. Messala, played by Stephen Boyd, wants to start it up again... with Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston. Heaven knows why, but he does. Anyway, he's Roman. so Willie stared at me, face gray.
Again, you fucked up. This is the how many-eth time? The 12th? He leaves for an appointment with his spring supplier's on Tuesday. Comes back Thursday saying it went fine, and Monday I hear they never saw him. He never showed up. Do you have any explanation for your miserable performance?
Gentlemen, without wishing to embarrass anyone in particular, I must tell you that I've been sent here to take over this investigation because of its poor focus and slipshod execution. My superiors in Moscow agree with me that we should drop the train station surveillance immediately, not only because it's costly in terms of man-hours, but also because it hasn't produced a single viable suspect in a year. And because, and I say this with all due respect to my predecessor, it's based exclusively on one man's intuition. Well, I'm afraid that's not good enough anymore. As of now... we'll run this investigation as professionals.
There's some introductory rubbish, designed to make me sound brilliant. We can ignore that in here, I should think. "Citizen X has probably had a tendency towards isolation since childhood. His internal world, filled with fantasy, is closed to those around him, even those close to him. The adolescence of such a person is, as a rule, painful, because he is often subjected to the laughter of his peers, and at a time when success among them is the subject of his secret dreams.
will you shut up? There's been an accident! The two little brats got away, Zee. But it's not over, is it? They're hiding.
There's been an accident! The two little brats got away, Zee. But it's not over, is it? They're hiding. - And why are they hiding?
The two little brats got away, Zee. But it's not over, is it? They're hiding. - And why are they hiding? - Because they don't want to play.
Of course, let's hope it doesn't rain. It won't rain. The weatherman announced a fall in temperature. Goodnight. These man-mad girls.
What do you think about these extremists? - l don't think anything. - Look at Russia... Tell Judite to look the new candidates over and the Devil take the hindmost. - She always has the last word.
- At nine, you mean. - It's right by the bar. I couldn't get that one. - Is it nine ? - No, no. Don't worry about nine. Here, take this. Come on, girls.
A perfect fucking seven. Do you know where this bus turns around ? Pardon ? Does this bus stay in Glendale ? I don't know.
This man shot Walter Delacroix two times in the back of his head, then raped Hope Percy and stabbed her 17 times before shooting' this sweet girl two times in the back of the head. These families will never see their children graduate from college. They will never attend their wedding. They will never have Christmas with them again. There will be no grandchildren.
Most of your kids in the project are raised by single parents. They're not raping' and killin' people. Really, Helen, you're being suckered. What about the parents of these victims? - Have you counseled them?
Jesus also said "He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword." Purcell had it coming to him. He had it coming! Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. It's the only way we can be sure that they will not kill again. Life without parole. Oh, sure!
This was Hope's big day. Our baby was leavin' home. Her room was empty and the bed was still neatly made. So I telephoned the Delacroixs. Our hearts sank when they told us that Walter hadn't come home that night too.
You want me to go, you say so. Do you ever think about those kids? It's terrible what happened to them kids. It didn't have to happen. Do you ever think about what you and Vitello did to their parents?
But whatever I am today, is because of her. To this day I haven't forgotten something she said. She'd say... "Son, at every turn in life, you'll find two roads. One right, one wrong"
Give me three numbers. Four... zero... nine. - Hello? - What? You don't know me, and I don't know you either, but do you have any needles?
First of which is being the fact that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show. I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers. All right, you know, we're all buddies here. No one wants Norman to lose his finger. We just want to chop it off.
All right, you know, we're all buddies here. No one wants Norman to lose his finger. We just want to chop it off. You know, if fate doesn't smile on old Norman, we'll put that fucker on ice, whisk it right to the hospital, where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on. Well, hopefully, sir.
Ted, good answer. Sit right down. All right. Leo, you be the timekeeper. Norman, give me your watch.
I said, "It is prettier. Let's shoot that way." And I forgot why I needed the car facing the other direction until I got ready to do the second part of the scene. I said, "Uh-oh." But I decided no one would care or notice it.
Scott Frank wrote the screenplay for Get Shorty. The funny thing is, Ed Solomon just wrote a screenplay for me for the next movie I'm directing, which is called Men in Black. They always put the other fella's name into the movie. So there's a line in Men in Black where someone refers to "that idiot, Scott Frank". This is very typical and very real, that actors and important people in Los Angeles never order from the menu.
No, not then. I mean in general. What, you don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor? Whichever. I can see myself in the parts that Robert De Niro plays, or maybe an Al Pacino movie, playing a real hard-on.
Maybe two. This scene coming up here was Rene's hardest scene. But the idea of her being dressed as if she was in a B-movie was totally her idea. Rene came to me in preproduction and said, "What if I come in dressed like a real bimbo?"
We cut around to John's shoulder on this shot because I added the line, "He wants to take you out on account of you broke his nose." Which was never in the script, but in post, I thought it would help the audience to realise that Chili's talking about his own story. So by mentioning the broken nose part, I felt it would help people remember about Ray Bones getting his nose broken back in Miami. Now, check this out.
We do not have a choice. But we have to do something. What if it comes to Japan again? Attacking Godzilla now... would be like igniting explosives enough to bore a hole in the Earth. But... We can't just sit and do nothing.
You okay? Feeling all right? Splendid. Why? I couldn't help noticing you were talking to flowers.
Whatever that means. What do you think? Wouldn't it make me look fat? You should be so picky. He's got the face of a mackerel!
You saw that? What the hell is going on? Pool on the roof must be leaking. Oh, man. This is going to be good.
Leonardo da Vinci. We have 26 ships at sea and don't know which ones are infected. Well, put the ship's ballast under manual control. There's no such thing any more. These ships are totally computerised.
Die, dickweeds! A rabbit's in the system. Send a flu shot. Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.
I don't know how to do anything else. Neither do I. I don't want to either. Neither do I. You know, I have this recurring dream.
Sammy and I think that will be their next score. Who's the loner? First time we've seen him. We're not on him yet. Get on it.
I don't want to either. Neither do I. You know, I have this recurring dream. I'm sitting at this big banquet table and... all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are there... and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs... because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds. And there they are, these big balloon people... because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.
And what was the institute before it was the institute? Is life sketching a more subtle sketch than I? Here they find the things Fräulein Benjamenta teaches us... worth knowing. It isn't much and we are always revising. But perhaps there is some hidden meaning to all these nothings.
The high price of bread in France is an old grievance. But now the many deprivations, coming all together, whether these be bread or fuel and warm clothes for the dreadful winter, are judged by the populace to be insupportable. Once the French people get started, they then go to it with gloves on. Their wrath has found an object in the person of the queen, who devotes herself to her amusements, indulging in every current fancy and delusion. She welcomes fashionable charlatans, like the dangerous Dr Mesmer, and allows them intimacies, such as freedom to touch the royal person, that not so long ago would have condemned them to the rack.
He is now an exile in England. The people are making their voice heard. There's nothing to fear in the triumph of the people. Not even you are safe any more. Come away!
There are some incidents of violence, mainly due to the continued shortage of bread, so that grain speculators are frequent victims. Yet, I will agree to be stoned as a false prophet if all does not end well in this country. I fear it is what in England you would call rather silly, but for us it's a beautiful new thought, that the flower of the poor potato is more valuable than our finest jewellery. Thank you, Adrienne. Perhaps you don't understand the deep affinity between us and the people.
It is not easy to leave everything behind, go to a strange country. An émigré, a refugee. Without money or connection or friends. So one persuades oneself that everything will turn out well. On Tuesday last, a crowd of women, in a direct approach to the king and queen to help them feed their children, marched to Versailles and forced the royal family to return with them to Paris. The Marquis de Lafayette, as commander of the new National Guard, had the duty of escort. The people hope that the presence of the king in their midst will help relieve their desperate situation.
Hot corn. You must try our corn. Pick it up and eat it with your hands. It's like with all your Frenchie guests when we cook it for 'em. They love our corn!
You don't know nothin'! Old Master, he never gonna marry again. I was there when he do promise Mrs Jefferson on her deathbed. White folks' promises. They keep 'em when they make 'em to other white folk.
Certainly not difficult to unlearn. Tell me about America. Madam, the subject is as large as the land itself. England is so small. Even the sky is small.
He will be heartbroken. I don't think we need fear for Mr Jefferson's heart. But he has one, believe me. A great and tender heart. He wears it under a suit of armour.
Now you've listened to this madness perhaps we can go back to the way things were, the way things ought to be. Yes, I'm sure you'd like that. But dreams do not change what happened at Shechem or with the lambs in the fields. Dreams do not change my decisions. I'm sending you to see how the flocks are doing, not to a feast.
Son, you're getting older, bigger and where once your brothers might resent you as you gain strength and position, they begin to feel very threatened by you. I want you to try and make peace with them. Yes, Father. That's also what I want, but sometimes their anger is... Time will ease that if you're more careful of their feelings.
Missing. Pharaoh's seers and prognosticators say that one of these two is the culprit. Then their lives are over. Probably. But you never know what can happen.
They're not alone. Strange dreams. Full of signs. As soon as I learned of this, I came myself because I know of your gift for reading the messages of the night. Redeem yourself by interpreting for them.
Starvation kills us all. Unless... Well, Hirah, my old friend and ally says the reports of vast stocks of grain and fodder in Egypt are true. Which is all well and good for the Egyptians, but why should they care what happens to us? - They don't.
Because my anger was stronger than my compassion. And what will you do with them? My father's people are in need of food. I must send them back. Why not just reveal yourself to them.
Another month and we'll not talk of anything. Soon we will all die and the line started by Abraham will have vanished. And what would you have me do? Listen for once. Think about what God promised you.
It's all right. You must take better care of yourself. You don't need to be doing this heavy work. It's better that I work. There's enough anger boiling under the surface.
Why can no one see into the world beyond! My friends embrace me, They have pressed their hearts to my heart; How happy the soul is in me! Later I found out:
My friends embrace me, They have pressed their hearts to my heart; How happy the soul is in me! Later I found out: why do they embrace me?
There is grief here, but in the pleasures. Of merriment the blood bubbles. in a short time I shall leave joy and pain. The flower is now in my button hole. And if the world greens again
I have leafed through history and I have come to the end, And what is the history of man? A river of blood, which Long ago came forth from the fog-lost boulders. And in one length, without an interruption, flows down to our time. Do not believe that it has now stopped.
He hobbles into a Nearby saloon And drinks, in his grief, Like a brush maker! When the night comes And the clouds start to disperse You can see him with his red face As he crashes from the sky. Why do you look into my room, Inquisitive moon?
But he cannot Speak of it, Don't ask him... He forgets By the time he comes to. What happens to the chuckle, What happens to the sigh, When their sound's perished?
Thank you, Alan. Oh, my God! How could you do that? It's the law of the jungle, Sarah. You'll get used to it. And I think of all the energy I spent visualizing you as a radiant spirit. Go on, read it.
Oh, my. I'm so sorry. How terribly awful. It's okay. We barely even knew our parents. They were always away... skiing in Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo... safariing in darkest Africa.
How terribly awful. It's okay. We barely even knew our parents. They were always away... skiing in Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo... safariing in darkest Africa. We didn't even know if they loved us.
My dad used to make shoes here. They were the best shoes in New England. Sorry. Easy, girl. Do you know what happened to this shoe factory?
- Go ahead and ask him. - Ask him! - Yo. I got a '93 Infinity. It's fully loaded. Fully loaded. - Oh, yeah?
They'd think we're nuts. We are nuts. It's our play, Johnny. It's up to us. Why don't we just get some dynamite and blow the shit out of the pig? Brute force isn't the answer, man.
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I? This New World's going to be great, John. I'm going to get a pile of gold, build me a big house, and if any Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him. Just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas. - Leave the savages to me.
Yeah? Why is everybody so afraid of them? Well, I'm not afraid of him. You go with Wade, stay with her in the room while Remmy and I do a little recon. Checkmate. Hey, Q-Ball, why don't we just get on out of town, leave these geeks behind?
Well, I'm not afraid of him. You go with Wade, stay with her in the room while Remmy and I do a little recon. Checkmate. Hey, Q-Ball, why don't we just get on out of town, leave these geeks behind? Because if they can invade a person's dreams, running away won't do any good.
I'm sorry. (Cardoza) You invite me into your dream and not complete it is bad form, Gerald. Perhaps you're not the man I thought you were. But I am, sir. I am. Just tell me what it is you want me to do. I chose the pentagram as our symbol because it instills terror in all who see it.
The Dream Masters? Yes. She's fully engaged, level three. What about Q-Ball? I don't know, but he better get here soon. Shaman often carry a powerful object with them into the dream.
I'm... I'm sorry. (Cardoza) You invite me into your dream and not complete it is bad form, Gerald. Perhaps you're not the man I thought you were. But I am, sir. I am. Just tell me what it is you want me to do.
I brought the timer into your town. Banish me. If they're truly innocent, God will know and spare them. You're barbarians. Even savages would have shown us some hospitality.
It's okay. She's one of us. Um, give him the note. Take that to Reed. Tell him that if he finds three men in the desert to take them in.
It's just a tornado. Don't be worried, domnule Brown. The lodestone will protect us. The electrically charged tornado cannot enter this place. It's getting closer, profesore.
Don't insult me by saying you can explain. You realize I will have to make an example of the both of you. Take them back to the house. Hei, let me haide. The timer is what allows us to travel through to parallel worlds.
George Bush must've been re-eIected here. Who's the guy in the hat? Sam Houston, first president of the republic of Texas. It scares me that you know that. They've got a stock ticker hanging overthe bar.
Let me help you. ( burps ) Oh, man. - what have you been drinking? I'm wild bill Hickok, and every two-bit gunsIinger in the town wants a piece of me. You were in another gunfight?
He had developed a computer program so advanced... it would replace the public schools and save the taxpayers billions. But now- I don't know what I'm going to tell these people. Why don't you just tell them the truth? You have to understand the big picture.
Do you have any idea what you weigh? Wow, talk about your déjà vu. We've landed in a world almost identical to the last. Yeah, I've seen her before. No bearded women. That's a step in the right direction.
Damn, "Dragnet; The Next Generation." Even the TV cops wear kilts. What's that mean, everybody's from Scotland? Well, that's quite possible. The Scots are a notoriously dour and repressive people.
Fine. You coming? Miss Wells, this is emotional blackmail. Okay, let's back it up to the motel for a minute. This man and woman who confronted you-
Don't even try and understand. It'll give you a headache. Time's a-wasting, girl. We have to get out of here. What about this chip?
Excuse me, madam. May I have a moment of your time? You are Cardassian. That's right, and on behalf of my people I'd like to learn if there were any survivors after our attack on your homeland. Cardassian survivors? Yes. There were no Cardassian survivors.
Odo... give me your hand. Don't be afraid. Amazing. Feeling better? Yes, though I still have to concentrate to hold my form.
Yes, mine, too. Even with my eyes closed I would still know where everything was. Exactly. I would not tolerate it any other way. I'll tell you what else to do.
Oh, well, we'll just, uh, slip in. I'll stay for a few minutes, and then we'll slip out. With all due respect, sir, now that you're First Minister you can't slip in or out of bed without people noticing. Maybe not, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stay in bed all day. Odo to Worf. There's been a change of plans.
I won't, sir. That's all I need to hear. Now, no ships have been allowed to leave since this incident occurred. That means whoever was responsible is still on the station. I want them found.
I've been meaning to ask you. Why don't you wear that belt anymore? I don't know. It didn't really serve a purpose. It's not as if I needed it to hold my pants up.
We even thought we could resist the Dominion. I see you've heard of them. Then take care not to defy them or your people will pay the same price we did. The Jem'Hadar destroyed our world as an example to others. Bring me Milani's child. More than anything, the Dominion wanted my people to bear the mark of their defiance.
I don't understand why you need people who've quickened to make your cure. Well, I need to chart the progress of the viral-- I'm sorry. Oh, you're still here. Yes. Well, I see the blight has spared you.
You! As you can see, we're very busy here-- station business. How did you do it? Do what? I ordered a glass of prune juice from the replicator in the Defiant's mess.
Since the evidence in this case is sufficient to warrant conviction, the investigation is over. Your job is to find the truth not obtain convictions. Truth. You want the truth? All right, the truth is that none of you would be accused... none of you would even be here... if the Bajorans weren't fighting the Cardassians.
I hope you realize you'll be facing some very serious charges when we get back. You wouldn't dare put one of the greatest heroes of the Klingon Empire into the brig. You are no hero to the Empire. I will be. I've been thinking about my statue in the Hall of Warriors.
My host at the time was Emony. She was on Earth judging a gymnastics competition. I had a feeling he'd become a doctor. He had the hands of a surgeon. I've scanned every deck. The bomb's not aboard the ship.
It's a futile exercise anyway. Judges always accept what the police say, evidence or not. My god, in the '70s the coppers used to just phone it in from the pub. Yes, all right, Habib. You're not on "have I got news for you now," you know. Goodness how I deplore this modern habit Of running down our national institutions willy-nilly.
- Call off this Congressional investigation. - I can't. But Senator Sorenson is an honourable man. They are all honourable these honourable men. I heard Mulder was captured in Tunguska. I hear now he's escaped.
I watched the house for hours. I parked across the way, out over there. I was just casing. I wasn't planning for this to be the night. But then, all of a sudden, your parents leave, and I figure...
Harmonics level up twenty. What is this? Something's trying to get into my brain. Ayanami? Rei Ayanami?
I'm sure you're listening to this message, after I caused you so much trouble. Sorry. Please tell Rit-chan "I'm sorry". And there's one more thing to trouble you with. I've been growing flowers. I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me.
You must know somewhere? Where is your town? Prague. The wallpaper's pretty, it goes with the bedspread and the carpet is nice and thick.
Piss off. Congratulations! You can all drool with jealousy. I'm not going to Brussels. Ciao!
Go on telling me about your country. What can I tell you? That my life now is as empty as this glass? Define empty. This glass isn't an empty set.
- Are you sure, senor? - Yes, thank you, Paco Mom, why are you bringing my inheritance into this? You still haven't changed? - No, not you, mom
- We've done all our talking, Wade. No, please don't. I'm sorry about your mother. I really liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer.
Watch the snow. It's coming down tonight. This weather any advantage in tracking the bastards? Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Right about now, the does are holding up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind the does. We're right behind the bucks. That gun gets fired before 10:00.
Everyone should have a dog. Burning. Don't. I really love you. Don't.

Down in the Coto Donana they've killed... They've killed my dog. A deer among the green rock rose, he was following. Throughout all of Andalusia you'll never find another dog like my dog. Dogs!
I'm leaving in a few days. I suppose we won't meet again. In order to forget Elena, I got a job, and started reading the Bible again, as I did in jail. On the first day, God created the night so that lovers couldn't sleep.
-Hello. -Hello. Is your house that way? Our home is this way. What pretty shoes!
Excuse me ma'am, can I leave now? Why are you in a hurry? You may go. What is it, dear? Why are you sitting here?
Right. And she's weird too. -All right. But, you know, you're just giving me easy examples. All right. Ms. Lewis. Bosoms like melons that have been in the store a little too long.
Gave my penis an electric shock. You didn't like that? No, you don't understand, okay? I can't get it up anymore. It doesn't work. Just leave it alone for a little while.
What the fuck are you talking about? - Violence is dead. - No, no, no, no, no. Let me tell you something, friend. Violence is bigger than ever.
Movies, murder. I was gonna segue into it from there. Crafty. Med school. Clinical psych.
You were good. You'll get another break. Define "break." I guess sometimes your friends are really your enemies. Sometimes your enemies are your friends.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly the stupid actress... who stands at the edge of the cliff screaming for help. You're the stupid stuntwoman who jumps off the cliff. This is a lot more dangerous than the cliff. Define "dangerous." It comes up fast... and... you see those two guys over there?
Seeds of violence got through the night shoot, but there was an accident with one of the stunts. - Cat, the stuntwoman for daisy, got hurt in the explosion. - How is she? She cut her face and got banged up, but she's fine. Did we get the shot?
Good. No. Mike's discovered a lot of people. He sees something in them no one else sees. He believes in them.
I want to share with you a line from one of my unproduced plays. ""The amazing thing about a parent"s love is that something so large... ""...can so often go unseen."" -That"s beautiful. -Thank you. What do your sons look like?
What"s the point? The point.... The point is that parents screw up sometimes. They don"t mean it. They make mistakes because they"re human beings.
Will you show me how to use it? I'll show you everything I know. - Bye, guys. - What are you doing? - Making a call.
What do they want? They are demanding the dismissal of Mr Brown on grounds of drunkenness. You wish to see me, ma'am? My husband tried always to make me think more subtly. Of course, he taught me so much, and I can never repay my debt to him... or the love I feel even now.
It was before. Yes. Yes, it was. My ministers are as impertinent as ever. Dispatches so numerous they come in a trunk.
- Congratulations, Prime Minister. - Thank you. Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was right. This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.
What does he know about the Highlands? He has been attending at Balmoral for many years. Well, that hardly makes him an expert. His remarks were directed at the quality of writing, not at subject. I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others.
[Albert] And so there he is, Arthur O'Conner, all seven stone of the man, paddling madly towards us through a sea of horse guards, waving something that looks vaguely like a pen! - I thought he must be one of Mother's ardent readership... in search of the royal indenture. [Laughter] I believe I saw him first, and then I alerted Brown. I'm not convinced that he wasn't taking a snooze on top of the steps. - [Laughing] - So we had our man pinned down, and I must say that Brown acquitted himself admirably.
I never want to go through anything like that ever again. You know, wouldn't it be cool if our parents never came back? - Do you think it could happen? - Nah, I'm just saying what if. Yeah. Well, I don't think I'd miss them that much.
That's weird. Okay. - They say our moms never made it. - You're kidding. - No. - Okay, well, then let's just call our dads.
But they can step on us. Boys? - Well, they gotta be here somewhere. - Hey, this thing is on. - Don't be silly. A joint committee of the FD A and myself have told Wayne... that he is never to use the shrinking machine for the rest of his natural life.
I'm not looking down. But I am a cat. I am a panther. I am scared stiff. Okay, follow me.
Your luggage arrived before you. Good. I've nearly been here before. It reminds me of a hotel on the west cost where we stay when we visit my in-laws. One morning we woke up with a couple standing in our room.
-What is it like in the winter? -The opposite, completely dark. Take it easy. -The light was red. -lt was green.
We are that, Holiness. My army and the Khambas, they fight with almost nothing. No airplanes. No trucks. No weapons. No one can stop them. Not even me. They fight for you, Holiness.
We've managed the Chinese for many years. These are not the Chinese we know, Holiness. These are Communists. The Fifth Dalai Lama joined an alliance with the Chinese. And a great spiritual revolution began in the East.
It will be as you say, Holiness. I need to know what you know now. I'm no longer a child. And so, Mao Tse-tung has called for all-out war. He will settle for nothing less than a red China.
Luckily, there's an easy way to find out the truth. I'm not the one under suspicion here. I'd say you are, Ken. Got some hard evidence, as the saying goes. What's on that tape isn't a felony.
There was no-one else like me. Eventually the trail went cold and dead. And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley. "Dear Dad, how's everything?" "I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."
Quick! Don't touch the body! It'll draw your life into it! One head, as promised. Milady!
Died in Vietnam 30 years ago. What is going on? Haven't you ever been framed? Do the math. A former marine sniper assassinates the first lady.
Thanks a lot. That was the hospital. I had a friend run a patent search on C.R.C. -13. The patent was registered to Bickhart Pharmaceuticals... bioweapons division. If you spent as much money on security as cigars... you'd live longer. Your dogs are underfed.
Do you know what I mean? I think so. So, sometimes... Could you excuse us, please? Sometimes people think they know how they feel about each other.
- I guess that's it. - To the bride and groom Now let's hear from the maid of honour, the lovely Julianne. I had the strangest dream. I dreamed that some psychopath was trying to break you two up.
Give me some bullets, I'll take care of it! If you move into the inn, I can move in here! I can't stand my two women! I'll take your house! Our ancestors would banish the  <hon>sinners<hoff>, make an end to misfortune!
His hair - who does he take after? Why can't we live peacefully? Stop drinking! This pancake of dirt is our earth. The sea licks it like a sugar cube.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies, this is the new night watchman. - What's your name again? - Martin Bells. Deputy Inspector Bill Davies. Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill.
- What's your name again? - Martin Bells. Deputy Inspector Bill Davies. Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill. Most people, when they see something like this, their immediate reaction is to ask, "How could somebody do this and why?"
Then you call the duty doctor from the guard's station. He'll be here in five minutes. Don't worry. It'll never happen. It's cold in here, but you can still smell 'em, can't you? Make sure the door doesn't close. No handle on the inside.
It isn't much, but it holds a portrait of my dear mother. Goodness is rewarded. Remember that, my son, and live by it. If I'd lived by those words, I wouldn't have come to such an end. Keep this locket with you always.
Put that in for me. Daisy, I made a mess here. Pick that up, huh? What happens when you go to court? I haven't got caught.
Is there any way we could... Do you have to give him everything? - He's got a lot of overhead. His jet is getting old. Just draw it up the way I asked, and bring it back so I can review it.
Sure. I'll show you the way. These lawyers get $1,000 an hour, and I hate them. From their lofty perch, pissing down on the justice system with disdain. I used to hate them because I wasn't good enough for them.
I thought... -I asked Margo to join us, Ann. -I hope you don't mind. -Oh, no. Of course not. No word from John yet, but these crates arrived this morning.
-You checked the manifest? -We're doing it now. -Bring in the dogs? -The drug unit's been over the whole thing. I told them it was a waste of time. I mean, this was obviously a drug hit.
-Bring in the dogs? -The drug unit's been over the whole thing. I told them it was a waste of time. I mean, this was obviously a drug hit. Whatever they came for, they found.
-You farted, didn't you? No, not lately. Let's get out of here. That's terrific. Hang on to your fucking hat, Lieutenant.
It ate those leaves, and it changed into whatever it is now. Into what we just saw. You're not crazy, Margo. Don't you see, girl? It's the Callisto Effect. It's really true. The Kothoga myth was based on fact.
4%. 2%... Hey, wait a minute. Hemidactylus turcicus 45%? -It's a gecko, same as the beetle. -What are you talking about?
How the hell does something like that fit inside one of them? In those crates that Whitney sent back, the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen that carried a parasitic fungus. The fungus was loaded with hormones, animal hormones that are produced in the thalamoid region of the human brain. -You mean the hypothalamus. -I know this is crazy, but maybe this animal started out as something else, a chameleon, a lizard, maybe even a dog.
Good, I will come by. The teacher confirmed and set off with his class screaming again. K. was distracted and irritated by this conversation. For the first time he felt tired. For the state that he was in, just forcing himself to reach the Castle entrance, would have been enough.
You? No, I am Jeremias. Good. Doesn't matter. Both of you will be Arthur.
Why should we send them little girls to America? They're not ordinary little girls They're Charlie Soong's daughters New women of new China Ones who will do great things
Quick Run Where is Sun Yat-sen? Stop the machines It's so noisy how can our officers hear anything?
And Yat-sen doesn't know either What is it? The doctor said I'll never have children again, ever Sir, I think you can no longer count on these warlords They can turn against you at any time
Madam, if you're not ready don't force it I am ready Here come Madam Sun Gentlemen Some leaders of the Nationalist Party are working against Dr Sun's will
Rico. Pay attention. Sorry, Mr. Rasczak. Let's sum up. This year we explored... the failure of Democracy, how the social scientists brought our world... to the brink of chaos.
Ha! We humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it just isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It reproduces in vast numbers... has no ego, has no fear... doesn't know about death... and, so, is the perfect, selfless member of society. But humans have created art, mathematics, and interstellar travel. True, but before you let that go to your head... take the example of the Arachnids... a highly evolved insect society.
These people are crazy. They're probably scared too. - They're going to kill us. - We don't know that. They haven't killed us yet, right?
The government puts people with supernatural powers on an island. I'm serious. If I was a politician, the last thing I'd want is some fucker who could read minds. Gordon gets it. So the people just go away and never come back?
Gordon gets it. So the people just go away and never come back? First, they want to see you. Make sure you've got the real goods. Then your ass is theirs.
What the fuck are you doing? You think this is cool? No. - Why are you kissing everybody's ass? - I'm not.
No fires, no explosions, no continuing threat. We'll copy you on a report. Steam did that? Yeah. Where's the survivor?
- Maybe the earthquake tore something out. - Shit. - Let's find out before we... You're only happy declaring an emergency! No, I actually enjoy motor sports, music and the company of close friends,... sir.
Oh, Jesus. - There she is. - Looks like we got a hell of a fire, Stan. Yeah, we sure do. Right, let's go, let's go, double time!
- Did we just beat this bastard? - It looks like it! Flood control! Ladies and gentlemen, it is a miracle. And look at the faces of these people. Look at these guys!
City officials won'tsayif it has anything to do with the deaths today of those seven public workers. Take a look at this. OK. Um, what am I looking at? That lake was 62 degrees yesterday.
When he came to Tao, he taught ways of peace and harmony. But it didn't last. Komodo began mining the Lif espring f or a mineral called zubrium. The Lif esprings are where we live. They radiate energy to all of Tao.
There are gypsy colonels, majors and captains in the army! There are lawyers and state prosecutors! There's no difference between the two of them in France. French people and gypsies live in perfect harmony. In France, no one calls gypsies thieves. No one points the finger at them in France!
- Here, drink up! You have to drink! May you drop dead, may you die... if you don't drink to the health of my son, Adriani! To sleep. We're not going to sleep tonight! I'm a poor father... so unhappy... Come on, it's snowing. ..that I'd go into mourning for water...
The flesh is weak, beloved nephew, And you, what about you? Do you like girls? Well, it depends Yeah, of course, then take some advice, son be careful with women
Try it, close your eyes, and wonder. What do you see? I see my parents at Madrid I'm awake in bed I can not sleep And so?
I see my parents at Madrid I'm awake in bed I can not sleep And so? Your parents have separated because they don't get along And so?
Do not worry, not worth it. I'm fine here I am an elephant, Antonico. An elephant? If he says it's an elephant, then that's it.
You, Lord, you're the only saint and the only one infinitely merciful How you've grown, Manu! How handsome you are, you look like a man. ... and do not let eternal King, who in baptism was incorporated into your church, look away from you but by your glorious merits grant them the place of light, happiness and peace, You who live and reign forever and ever, amen. Suddenly I realized that the arrival of my parents had destroyed something
Because our patients deserve the best results. Some of his work was... I felt that I could not stand behind him. When I came up with the implant idea, he had trouble even saying "breast." Thank you.
I forgot, I don't know what it is. I don't know. - We're gonna take a break... - It's a bunch of bullshit. If you have silicone breast implants and are experiencing these symptoms... please call 1-800-RUPTURE.
I've developed a new aufricht retractor. Did you find the old one inadequate? Anybody sitting here? - No, by all means. - Thank you.
We could advertise in the newspaper. Newspaper? Look, this is the ad I've been working on. You're gonna advertise my ruined career and reputation? That's very interesting, but... you know, doctors never advertise.
I'm sorry. Could you hold on, please? You have 36 cancellations this week and two death threats, one sounds serious. The Times, Tribune, Post, and Sun want to speak with you. Channels 2, 4, 5 and 11 all want you on the news tonight.
I'm going on record right now... and saying that science can be bought today. Take a good look at that. That's what an explanted silicone implant looks like. Brought to you by the same people who brought you Agent Orange. Lawyers don't give a damn about women.
That's what an explanted silicone implant looks like. Brought to you by the same people who brought you Agent Orange. Lawyers don't give a damn about women. Money comes in, they knock them out of the way to get their 50 percent first. I do blame Dr. Saunders and I do blame Dr. Larson!
I run my own company, I've got a nice house... I feel breasts are the real basis of femininity. - I can get my stomach flatter at the gym. - It's not the same as a penis. They have form and function based on the concept of giving.
What a head I had! Professor Helmer is coming. Just like that! What is this? Do the alcoholics from other wards send you beer?
How vexing! He´s gone. No, he´s taken the lift. He´s getting off at Neurosurgery. The evil could be me.
That's it! The miracle of God Oh, damn you, Guard I am right in the middle of the road and you are shooting bullets at me Raja Saheb has given us orders to shoot
D.I.G., have you heard? about Shankars unfaithfulness That's why I've brought these commandos They will hunt him out of the jungle like hungry wolves Hey, Birjwa!
Look at my father coming here with such a long face Father, why are you looking so glum? Father, you are looking very worried Come on, tell me Son, you were right that day
A lot of our people shot at the soldiers who fled. ISIDRO and MANUEL Allende's ex-bodyguards They came back via Morandé street. Here, they're running inside. There, that's before the shooting.
Sir, what is your position regarding the elections? For Popular Unity to get at least 20%. I think it's a referendum matter. On Sunday, Chile will make its choice between Marxism and freedom. If we understand... that at this hour, the essentials are... to consolidate the government in its policies and to give ourselves the tools, to make sure that there's flexibility at an institutional level,
Rich people sent their money abroad. Why do you think there was nothing to eat? Giving money to the poor: that's easy to say. The people had no way to make themselves heard.
I had organised the whole thing. They took the film reels to Valparaiso... and they were checked by the police several times. The driver told me they were terrified. At Valparaiso, the soldiers didn't want to allow the luggage to be embarked. Luckily, the ship's captain told them it was a diplomatic suitcase
You were the next patient in line. I don't remember if we hugged but we at least had a handshake. Was I very frightened? No. I remember what you said to me that you had participated in mock executions.
When we grow up, we'll get married. After getting married, we'll give birth to our next generation. So we must mate. All animals on earth must mate to have next generation. This is very natural. Don't be shy, don't think that is dirty.
How old was she when you met her? She was 8. I'll go back to work. Happy birthday to you. Where's my birthday present?
She was 8. I'll go back to work. Happy birthday to you. Where's my birthday present? This story teaches us one thing, it teaches us...
I'll go back to work. Happy birthday to you. Where's my birthday present? This story teaches us one thing, it teaches us... What does it teach us...
It's eating... the Angel. The S2 engine... she's taking it into herself! The bindings! What bindings?
Sorry. Please tell Ritsu I'm sorry, too. And there's one more thing to trouble you with... I've been growing melons. I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me.
Berserker! We've done it. It's an AT field! Unit 0 1 is expanding it's own AT field. It's neutralizing the phase space!
Shinji! It's been raining for the past 4 days in a row. Work on the sample analysis has been postponed due to the weather. Other than that, nothing else to write about. Well, the sun finally came out for a while today.
Here is Anne who's just seen a whale, and so we're going to try to find it and see it. I was brushing my teeth... when I heard the bell for cetaceans, and so we're trying to see if there's a whale. We can see them... There's two of them. What does it mean when they do that?
That's true. It may well happen, and as we know, in many places nature is deeply affected by human activity. There's a threshold not to be exceeded, undoubtedly? If it exceeds a certain threshold, indeed, as you say, you could see an entire ecosystem disappear forever. But when you think about it, one could say that nature is us, so living in harmony with nature, wouldn't it be living in harmony with ourselves?
-We'll get a bit closer. According to our guide, these ruins are those of a plantation called Yankee Town. On land, the heat is overwhelming. The only inhabitant of Yankee Town is a fish eagle. What could bring men to live on this barren island, 1000 km from the Mainland?
On land, the heat is overwhelming. The only inhabitant of Yankee Town is a fish eagle. What could bring men to live on this barren island, 1000 km from the Mainland? So they say that the Loyalists who were Americans... who fought for Britain during the war of Independence... came here because they were banished. They worked here by planting cotton and sugar for about 30 years.
And it's very practical. I'm really happy. It totally excites my curiosity. I want to... to search the entire island. It already feels weird to think... that I'm at a place that people have already walked, a very long time ago.
Motorboats have replaced the Indian canoes, but the method of fishing hasn't changed. It's by free diving that the inhabitants of the Turks and Caicos Islands... collect the conch. These divers are extremely efficient. 2 hours are enough for them to fill the boat to the brim. They swim and swim and swim for kms...
It's by free diving that the inhabitants of the Turks and Caicos Islands... collect the conch. These divers are extremely efficient. 2 hours are enough for them to fill the boat to the brim. They swim and swim and swim for kms... They go down, they take their conch.
We don't even have an engine, we have sails, as the ancients did. We haven't yet made the step toward modern technology. Can we take a look at the boat? Yes, you can, because you're welcome. When some sailors are on watch, others can use the berths.
We haven't yet made the step toward modern technology. Can we take a look at the boat? Yes, you can, because you're welcome. When some sailors are on watch, others can use the berths. They work all night and sometimes when they're tired, they sleep there.
We find in this friendly and cultured man, an ardent defender of the environment, much threatened on his island. I didn't know when I met you... if you'd be interested in such a question. perhaps something brought us here to meet you. There are people like me who take care of the environment. However, it's a problem which concerns everybody, every country. Ah yes, because the environment, in fact it's life. The Earth, it's our mother planet and we're all brothers.
So I stay. To protect Ray, the army has given him an armed guard. The main threat comes from local fishermen. Having exhausted fish stocks outside the park, they're forced into poverty and are desperate... to plunder the reefs that Ray protects. I think very much of the fishermen and their children.

Having exhausted fish stocks outside the park, they're forced into poverty and are desperate... to plunder the reefs that Ray protects. I think very much of the fishermen and their children. They go hungry now because they don't have enough to eat.
But this isn't possible because corals are animals and therefore consume O2. Well, in principle, yes, animals consume oxygen. They breathe like you and me. But you know, we spoke about it previously, that corals have formed an association with a small algae, called the zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live in the same tissue, the animal tissue of the coral.
-Oh, yes. -There's something like that, there... We need to look at it. This small jellyfish is a coral polyp. Coral consists of small animals of the family of jellyfish and sea anemones.
I didn't know that such a place existed. The Exuma national park is 25 km long. It includes dozens of unspoilt islands. This animal sanctuary can repopulate the archipelago in fish, lobsters and shellfish. But this preserved environment attracts a growing number of visitors.
This is a rib. So here's the shoulder blades. This one is heavier than the others. The vertebrae are larger than our heads. Wait for me.
Yeah, his eyes glowed. That was our first clue. Are you sure he's dead, Colonel? Unless he could survive a tactical nuclear warhead blown up in his face,... ..positive. Why?
The object should now be through the Abydos Stargate. - Now what? - Now we wait. If Daniel's around, he'll know what the message means. What if the aliens get it?
Six hostile aliens came through the Stargate on Earth. Four people are dead, one's missing. One of them looked like Ra, Daniel. Well, they didn't come from here. The boys take shifts guarding it 36 hours a day, every day.
Four people are dead, one's missing. One of them looked like Ra, Daniel. Well, they didn't come from here. The boys take shifts guarding it 36 hours a day, every day. We'd know if they came through here.
Then you won't mind if I authorise a go- ahead on our plan. This quartz material the Stargates are made of... ..must be tough stuff if it can withstand a Mark 3. We sent a robot probe through after we got back, sir. It was flattened on the other end. Obviously, the Abydos Stargate had been buried in the rubble.
- Thank you. - It is plain, but nourishing. I didn't mean for the soup. You must think I am fool for helping you. I think you're very brave.
It doesn't matter which side wins this today. A thousand years from now, it'll start all over again. You're as trapped in this cycle as much as we are. But we can't afford it anymore. We don't need it. We don't need you. We've learned how to stand on our own.
Open. - I've got it! Damn it, Susan, I've got it! - What? Look, if they want to play games, well, fine. We can play games too only we can play them better because we've got the truth on our side. You can't kill the truth.
Their presence along the border will help keep us safe in case we once again descend into the chaos of civil war. The Drakh want peaceful relations. They want only a place to have for their own because... Because they have just lost their home. There was an evacuation, some kind of natural disaster, they said.
There is a rumor going around that our request for recognition has been turned down yet again by Rome. Yes, I see. A better rationale for the vow of silence I've never heard. Is it true? The ways of Rome are like unto God.
If your assumption is correct where did Sheridan and Delenn and those involved go wrong? Where do you start? So many people died in the year after Sheridan and Delenn returned to Babylon 5. - You can't blame them for all that. - Of course you can.
And that's our strength. But what kind of world would we have, what options for happiness... would we have in a society run by telepaths... where ordinary humans are considered second-class citizens... and privacy is something you don't even risk dreaming about? Would you like to live in that kind of world, Mr. Garibaldi? No. No, I wouldn't. But you know it's coming, don't you?
Would you like to live in that kind of world, Mr. Garibaldi? No. No, I wouldn't. But you know it's coming, don't you? There are a few Psi Cops who think they should run the show... but they don't have anywhere near the kind of power to pull off anything like this. Not yet, but that's changing.
Clark wanted power. I don't have a problem with that. No one but a fool ever walked away from real power. But he began taking unacceptable risks. He eliminated Santiago with outside help.
He knew they were interested in the Psi Corps. And if they were interested, then he was interested. They were his insurance policy against the aliens... and his means for gaining more power. He created the Nightwatch... started putting his people into important positions... with telepaths alongside for security. He gave them unprecedented authority.
- He still thinks he's in charge. - Isn't he? Megacorporations have been running things for years. We just don't show ourselves much. People wouldn't understand.
I'd like to know how you did it. I was just looking at him and I heard a sound in my head. What kind of sound? Well, it's... I don't even know if you're gonna believe me.
Anyone want to tell me how we're supposed to stop that? We are outclassed, boys and girls. If we knew where either side was gonna hit next... That is what I've been trying to say. Our ships have seen the Vorlon fleet massing in hyperspace.
- If there were any other way... - Understood. We'll put up a good fight. If there's anything that you or your crew need anyone you want us to get ahold of... They're Minbari, captain.
Captain, it's only 10 light-minutes from one of their main staging areas. They'd be able to counterattack almost instantly. We're aware of that. We're transmitting a file to you on a subchannel. That file contains information about a secret base we've established near Coriana 6.
I don't get it. Why would the bodyguard have such a jones for a broken piece of rock? Well, um... Perhaps he needs to put it together with the other pieces. If he has them. I mean, we didn't find them.
- ..do not kill me. - You are already dead. For 500 years. But it was not fair. I was innocent.
His parents say he never came home last night. I don't think I saw Rodney on the bus back from the field trip. I didn't either. I hope he didn't get in trouble at the museum. Hey, maybe he awakened the mummy.
Oh, no, my pet. This is just the beginning. - It's a secret. - What kind of a secret? The kind where I don't actually tell you what it is.
I'm sorry. I had no idea. But what you're doing is still very wrong. You try vomiting for 24 hours because the pain in your head is so intense... ..and then... we'll discuss the concept of right and wrong. These people are sheep.
I'm not? Quinn, maybe you better take it easy for awhile. Spirit animal! Come back, spirit animal! Girls, have you seen your father's spirit animal?
Cryptococcus. You were right. Randi, have you seen a black binder? The nursing budget? It fell out of the cubby, so I looked at it.
You changed the stone in my ring. Where is my grandmother's diamond? Just like Grandma. Gone. -You threw it out?
How long has this been going on? Three weeks. Look at you. Oh, my God! You've been lying to me my whole life, haven't you? "Raymond, you're such a great writer, you could've been writing poetry."
Three weeks. Look at you. Oh, my God! You've been lying to me my whole life, haven't you? "Raymond, you're such a great writer, you could've been writing poetry." How about in high school, Ma? "Don't worry, the girls don't know what they're missing." They knew!
-That's alarming. I really enjoyed the piece. A terrific piece. You did a great job-- Oh, thanks. Thanks, Roy. When a program succeeds like that... a Iot of that stuffjust gets swept right under the rug.
I really enjoyed the piece. A terrific piece. You did a great job-- Oh, thanks. Thanks, Roy. When a program succeeds like that... a Iot of that stuffjust gets swept right under the rug. -Right. -Yeah. And what's going to happen is that it's later... that these kids are going to realize that... they've made a horrible mistake, you know.
We were swamped with bodies. Captain Orser assigned Petty Officer Harridan to me. He was there to oversee everything. When Captain Orser wasn't too busy performing seven autopsies? Objection. Is this going anywhere, Your Honour?
The American government won't stand by and allow one of its citizens to be held illegally. What do you think they're going to say? "Crivens, you caught us. Here's the kid?" They don't admit to their own treachery. They won't admit to this. Jimmy's as good as dead if it comes to that.
And he'll need a parent left to raise him. God be with you, my love. I'll get him back, Lieutenant. Get them both back, sir. I apologize if there was a mistake, Doctor.
I'd sacrifice my life for Sarah, commander, but not my beliefs. Which belief is that, colonel? The one I heard on ZNN or a half a billion dollars? That's a damn lie, put out by the government to discredit me and you know it. Colonel, how did you know the Declaration was being moved?
He wishes he was with me. Yes, that's my friend Pfiger. Come, I have something to show you. You'll like it. Red Cell is giving the government 6 hours to accede to their demands.
Go get me more champagne, will ya honey? You are such a pig when you want to be- it's just all the time. You're a lucky man, Peter... a lucky man. Are we done with this job? Yup.
You're a lucky man, Peter... a lucky man. Are we done with this job? Yup. I guess your clients got what they wanted? Nah, it was a total waste of time. I knew it would be.
Yup. I guess your clients got what they wanted? Nah, it was a total waste of time. I knew it would be. They're foreigners, you know they don't understand, you don't get in John Wayne's face and tell him what to do. Fanatics, you know.
Come on, Al, you know the drill. We can't leave until you repeat the insult. Okay. Look who's crossed the road. I'd say it was a chicken, but it doesn't have any breasts just nuggets.

How you wanted it to be there. When I'm here, touching this earth... I sense it. I'm in that plane. I can't call it up, I can't control it, I can't understand it. I have an ability that I thought I'd lost.
They could really damage him. They could kill him with a single kick. - But they just stand there. - It's because they're reared to trust in man. I've seen horses trapped in the killing box at the slaughterhouse.
They could kill him with a single kick. - But they just stand there. - It's because they're reared to trust in man. I've seen horses trapped in the killing box at the slaughterhouse. They can smell the blood and the death of the animal that was in before them, but, despite that, they trust in man.

They can smell the blood and the death of the animal that was in before them, but, despite that, they trust in man. Their executioner's standing above them with a bolt gun, they look to him for help and he fires a steel bolt straight into their heads.
I'd like to have a look at the crime scene. - Mr Black, he killed an animal. - This time. My work normally begins with dead bodies. Multiples of dead bodies.
Exactly the same, base pair for base pair. Unless you buy an 18-billion-to-one shot, no way that could happen naturally. It's not like a gene for hair color. They're splicing multiple genes to control complex behavior. The Human Genome Project. The biggest science event since the moon shot.
They're splicing multiple genes to control complex behavior. The Human Genome Project. The biggest science event since the moon shot. Public records indicate they're not that far along. Technically the program's unclassified.
He fought the same fight we wage today. Did he have the knowledge that we lack? The knowledge to overcome the evils of the millennium. And did he have the foresight to pass that information on to us? Are these tattoos merely decorations?
Be human guinea pigs? Thousands of trials every year. - He blinded himself. - That's Oedipus, dear. With his own hands. I saw it.
- Better late than never! - You got that right! One child is dead. Another one is missing. Some of us know all too well the pain... of losing a child.
I mean, she must have a blueprint of the building or something. -Did you tell Peterman about this? -Well, I tried. But he thought it was some sort of a catfight. Catfight? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a catfight?
- Aye. Aye. Aye. Hello. Listen Lady. I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store.
Oh, man, am I glad to get out of there! Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes. Who cares? This is the best part of the week. It's the longest possible time before more church! Church shouldn't be a chore. It should help you in daily life.
Well, I think volunteering is great. Deep down it makes you feel... Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table! It came from the dump. But, Marge, I'm obsessed with it. Where did it come from?
It should not be more than a few days. Can I ask you about your dot? - What would you like to know? - What's the deal with that dot? Can you see out of it?
(Rembrandt) Are the women here exceptionally beautiful, or have I been sliding too long? These people have probably spent more time under the scalpel than they have the barbell. Yeah, they inject most chickens with hormones. It doesn't make that thigh any less enjoyable. Let's go. Come on. Hey, no!
Yeah, well, Maggie's not lost yet. But if you don't stop worrying about your ego and start focusing on finding her, she will be. Point taken. But this is a big city. Yeah, but we know that thing inside of her loves hot water and it craves steam.
- There's no such thing as UFOs! Let's get him to the morgue. Hey, wait till you guys see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass! Dude, it can't be cooler than mine! Hey, man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
Form groups and search the mountain! Report back here every hour! You got that? Mayor! I might have an idea. Oh, what? If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon.
I want you to get on the phone, and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911 and Entertainment Tonight. And you better get my stylist on the phone, too. Don't worry, things are under control. And then Ned picked up the grenade and boom! Blasted his arm clear off! We spent three hours looking for that damn arm. But it was never to be found.
It might not be so bad. For all we know the Vorta could be gluttonous, alcoholic sex maniacs. I never thought of that. I wonder what their favorite food is. Good news. The Starfleet task force under Admiral Gilhouly has entered Bajoran space.
I never thought of that. I wonder what their favorite food is. Good news. The Starfleet task force under Admiral Gilhouly has entered Bajoran space. Hope they know what they're in for.
Its shields are holding. How can that be? Looks like someone's been doing some modifications to the Yukon. I'm also picking up large amounts of trilithium tekasite and protomatter on board. A bomb.
He was our youngest and least experienced. I promise your next opponent will provide more of a challenge. View's even better from Upper Pylon 2. I keep hoping that the wormhole will open. That Garak's runabout will come through and everything will be all right again.
"Death to all." That was their motto. Three simple words and they certainly sum up their credo nicely. Why would the Cardassians abandon this station and leave behind a few soldiers in stasis tubes? Why do you think? To guard it. The tubes were probably rigged to wake them up as soon as someone came aboard.

The tubes were probably rigged to wake them up as soon as someone came aboard. Well, that's possible, but one thing's for sure... they're out there somewhere and considering what they did to the runabout
Why? I'm not sure, but I can tell you one thing... it wasn't to make him amicable. The drug's protein structure seems designed to amplify my people's xenophobic tendencies. My guess is that the soldiers that were left here were part of a Cardassian military experiment. The High Command was probably looking for a way to further motivate their troops.

My guess is that the soldiers that were left here were part of a Cardassian military experiment. The High Command was probably looking for a way to further motivate their troops. So they gave them a drug to make them hate anybody but Cardassians.
But I couldn't count on you, could I? All you've done is to doom us... both. Sorry I'm late. What's he doing here? Captain Sisko invited me.
A baby changeling? Mmm. Centuries ago, my people sent a hundred of us out into the galaxy so we could learn about other races. When I was found, I looked very much like this. You were this small?
I was in the resistance. Lupaza made me this... out of some of the metal from that skimmer. How were they killed? Someone attached a small hunter probe to the hull of a Talavian freighter. When the ship docked at the station the probe detached itself and then began a visual scan of every room in the Habitat Ring.
Well, it won't work. I'll never retract my claims. I'd rather go to prison than help you perpetuate ignorance! Your true scales are finally showing. You're right, Minister. I was mistaken.
I am detecting no ships, no structures, no weapon signatures. Wait a minute. Something. I see it, too. A subspace disruption. What's causing it?

Stand by for my orders. 4 Bio-Ships have just entered sensor range... Battle Stations - I've got a visual - On Screen
It took some digging through the Federation database, but I managed to find a single entry in the records of Deep Space 4. Her parents were... unconventional. They fancied themselves explorers, but wanted nothing to do with Starfleet or the Federation. Their names were last recorded at a remote outpost in the Omega Sector. They refused to file a flight plan.
She is heavily sedated. I assure you, she's not going anywhere. Thank you. Kes, I want you to anesthetize her cranial nerves. 20 milligrams anetrizine.
You might want to try it sometime. Are you suggesting that I create one of these holodeck programs? You might find it interesting. It's a way of exploring aspects of yourself that probably didn't fit into your life as a Borg-- imagination... creativity... fantasy... I am uncertain why these things are necessary.
- This case represents the many. - Well it shouldn't! Why? Why are you doin' this? When I look into Hanno's eyes,... I see the horror on the faces of many others,... as their loved ones prepare for Goa'uld absorption.
Hell, he's not even an Earth citizen. I don't believe I'm hearing this from you, sir. General Hammond, sir, if I may. Even setting aside that Teal'c is our friend,... how can you let such a valuable information resource be taken away? These people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
I saw movement as well. This way. I hope these things are as big as you say they are. There is enough tranquilizer in these darts to knock out a Rino. They are very large, but extremely maneuverable in the air.
I was trying to protect the boy. You protect his body after poisoning his mind. Will you listen to me? The reason the Goa'uld hunt those flying things is because they want to know how it's able to disappear, - Our ways have served us for as long as our people have lived.
You protect his body after poisoning his mind. Will you listen to me? The reason the Goa'uld hunt those flying things is because they want to know how it's able to disappear, - Our ways have served us for as long as our people have lived. But they didn't know you existed before.
- What kind of comparison is that? - Colonel, ...if one of those Goa'uld ships were coming here right now, ...have you brought back one thing we can fight them off with? What technology do you seek? You tell me, what's out there? There are still technologies even the Goa'uld seek.
Ohper is one of the oldest of the Nox. If Shak'I dose not die, ...they will be in even greeted danger then they are now. There will be no more death. I have no intention of killing him. However, if Shak'I dose survive his injuries he will tell the Goa'uld where to find you.
- Did you tell them how you were in love? - No! Did you show them your pictures? No. What do you think those girls thought of you, Harold?
And so will I. You know, I've got things to finish to prove to myself, to my family. But for my own reasons. Come on back. The truth will save you, Scully.
Hear me, cowards! I... We are your true enemies! We spit on your houses! We curse your names. We laugh at your ancestors.
Then, when they get together to kill us, we throw down our weapons and get them to join us in peace. Oh, come on! It's a great plan! Look, I've known lots of people who've bonded over their mutual hatred of me. -You two, for example. -Well, he's got a point.
-Especially the cash. The cash comes later after the conquering and general mayhem, you know? Meanwhile, chill! Pick out some hardware. Go kill a peasant. Relax. We are set for life.
You won't be once Lorenzo hears of this. Thank you for your assistance, Signora Franco. He's alive. You made many enemies today. They were already enemies.
This way, gentlemen. Don't be shy. Come in and meet the ladies. Did I not tell you they were beautiful? Don't you have any real women?
I'm a man of science, a man of learning... a man who knows how to buy the finest books. Fear will be our breakfast, and stark-raving terror our daily luncheon. Mr. Hunt? Mr. Hunt? I'd be more worried about the Indians than the bears.
I believe the men and I share a tremendous sense of excitement... and anticipation for what lies ahead. Thank you, Higgins. Your music will be a welcome companion on our long journey. Men, we'll be following the map of trapper Pierre LeBlanc... who explored the Missouri in 1792. Hunt, you've traversed most of these territories.
-You can do it. -Save yourself. I'll never forget this, Bartholomew. And now we kill you, senor, and take your head back to Hidalgo. But we do have one tiny favor to ask of you.
Because of Vigau's extraordinary growth during the past five years... I've proposed that we make a detailed census. Well, that would be interesting. But how is it a police matter? Modern law enforcement demands modern methods, and that means information. For example: How many people have moved here in the last decade? Where did they come from?
The king has declared that everything is a crime. Writing is a crime. Two weeks ago police destroyed the Égalité-- the workers' newspaper. They smashed the press. That man making the speech-- He's the leader of the A.B.C. Society-- the largest and most dangerous of the student groups. They want the king out. They want suffrage without limitation.
Wait a moment. My friend wants to know if you'll take a walk in the park with him. Here you are. Bring your babies back tomorrow and I'll give them jackets. He never leaves her alone. He's not a f ather.
- Marius Pontmercy. - Rents a room above the Cafe Musain. - Being poor is the worst crime of all. If you commit these crimes, you are condemned for life. Concentrate on him. Our government has no mercy, no pity, no forgiveness.
Aw, she'll never believe me. But I gotta try. Kiara, I... I need to talk to you. - Kiara, I don't want you talking with him. I want to talk with him.
You must've messed up the translation. I don't think so. If this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot. That's something to consider. A stupid alien. They must have them.
There's nobody left down here that knows how to run the place. Right? The fire screwed up the electronics. We've used up most of our reserve gas. You're reading your book.
I don't want to not be able to sleep, afraid I'll wake up having manifested some nightmare and there's all kinds of weird things in my apartment. That's a frightening thought. No kidding. So if we still have the power what do you want to do with it? God knows what they'll do with it.
Have one of those. Help yourself. That's her own special creation there- Deep-fried dietetic donuts... And so inedible, You won't be able to get enough of it down to be bad for you. Hey, this guy, uh... You know, this guy Baxter, He showed you his badge or anything?
So if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it? You tell us why we're here at the NASA Space Center. We should probably talk alone. Mr. Truman, I don't keep any secrets from my daughter, Grace. So whether you tell her now or I tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other. So why don't we just get on with it?
Ideas are very dangerous things. You are mindless, soil-shoving losers, put on this earth to serve us! You're wrong, Hopper. Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers! I've seen these ants do great things.
I'm 65 years old. Why would I want $40 million when I can settle for five and just kick back, Jack? My phone's been ringing, too, people wanting to buy this company outright. They've been offering me a lot of change to close her down. This office... what does it say outside?
Not unless they were trying to hide something. Take a look at this. You'd be surprised what you'd find with an active imagination and a little scraping. This means something to you. Shelburne was a code name my mother used as a CIA operative.
I mean, I get it. You were doing a really cute - thing and I messed it all up. - I was just... Baby, I'm sorry.
Let-Let's go for a walk and-and-and see if we find a new restaurant. Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park? LEONARD: No. All right.
A friend will read it to me later. May I? Thank you. It seems he doesn't need you as much as you thought. Well, I'm glad he's making friends.
Can I go with her? Mop it up. Women know how to have babies! Now! Back tomorrow!
The robber broke in several hours later. This... scent. Do you smell that? Honestly, I've been trying not to breathe. Well, if you did, you might detect the faintest trace of marijuana laced with embalming fluid.
We understand and completely respect your decision. Let's just get your little girl all stitched up, okay? This is a common complication of gastric bypass. The connections that your previous surgeon created widened, so your stomach pouch and intestines have stretched out. So, basically, it's as if I'd never had the surgery done at all.
N-no. Um, it's gene therapy. You know, Braden lacks the A.D.A. enzyme. Without it, he has no immunity. So in order to get it into him, I'm going to deliver it on a fast-replicating virus. The H.I.V. virus.
She's getting stabbed. Let it play. All that blood-- an artery was hit. She's dying. Uh, wh-what does the video's metadata say?
They were given to me by my mother to wear on my wedding day, and by her mother before. Only women of substance have worn these gems. They've been waiting, Katherine, for you. I'm so honored, Martha. Thank you.
You know what? The only problem now is trying to keep Brett focused on work. Free shot to any Puerto Rican with amazing abs! God bless you, Danny Burton. How come wherever gay guys go, attractive, single women seem to follow?
Look. He's in, all right? Now, that girl has a large chest, so I'm assuming that Burski will bring up motorboating in 3, 2... And they explode, all right? But girls are like pack animals.
I mean, the man's had a toothpick in his mouth our whole marriage, and I can't say a word. No, you can't sit on your feelings. You will explode! I have, like, 10 little explosions every day, so I don't have the big one. The women in my family...
I'm not sure, but she's been here so long I don't think I can ask. Met her over at shrugging pines. The old folks home over on elm? ! That's where you're picking up women? Boy, you're really going for the low-hanging fruits.
I was trying to get a gumball to fall out of my butt. But a kid is permanent. It's not like you're dating. You can't just stop calling or change your number or fake your own death because they annoy you. You do that to women?
Okay, I understand you're frustrated... No, what's frustrating is that every woman I meet runs screaming from me! I was married before and she left me and I tried to commit suicide. Don't write that down. Why are you writing that down? !
I think he's talking about Vincent. Sorry. They dropped me off blocks away for some stupid reason. You still have your morgue credentials? - Yeah, but, uh, we haven't found the gem yet.
And you'll be standing in the gallows with me. Which is why you can't fail. And I need John. The Bronze Age. A cairn on a grave was said to keep the dead from rising.
Please, let me. Oh, thank you. What's up with the music? I downloaded the collected works of Paige Dahl. Our investigation into her whereabouts is otherwise at a standstill.
I do, and I ain't goin'! Put him back inside. Come on. Remember when SpongeBob got that jellyfish as a pet, and he put it on a leash? Yeah. Squidward hated that jellyfish.
There were risks. He's psychotic, Alec. That's more than a risk. What happened was a glitch. He's better now.
Hey. Don't spoil your surprise. My surprise? Yeah. I wanted to get you something nice, and I figured a song might be better than flowers. Ah. Did you? Well, flowers are kind of expensive.
All right, pass me the kit. You know how to intubate a burn victim? I do. We just didn't have a ton of... Watch.
I still think that we should do The Importance of Being Earnest. Ever since you were a question on Jeopardy! , you have been such a know-it-all. Maggie, flowers came for you.
You mean, the ones that don't seem to make any sense. Yes, of course, I remember-- Shh. It's time. Well, you'll never guess what I found in the stockroom. Stock.
Looks like you had a productive night. Quite. A bracing reminder that I can function efficiently as a lone deductionist, should the circumstances dictate. "Computer virus stymied." British intelligence apparently concocted some malware and unleashed it on the Iranian government's servers.
Perhaps. At least, partially. I now believe the official theory accrued to the murder of Nadir Khadem is indeed a canard. Observe. If the attacker had struck him repeatedly with a bat... blood would have flown off the weapon as he drew it back for blow after blow.
That's right, Danny. Family. Uncle, cousin. Brother. See, what was tradition became ritual.
Relax. What's going on? The sample you gave me. I sent it over to the lab for processing, but... they say it never arrived. Very predictable.
I trust you know of a secure location for such a task. I don't think you're hearing me. [Eichhorst Speaking Spanish] You should have never brought her into this. You love her very much. Huh.


As I told you, to help. The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance. Privacy terrorists. This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier. Ironic.
I can help them if you fill me in, Root. Not now, John. I need you for something else. Root, I'm at The Carlton. What now?
Oh! Oh, God, help! Oh, help me. Ah, shoot, man. You all right?
I was going to leave this in your room... It wasn't his fault. Is that supposed to make it better? I'm so sorry. I know these things happen.

Don't let that little bit of gravity down there go to your heads. Start the clock. If all is going according to schedule, the astronauts should now be placing the moles on the comet surface. The moles are... Well, they're what they sound like.
What do we do? You have a choice. We have a choice right now. Ever since the comet was discovered, we've been hoping and working for the best, but we've also been planning for the worst. Our strategy has been twofold. First, our Strategic Missile Command is preparing to coordinate with the Russians a massive strike of Titan missiles to intercept the comets.
- Get her car here. Let's go. Would you come this way, please? Morton Entrekin, Ms. Lerner. I'm expected back at MSNBC at 6:00, and I think I should be there.
You should see my apartment. There's nothing there. It's practically Japanese. Seems kind of unfair that I got picked. You know, I'm not a doctor or a scientist.
Can we make it? - I wanna leave fast. - Okay. Let's pay this bill, get up very slowly... I think it's gonna be a long walk. Light, sir?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her? All right, look... you better put that goddamn blade away, man. Get your fuckin' head straight. I'm gonna go get the car washed.
You didn't say nothing about no door, yo. Chill out, man, all right. I smoke weed here all the time. This door's never locked. I didn't say the alarm would be off! All right.
Sorry, man. I'm sorry. All my life, I did everything right. I never screwed up. I fed the horse.
I have killed part of myself. I cannot change this. I... I must seek Buddha. I must seek Christ. You must seek therapy. That's what I would go with. But, that's my own... The MacGyver smoker is a very handy guy to have around.
-We should go after them. -I don't think so. I don't have her address or telephone number. If she wanted you to have it, she'd have given it to you. Sometimes girls forget to...
I was six. What's that? It's called a phone. An invention over a hundred years old. Why is it ringing?
Come here, little mouse, come to me! No I won't, little cat, you'd eat me. Yes you will, yes you will, you know it, too. Dog! Kill the cat! Kill the cat! I want to look, want to look at it.
No I won't, little cat, you'd eat me. Yes you will, yes you will, you know it, too. Dog! Kill the cat! Kill the cat! I want to look, want to look at it. I want to look as it squeals under your paws.
Though she stands in for Satai Kadroni, she has not yet undergone the ritual. It is inappropriate for her to speak. I have never yet known the truth or Delenn to speak only when it is appropriate. Go on, Delenn. Valen said the Shadows... would first return to their homeworld of Z'ha'dum before moving against us.
- Are they prepared to fire? - I don't know. I can't tell. Talk to me. Are they locked on us? Scanners are too powerful.
Once we know it's safe and they're serious, we'll send in the negotiators. Anyone else on my team? Just one. Commander Sheridan, Dr. Stephen Franklin. He's had a fair amount of physical contact with the Minbari before the war.
I've got a clear shot. I can take them. Mitchell, break off, break off. They fight bravely. They cannot harm our ships... but they continue to try.
I'm not certain about the "honored" part. I know what they say about me. You've been listening to rumors again. Rangers specialize in reports from distant places. Rumors are at the core of what we do.
I've failed. In a little while... the final slaughter will begin. I know the others do not want it. Even Morann is tired of war, tired of blood. But the war has taken on... a life of its own.
Negative, sir. - Communications. - Sir. Can we contact Earth, send a distress signal? It's possible.
- Communications. - Sir. Can we contact Earth, send a distress signal? It's possible. But, sir... that Minbari cruiser only left because it figured we were dead.
Anyone like jewelry? Look at that one there. Handmade in Italy, hand stolen in Stepney. It's as long as my arm. I wish it was as long as something else.
Get Nick... the greasy wop... Greek bastard round here now. If he's still stupid enough to be on this planet. Your stupidity might be your one saving grace. Uh? Don't "uh" me, Greek boy!
All right. There's this brass standing on the corner, right. Dwarf walks up to her carrying a suitcase. Winston, there, is gonna come along and see if he recognizes any of them. Now watch out for these fellows.
And people close to him? I have considered everything. Have you considered you not only risk our lives, you risk Phillippe's as well? And like us, he has a choice. What about it, Phillippe?
I have considered everything. Have you considered you not only risk our lives, you risk Phillippe's as well? And like us, he has a choice. What about it, Phillippe? All those years in prison, were they for nothing?
Listen to me! Listen, I beg you. You're right, it is rotten. I'll speak to the King myself. You have my word.
Well, you and Meredith need some time alone before the big day. - Mom, come on, that's not the plan. - You'll have more fun without me. Wait. lf you're not going, I don't have to go. I'm not a nature girl. But it's your chance to get to know the girls.
Can I ask you a question? Sure. How come I'm still in black and white? What? I've had 10 times as much sex... as the rest of these girls, and I still look like this.
Cool. Cool. "Cool"? What are you doing to these people? -lf I don't, who will?
-Well... -No, they do. Not just 'cause you're a good bowler. People respect you. Well, thank you.
What went wrong? Nothing went wrong. People change. People change? Yeah, people change.
My power cells continually recharge themselves. I can't imagine what it's like to be a machine. Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it is like to be a child. - Really? For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Did you ever, for one bloody second in your life, want anything more...than this? Your problem is you get what you want and do what you will. Worlds, Mandy, are built out of suffering. There is suffering at the birth of a child as at the birth of a star. You live in terror of not being misunderstood.
The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history. You bring shame to this house. You bring shame to your mother and me. It's a shameful, filthy thing you're doing... Do you hear me? Stand up!
- You all right? You know something? You've always been right. What have I been so right about? Women. You just have fun with them.
You know something? You've always been right. What have I been so right about? Women. You just have fun with them. You get emotionally involved, and they end up...
So you got me. Can I say something? I deal with a lot of people, but you two look truly happy. You're gonna make it. I know. Believe me. How do you know?
Something I couldn't show to anybody else without causing attention. But what those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them, it did very fast. - How was it contracted? - I don't know. But it could be a serious health threat.
And it reaches down into the lives of every man, woman and child on this planet. So, of course, no-one believes me. I'm an annoyance to my superiors, a joke to my peers. They call me Spooky. Spooky Mulder, whose sister was abducted by aliens, who chases after little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens to anyone who will listen... that the sky is falling.
SAC Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse that bomb. He just let it explode in his face, huh? What is no-one asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? It was too well guarded.
Forget the "Oh". I'll go to legal to start on the countersuit. The chips! That's the "Oh." These microprocessing chips.
The chips! That's the "Oh." These microprocessing chips. What do they do and where did you get them from? They microprocess.
There's a disclaimer. Legal says we're completely covered. You know what I'm sick of? Commercials showing trucks popping up on Mount Rushmore and parking on Abraham Lincoln's head. And shampoo commercials that say women can look like Claudia Schiffer after one cycle of rinse and repeat. What if these toys actually could talk?

Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is screwing up. Greetings. You've been drafted. Move! Is this entire household insane?
Ten hut! Gentlemen, senior advisor. At ease, men. All right, listen up, everyone. We are gonna hold the line here at Tan Canh... and mount a stage retreat back to where we are, Kontum.
Huang phi. It's a word that means "soft." Well, actually-- "Decadent." Do you understand? "They can never win because they use only those of our people... who are also huang phi.
What about all those things that we get? The casualty figures, battle reports, the briefings? The numbers are all phony. They make 'em up. These battles are a joke.
So who's in charge? That'd be Colonel Dinh. I don't know if Charlie works for him or he works for them. Don't matter much, though, 'cause nobody works for us. Maybe we should hand it all over the communists right now.
Then we discovered these tunnels. - Here, here and here. - Fire in the hole! - Watch the perimeter. - And over here, sir. - This is where we found the documents.
- Watch the perimeter. - And over here, sir. - This is where we found the documents. - What do they say? Last month we destroyed the Vietcong in this region. But according to these documents... another V.C. battalion has replaced them.
Please continue, Mr. Vann. I was saying the intelligence we now have indicates clearly... that divisions formerly positioned in this area... on the Cambodian border have been moved... to here, here, here and here... and now all share the Saigon theater of operations. General, there's aerial evidence of advanced movement to support this. And what is your conclusion? Well, sir, our conclusion is... the enemy is about to strike at the capital.
You keep it Now, let's get you out of here Wait a minute. Your men found me at the coffee shop I never told you where I was
28th of March, you and your group spent the night in this deserted exhibition hall On the 29th, your friends disappeared On 30 March, 3 very important scientists from my country were kidnapped and their whereabouts is still a mystery Where have you taken them? Now listen, my friend We witnessed five guys and the scientists at the power station
I don't know baby... I never even thought about having kids before. Seeing how my parents fucked me up and all. Yeah well, our parents didn't give a fucking shit about us. So fuck them! But we can do better.
- It is a lot of money, Bobbie. - We got money. We got half our money. Those ups we got left aren't worth shit now. How about the cops?
No, just resting. I brought you some chicken soup. You need something in your tummy. I'm not very hungry. You can eat it later.
Mike, buddy! You have to come outside with me. There's this chick out there... Two chicks. They're triplets, man.
William. Let's go. Your parents are here to take you home. Oh God. My parents!
I am alone. As a child, surrounded by the world, I felt safe. But on a cold afternoon, after school... something happened. I knew nothing about girls. Where do girls run to?
I'm Hopha, man. - What's going down? - Mike told me a lot about you. He told me a lot about you too, man. You know what I'm saying? So what the cops is telling you, man?
I'm thinking, I shot three motherfuckers and I don't know why. Oh, I, um, I don't know if all of you guys know, but, um, today's my last day here. I'm gonna miss you guys. - We gonna miss you too. Um, they, um, it's so wild that we had this conversation today, because, they have, they cut this program.
PH - don't tell me that that's "phone"? - Photo. And you did show us a photo of a house. There must be some connection. - I found the house. - On Sunset Boulevard?
Very fine, thank you. Boy, this place is scary! We would wheel you in on a gurney, just like this one, and if I had to store you overnight, we'd put you in here. It's refrigerated. - Is that thing always locked? - If a body is stored overnight, it is.
Let's go. You're gonna die tonight. Oh, really? I see. The call's coming from inside the house.
The worst I always wondered, I'd put that in this situation. I do not know what is inside me which led me to accept these things. I think long different, much worse. I have anyone to turn to find my bearings. It took many years to tell me I'm not a monster.
Do not leave... You say? I'm in Newark and I saw you. Come tomorrow. I gave my address.
If I don't let her go, she'll be in no mood for business. So I may as well let her go. So why did she tell me she can't do it? I wouldn't want to criticize her, but... as you know, Emerald is a mischievous girl. In this business, I buy in girls when they are seven or eight.
"Master Wang has abandoned me for Jasmin!" Master Wang simply called on Jasmin... for a cup of wine last night. And now he's here, as usual. Master Hong! Don't blame our mistress for being upset! When Master Wang began calling on her... she had many other callers.
And now he's here, as usual. Master Hong! Don't blame our mistress for being upset! When Master Wang began calling on her... she had many other callers. But they stopped coming... when Master Wang became her patron. We invited them back, but Master Wang said...

From a bag to another, you arrive to a bare plateau. Sélim started screaming... because I didn't know it and started walking. "There are hidden bombs there, bonehead! " - he tells me. "Get down! " I did.
What about the next flight? We would have to wait and see, sir How many are on the wait list? A lot, we have to wait and see, sir I think we are a little too late They say our country is small, but that one mountain alone is enormous
We want to search your house... Your information is wrong. We have enough proof. My son is an army officer's son! Some people were staying here.
The same courage and dedication. If you lose your job at the radio station, you can come and join us. It is night at the station... He was waiting for the train, but the rains came. Playing like a child. Piercing through the sky.
Brother! Hey there! Do you have a match? Never mind, if you don't have it. Glad to know you're alive.
Stop screaming like a girl. Hey! Don't call me a girl. You're right you're not a girl. Atleast better than those girls you run after. Excuse me!
Anjali... May I ask you something? Sure. Why is everyone staring at me? Why the boys are staring you know!
Anjali. The auspicious time is almost over please call the bride. Anjali let's go. I'll drag you to the marriage pandol I told you so didn't I? You know I always wanted to see that love in your eyes that I have in mine.
-That's right. And only very boring young men would take us to soirees... to talk about participles. Pio... how many daughters do you have? Five or six? Too many.
Pio... how many daughters do you have? Five or six? Too many. Are they pretty? Not as pretty as you two.
When would we get another bit of luck like this? A regular, sound income. And another thing. What'll happen when Don Rodrigo appears? I don't believe that the lion and the panther... will both be here by chance.
What's more... the wine was plentiful. And tell me. Where have the others got to? Well... Your lordship... those gentlemen have gone back to Jerusa.
She was a strange one. She'd sit out here the whole day long. Day in, day out... just staring at the sea. The fisherman all hated her. For us, the sea is unlucky.
The never-ending Flow oF life which has been Flowing since eternity it's the basis oF every religion to protect it, to respect it. Our world, our society Functions on the basis oF this very principle. Sonia Sehgal's passion was to laugh, to smile, to live. She was aged just 18 years, 6 months and 3 days when she was killed. On 19th February at 3 o'clock in the afternoon the criminal entered this girl's house and he beat her, raped her and murdered her brutally by crushing her head.
Despite knowing all this, why did you let him go away? Try to understand, my child. I will send Dubey to his village today itself. The Facts will be known From there itself. It's oF no use. He must have surely Fixed things there.
Shooting these travelogues on location gave photographer Jack Cardiff freedom to experiment with a Technicolor camera. Cardiff could observe and shoot with his painter's eye. People, if they're sitting on a lawn, they get green reflections from the grass. lt's a natural thing. But the average person wouldn't realize it. They wouldn't notice it.
That even at his age he would like to have stayed on and contributed more. Dr. Herbert Kalmus died on July 1 1, 1963 at the age of 8 1. Twelve years later, Technicolor management phased out the dye-transfer process he perfected and some say, has never been equaled. In 198 1, director Martin Scorsese said: "Most of the prints made during the 1950s on the Eastman Color process are already faded. "
- Da Hye. - What about her? Da Hye at the art museum. Excuse me. Excuse me, the alligators are not moving at all.
No sugar? No. Oh, black... Me too. I heard that this star called earth is a heaven to other stars.
We're not trying to build an army here. Well, maybe it's time we did. Three more German battalions have occupied the city and a panzer division is holding position 1 1 kilometers away. When the Americans arrive and the fighting begins, I don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing"Moonlight Becomes You." The Americans won't even be able to approach this city without our help.
Thanks. Set the charges here, here and there. This looks like a message from one of their reconnaissance teams. These must be instructions for troop deployments. The Germans must be taking up new positions outside the city.
In Paris, perhaps, but this is a small city, defenseless. We've learned to be a little more diplomatic. When this war is over, we want to remain on good terms with the victor. - Whoever that may be. - Whoever that may be.
The message! There's no time. Computer, exit holodeck. We'll take them to the medical bay. This neural interface has been damaged.
You don't know my"friend." He would never do anything to harm his own child. Encode a response to Allied Command. Confirm that we've received their message. Tell them we're proceeding according to plan.
Standing ovation. Now I know there's always a... Scuse me? Perfect start of the show. Thank you I know it's not easy for an audience to give standing ovation. There's always a few people that don't really wanna do it. I've seen those people. They're always like... "Are we doing' this now?"
picking'em, buying'em, does that go with that I don't think I can wear that, I'm missing a button, this is dirty, I gotta get something new, that's up my ass, can't wear this... I think we should all wear the same exact clothes. Because it seems to be what happens eventually, anyway.
Now, if they come out of hyperspace and see several Drazi or Brakiri warships waiting for them they'll open fire. They think they can handle it. They're probably right, they got solid armaments on their side. Exactly. But even the Centauri will hesitate with half a dozen White Stars waiting for them and that is where you come in. See, I've got the rangers keeping tabs on the Centauri.
Ta'Lon. Message waiting from Ambassador G'Kar. Do you wish to receive? Yes. Yes, of course. Greetings, Ta'Lon.
Very fine. I agree. So why are you troubled? I do not feel as if I am doing enough for the Alliance, Delenn. Be careful, G'Kar.
Think fast. I heard there's a secret rule that if a teacher's more than 10 minutes late, we can all leave. It's Giles' turn to watch study hall. He'll be here. He's allergic to late. He is wound a little tight.
- Cody Weinberg? - The one with the 35SL? - The very one. He's thinking of asking me to the pledge dance. - That's so huge! - Yeah!
Something terrible's happened. Just kidding. Thought I'd give you a scare. Are those finger sandwiches? I have an idea.
We talk to these people, we explain that I'm not a slayer and they let me go. Look out! Get down! That's gotta smart. I can let you out of that, or put a bullet in your head.
You've awakened the Prom Queen within. And that crown is going to be mine. Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive. It makes us accomplish.
Okay, here. Melinda Warren, blood of our blood Our great- great- great- great- great- great- grandmother We summon thee Blessed be.
Actually, I'm trying very hard not to say that. [ Chuckles ] - Oh, my God. - Um, no, no, no. Calm down. Please calm down. There is no need to be concerned.
- Magnesium? It relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchioles. Can you look at Mr. Frybush? Give me five minutes, okay? Carter, can you explain this evaluation?
Toothpick, please. And a length of tape. Keep that taped down, and come back daily to continue the extraction. I gotta catch a 6 a. m. flight to Cairo. Why can't you yank it out?
If the bullet hit his colon, you'd think he'd be hurting. The kid was masking his pain. How's yours doing? He's stable. No blood in the urine. Stool trace positive for heme.
Well, she was shopping the other day and a man came over to her and killed her and stole her pen! killed her? Well, they think so. They're keeping her in for tests. Well, you know what happened to Mr Sweeney?
Look! Here's me eating Tony! Tony's going, "No, get off me, I'm not dead yet!" I'd be going, "But I'm hungry, Tony." And Tony'd be, "Oh, no, go away," wouldn't you, Tony?
No, no, no, not really. I'm going to sit down now. Oh, God, no! I could never be one of those have-a-go heroes. I didn't know my own strength.
Look at you, you're shivering. Honey, is there anything we can do? You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther. Stop tormenting me! This is mink, okay?
Crematorium Chris? Sure. He said he would cremate my fur coat for free if I bring in the next person I know who dies. Oh, my God. Look at these pelts! Don't get too attached.
- Well, somebody did. Bud, stop acting like a spoiled little child. Don't talk to me like that. Sometimes the truth hurts. Oh, but it's all right just to say whatever pops into your mind?
I won't do it. Do you have children, sir? I'm going to assume that question was not an attempt to manipulate my feelings, commander. Because if it was, you're either desperate or stupid. And neither will play in this room.
Yes, sir. I'm Miss Latham's liaison. So whose side are you on? Well, sir, I don't take sides. Why did you send a Force Recon Team to El Bakkar, sir? Before the start of the ground war, the Navy pounded the shoreline with 16-inch guns.
Now, I can't say I mourn their deaths, but I did not order them killed and I don't know anybody who did. On the night of the raid, sir, Sergeant Morrison ordered the videotaping of the operation to be terminated outside Building 5. - Why? - You have to ask him. Well, I'd like to. It seems he's dropped off the face of the Earth.
Give the rest to your husband. I'm sure he's suffering from a hangover so I'll treat him to a prairie oyster. Once in a while, I'll do the preview by myself. I'm Jet Black, 36 years old. I'm often told that I don't look 36 but you shouldn't judge people by their looks or how much hair they have.
Legend has it that they become very heavy if moved against their will. Don't you dare touch her. I'm sorry if we upset you, Clare, but we need to understand. No, you don't. You want to prove I didn't see anything.
- What Frank sees is also different. He uses his ability, manipulates it to see evil, to feel it. I never know where evil lies, only that it exists. Don't leave him alone, Catherine. These visions are so isolating.
Who she is. I envy her strength as I fear my growing weakness. - Will Frank grow weaker? - What Frank sees is also different. He uses his ability, manipulates it to see evil, to feel it.
- I'm just going to have a look around. They want us to diagram the whole thing. - Anything in particular you're looking for? - No, just looking. The tail section travelled farthest.
-Why would we help somebody? -I know. That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for. The Samaritans were an ancient tribe. Very helpful to people. Excuse me. Could you tell me what kind of law this is?
We are, Your Honor. Mr. Hoyt. Ladies and gentlemen, last year our city council by a vote of 12-to-2, passed a Good Samaritan law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now, this group from New York not only ignored, but as we will prove they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint.
We got plenty of time too. This jury could be out for days. Hello. Damn. They're ready.
Okay. Here we go. [Inales Deeply] Look, Son. Daddy got in shape. [Exhales Deeply] [Groans] Oh. I've gotta keep trying. Or I could just move that picture.
- Dealing drugs? - Drugs? - I'll have to say drugs too. Close, but you're way off. Look at that beautiful garbage.
Don't breathe in. - Ow! - Sorry, Ned. I didn't see you down there! - Got him. - Uh, listen, Homer.
I hear they're running quite an operation over at the condos. I'd love to check it out sometime. So you're a real Schick supporter, huh? All the way to the White House. Hey, you got your party card? I wish.
It's out of control! Hey guys, I dodged the thing, and it missed me...ah! They killed Kenny! You...bastards! Oh my god. You tell me how much longer this thing is gonna last! let's see. A normal snake lasts 3 sec
Do it for the satisfaction of the look on Quark's face when he's beaten at a game of "tongo" by a lowly "hew-mon." Deal the cards. - We are approaching Soukara. - Stand by to bring us out of warp. There is an asteroid field directly ahead.
I can't say that makes me feel very sad. You can't be naive enough to think that the Dominion is going to stop with the Federation. When they're finished with us, they're coming after you. That's speculation. The Founders see it as their sacred duty to bring order to the galaxy- their order.
Be my guest. Ops. Hold. The less I'm seen parading through Ops, the better. I couldn't agree more. You seem angry. Who's watching Tolar?
Face it, Quark, it's good business. For thousands of years, Ferenginar has let a valuable resource go to waste. Females? A valuable resource? They make up 53.5% of the population and contribute virtually nothing to gross planetary income.
- l was worried too. - You're a good liar. Moogie, do you think it's a good idea to wear clothes in public? He's right. What if one of my Ferengi waiters sees you?
- lsn't that obvious? To give you what you desire above all else. The Alpha Quadrant. All I need is a certain Bajoran artifact, one of many the Cardassians appropriated during the occupation. How is this artifact going to help us?

The Prophets... They were here. They spoke to me. You had a vision, Emissary. We saw nothing.
- lt used to make you uncomfortable too. - Not any more. I guess the Prophets have spoken to me one too many times. I remember when you used to call them "wormhole aliens". Wormhole aliens or Prophets, it really doesn't matter.
You eat with such gusto. - Most of the time. - Not today. I wish we knew more about the reckoning. We'd have a better idea of what the Prophets want.
Please. - l'll see what I can do. - Thank you. Captain, I have a message from General Martok. Three Klingon cruisers are bolstering the defence of the Durala System.
- Don't worry. They rarely bite. - Rarely? We're directly below the temple of B'hala. These walls predate the ancient city by 10,000 years. Who built this place?
Coffee: the finest organic suspension ever devised. It's gotten me through the worst of the last three years. I beat the Borg with it. Oh, I'm sure Voyager will be fine. But I'm worried that the crew might be a different story.
When we get closer to the station, we can use the data processors in Astrometrics to download the message. Yes, Captain. Captain's Log, Stardate 51501. 4. After two days at high warp, we're close enough to the relay station to see it on long- range visual sensors. Not exactly what I expected. It looks ancient.
There's a latent datastream buried under the message. It's heavily encrypted. Encrypted? It appears to contain a large block of text and what may be maps. Can you retrieve any of it? Not immediately. When more of the letters have been cleared out, I should be able to access the coded message.
Thank you. will you take a look? Well I have some bad news. The samples show the entire area to be contaminated. It's in the water and the ground.
Where? Sounds good, no fluid in her lungs. She described it as more of a sharp stabbing pain. I have no idea what to say or do. her latest blood work shows a marked potassium efficiency
It is a Goa'uld attack vessel. It's a set up, it has to be. The goa'uld wiped out every last living person on that plant except Cassandra. And then they made us think that it was our fault... because they new we wouldn't leave her there... they new we would bring her back here. And they used there technology to put that thing inside of her.
Yeah, I guess it's my fault. I gave Eric a ride home. - So... - Get out of my chair! Okay. I really have to be going anyway. So your car is still at school?
Open the door, you son of a bitch! Open the door! Open it! - Open the door, you... - Fox! I'm going to go see if there's some other way in. Open it! Open the door!
They make nice cars. This is unbelievable. Mayday, mayday. This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. I'm on the SS Queen Anne. Ship in distress. Mayday, mayday.
We're making 21 knots at full power. If we got munitions aboard this ship, mate, they don't weigh but a few stone. But the Captain knew something. He wouldn't give up the wheel. The Nazis boarded us after they intercepted a radio communication...
I'll answer the question. That man is the scientist. Hey, Scully, you're not going to believe this. Get up here. What?
I was hoping to make enough money in Caesar's army to buy a fishing pole..., move to the sea. Well... That's all over now. So... Let me get this straight... You want Caesar and Pompey to fight. If their armies entrench themselves here, they'll be here for years. And your people will be enslaved Forced to feed an army of occupation. No.
-Xena... News. -How many legions does Caesar have? 15. That means his entire army's on the line. I've managed to recruit some miners.
And what about your troops, Xena? Right about now, the center of my line's pulling back like a retreat. And when your troops follow, like you told them... -... You'll trap them. -I'll destroy them.
Xena! I guess we are going on a voyage, after all, huh? What in Hades' name is going...? I'd like to know the answer to that myself. Who are these women?
I can't swim! What? I never learned. When I was little my brother and me were playing ball on the beach. I was real hot, and I wanted to quit... So I threw the ball, you know... Just so's he'd have to go and run for it.
Jake, ask her why she can't be upbeat once in a while. You see, Helen, if this was supposed to be macaroni and cheese, it would be very bad. But it's penne a la pesto, and judged by the standards of penne a la pesto, it's very good. Jake, what the hell are you talking about? Are you listening? Of course, sure.
So, hang in there, kids! Boy, you really don't get it at all, do you? Look, I didn't even want to write this stupid poem. I don't care about what other people do to themselves. But if you change that line, the poem becomes just another phony dishonest message.
He's toasted. I would like some toast if you are making some. Or food of any kind would be good. I am starving. I read somewhere... there are these people in India who fast, man.
Someone go make toast right now. We should record our conversation, man. Yeah, then we could play it back and write it down. I'll bet that's how the writers at National Lampoon do it. Yeah, I read somewhere that there are these people in France.
We should record our conversation, man. Yeah, then we could play it back and write it down. I'll bet that's how the writers at National Lampoon do it. Yeah, I read somewhere that there are these people in France. What do they do?
The Knights are users who are fighting to make the only truth there is into a reality. I don't understand. What do you mean, "one truth"? Like I said, I'm not a formal Knights member. They never explained it to me. But it's true.
You have issues with Catholicism, I take it? I have issues with anyone who treats God like a burden instead of a blessing... like some Catholics. You people don't celebrate your faith, you mourn it. - If we're wrong, what religion is right? - It's not about who's right or wrong.
I'll tell you where. They were offered up as a sacrifice to the god of ecumenical politics. You make it sound like there's some church conspiracy... to cover up "the truth about Christ." Oh, bullshit. Any important material about Christ... would give people a better understanding of the nature of God.
Do you still have that stone you wear about your neck? No. It's gone. Just as well. Why?
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue. You gave me your handkerchief which was also clean. That is the kind of hero I can be sometimes. You know why women used to get married, don't you? Why don't you tell me?
You gave me your handkerchief which was also clean. That is the kind of hero I can be sometimes. You know why women used to get married, don't you? Why don't you tell me? It was the only way they could lose their virginity and be free to do what they wanted with other men.
My wife. So did you get a look at these two guys? Hello. - Yeah. - What?
- I'll go with you. - It's fine. You're pretending to have a good time. I don't want to spoil that. I'll be right back. You think those whales piss in that water?
The meeting never even got started. The feds moved in... ... and bingo, the bosses, they moved out. My father and Dominic, they hid out in the field with some hay or corn. Along comes a farmer. Dominic bullshits him while my father holds out... ... this.44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacked the tractor.
We're just preparing to welcome the guests. They'll arrive here tomorrow. We're awaiting them. Good. Let's continue. At your take-off the USSR still existed and Gorbachov was in power.
I know it was... But I was poor and it happens a lot. That's not an excuse. I just... But to make matters worse, it now appears as though someone was filming me as well. So what was a stupid photo shoot now looks like a porn film.
No. Would you like something to eat? Something to nibble? Apricots soaked in honey? Quite why, no one knows, because it stops them tasting of apricots and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey you'd just buy honey instead of apricots.
This is only a bad dream. Where's the giant? This is only a bad dream. Yes, sir. This thing is real, sir.
There's a destroyer hunting us. They've spotted us. No, no, no. We're in a dense radiation belt. Gamma rays are clouding their screens.
From the sophistication of the equipment onboard... I'd say the vessel is a command and communications module. What's it commanding? At least six other ships down near the Brown Dwarf... are communicating with it. It seems to be transmitting jump coordinates.
Aye, aye, sir. This is Concordia rescue and recovery. Stand by for tractor. Welcome to Sol sector, Lieutenant. Your parents would have been proud.
I'm serious. When I was blind, I couldn't see. Don't laugh. I mean, people don't have expectations. They know what you are.
Hello, Pierce. Hello, sweetie. Virgil, I finished the sculpture. I didn't know where it was going to go. But that was OK. I really enjoyed letting it take on its own life.
Or a bowl of snot. You know what it reminds me of? Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat? No, but technically, neither did you. That's exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
Because you have to wonder how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like? Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal or tuna fish. That makes you wonder. Take chicken, for example.
We pull the plug. You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus? We don't have a choice. Never send a human to do a machine's job.
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. What is the Matrix? The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you.
Fine. Please, Neo, you have to trust me. - Why? - Because you have been down there. You know that road.
- And maybe they... - Shut up. It's a single-celled protein... Everything the body needs. It doesn't have everything the body needs. I understand you've run through the agent training program. You know, I wrote that program.
Look, this is important. These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year. - Why do you do it? - I don't know.
Come on! We should do this again sometime. - Where's your car? - What car? I don't know how Tyler found that house, but he said he'd been there for a year.
Maybe we should clean it first. Hey, yeah! And while we're at it, we can clean the whole house. This ain't our mess. Look, I can't go to the dance yet, okay? I'm sorry. My parents will be home in a few minutes.
It will kill as many people as possible and then drag a free soul into the Netherworld. That's some weighty shit there. Here's the kicker. I have the one thing that can stop this from happening. I just need to find the bastard whose hand is possessed. Weird.
You will think I'm crazy, but I enjoy the heat. -What did you say? -I said I really enjoy the heat. To most people it's unbearable. I remember going to school and wearing a white Ao Dai and near our school were rows of Phuong Vi trees with red flowers that blossom during the warm months.
Garret was too much like them. They thought, anyway, that he would be... ... ananchoraroundher , keep her life small. How did she die? Pregnancy just took the stuffing right out of her.
She gave me that. And if I tell you I love her as much as I loved you then you'll know the whole story. Rest in peace, my love. Garret. If some lives form a perfect circle others take shape in ways we cannot predict or always understand.
Billy Bob cried 'cause he's a bit of a cryer. And Tweeder drank beers 'cause... Well, Tweeder drinks beer. Lance is happy. He found his calling as a football coach. Wendell got his ride to Grambling.

- My cat's okay. I took your advice. They scanned my cat, I can play ! They scanned your cat... ? You got a CAT scan.
- My cat's okay. I took your advice. They scanned my cat, I can play ! They scanned your cat... ? You got a CAT scan.
- You have a lot of the signs. - Been watching me in the supermarket? Have women found you attractive? I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said the last time about me trying to lose weight and constantly not.
How did this happen? Every species of mammal has found some way to drug, inebriate or anaesthetise itself, even if it's just banging its head against a rock. Seems to be some natural urge to get away for a while. I've had it for as long as I can remember. When I got a scholarship to go to college, I was the first in my family to go beyond high school.
Shelly's family thinks the truth is very different. In Indiana, a sudden storm spells trouble for a motorcyclist. Tragedy seems inevitable until a mysterious lady in black appears from out of nowhere. Join me. Perhaps you may be able to help solve a mystery.
Well, it depends how selfish you feel. You wouldn't last a minute without us, Dad. Oh, he's awake. When I was a little boy, I was sitting on this wall waiting for me grandad, right.
Oh, he's awake. When I was a little boy, I was sitting on this wall waiting for me grandad, right. I was watching this car coming towards me, and it swerved, and as it swerved, it took off. The boot opened and the spare wheel fell out.
Thank you. Next year, be prepared, moron. What's with the cummerbund? I let him wear whatever he wants. Those boots are the best.
I know, but they were like brothers to us back in school. They're still like our brothers. Our very, very gay brothers. What are you doing after this? Going to a Klan meeting?
I know that place. Maybe I'll see you there then. Maybe. I gotta go. I bought tickets, and the show was the night before
- Of course. The pipeline the West is counting on to supply us for the next century. - Do you have an idea? - Maybe. How far is that rig from the terminal?
it can do that? Bust through a steel door? I ain't the expert. Given Gen 2's size and some room to move she could put a couple tons, maybe more, into a hit. So, yeah, in my opinion. if she wants through, she's coming.
She screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us. Please let me get out of here. What if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean? it's okay. The fence on the ocean side is titanium.
So, where do you work, Peter? Initech. And... Yeah? What do you do there? I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch. What's that?
Initech is an evil corporation, all right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to put on a bunch of pieces of flair? Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the register. Well, maybe you should.
Quit getting pissed at me. This was all your idea, asshole. All right. Okay. Let's try not to get pissed off at each other. Let's calm down, try to figure this thing out together.
What do you mean, "too"? Who else has fallen for me? I can think of a few, Variation No, 2, One who's so enthralled,he'd like it best lf you always bathed in his tub
Right now I see two of you, Miss Ilona Now the images are moving toward each other When there's only one image, you're in focus Good German craftsmanship Your beef roll is getting cold
, and especially of you, Can you remember what I said to you?" What did he say? That's personal "l'm very busy, My company is expanding with the German Reich Germany is becoming 'Greater Germany' for we are a people without enough room of our own"
- For me? - Goodbye - Goodbye lt's from Mr, Wieck He also sends regards to his dear friend Laszlo What eles does he have to say?
Do you have any idea what that means? You'll be prom queen? That is so not funny. Our best friend is dead. People won't be pleased.
And you're the kind of girl that tells. A tattletale. A rat. I know you. I know all about you.
We don't want people judging us by what we eat. It gives them ammo. The only ones with ammo are us. Food's cool. You need it to live. But the mere act of eating invokes thoughts of digestion flatulation, defecation even, shall we say, complexion defection. I'd never eat a greasy pizza.
-Fourth grade? -Yeah, we used to have sleepovers. Remember my Holly Hobbie oven? Your parents wouldn't let you have one. They were afraid of electrocution. We used to bake cakes together.
Because I couId put it in the closet, but I-- That is perfect dry cleaning placement. -You want a drink? -You want something--? Want some wine?
I'm what you call... a legal associate in the entertainment field, but don't let that throw you. There's no such thing as laws to enforce in the entertainment field. No, please, wait. Give me a second, please. Before you guys come to any conclusions, can I have your attention for a minute? Let me just take you through a little scenario, okay?
Maybe I'll call you... when I'm single. And three legs. Three. It was weird. And one of them was sick. But Miles didn't tell me anything about it. Blake. Blake talked to me. It seems he takes care of the other one, Francis.
Move. This is already affecting our schedule. Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel comes up that road. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. The compound has to be kept cold, or it'll ignite. Cold? Cold. How cold? Never let it reach 50 degrees.
His name is Tim Mason. - He's got the acrylic container. - Do we know what's inside? You don't need to know. Let's just get it back, all right?
Jakki. Samantha. All on their own journeys. Lost girls. I was the world to them.
Samantha. All on their own journeys. Lost girls. I was the world to them. In their time of need, they counted on me.
Let's have a taste and see how marvelous this is, no question. Delicieux. No surprise. Listen to me, Felicia. You'll not live in our house and keep company with a member of the British Army.
You're innately funny. I don't even come close. I'm nobody without you. Knowing that makes me rot inside. I never wanted to be funny.
Congratulations, you've succeeded admirably. Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough. Nice going, Dad. Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.
My parents are coming tonight. They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me. Gross. I hate it when my mom does that. They're such assholes.
That's OK. I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about 1 2. I'd go to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in.
I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about 1 2. I'd go to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking.
You said you're partners, so... what's your business? Well... He is a tax attorney. And he's an anaesthesiologist. How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face?
There's something cinematic about it. It's like a stage or something. You look all around, man. The graveyard is like a stage. Then all of these dead people too.
Yeah. - You look happier than hell, Jack. - Yeah, so do you. Well, I ought to be, man. What do you know that we don't?
But I can't. I don't know why, man. It's like I know where I wanna be and what I wanna do, so I don't know. I wanna come out of all of this stuff. He wants to be somewhere where he's not.
Hold that, please. It's the year of the independent film. Great performances, new faces-- I mean, really new faces. Who are you people?
I'd go over there all the time, and we'd buy a fifth of vodka and share it. And that really made me happy. Get ready again. Put your hand on the button. I'm serious, man.
Of which there are five. I don't know what that's about. You're a no-taxi city, aren't you? Five taxis, all going, "I got people in." Hours.
Sometimes that squirrel would be covered in make-up. "What? "Fuck off." He seemed to say. Squirrels always eat nuts with two hands.
"What? "Fuck off." He seemed to say. Squirrels always eat nuts with two hands. Occasionally they stop and go...
Come round your house, whizz through... Fffoooh! Fffoooh! They do nothing, they don't even eat flies. Spiders eat flies so they're all right, keep them. Flies don't eat fuck all so kill them. Clay pigeons get shot in the air.
"Oh, it's the same idea." No wonder they set up the Eastern bloc, for a buffer zone. So that's where they're coming from. About 20 million Nazi Germans died but they did start it. And, er... Yeah. So it was that.
About 20 million Nazi Germans died but they did start it. And, er... Yeah. So it was that. And Southern France collaborated with the Germans, embarrassing, so since then they've been kind of spiky and kind of French. I'm very positive on the French. My family way back was French.
People are going, "Remember kids, Jesus died for your sins." "Yeah, I know, it's great." "No, it's bad." "It's bad. lt's terrible. "Whatever you want. Just keep giving me these eggs."
Oh." "What is it, Lieutenant Sebastian?" "It's just the rebels, sir. They're here." "My God, man.
"What is it, Lieutenant Sebastian?" "It's just the rebels, sir. They're here." "My God, man. "Do they want tea?"
"It's just the rebels, sir. They're here." "My God, man. "Do they want tea?" "I think they're after something more than that, sir.
"Have you heard? On the stock market, rock's gone up three points. "No, it hasn't, has it? Cos it's fucking rock. "We wanted diamonds or sherbet or a squirrel with a gun."
"and I want to end it all right now. "PS I cannot shoot myself, as I have no opposable thumb." But it is, it's the... Pedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are the proof of this experiment. Pedigree dogs are all inbred, you take their grandmother and nephew...
"PS I cannot shoot myself, as I have no opposable thumb." But it is, it's the... Pedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are the proof of this experiment. Pedigree dogs are all inbred, you take their grandmother and nephew... And they're all next to each other in the genetic pool.
And, erm... I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. Oh, yes. You tear your history down, man. "It's 30 years old, let's smash it and put a car park here." I have seen it in stories. I saw a program on something in Miami.
It's just to give them affection, because I'm attached to them That's the only hope I have left If you could see those kids... they're in a sorry state So small, so vulnerable The mothers don't tend to them.
If you could see those kids... they're in a sorry state So small, so vulnerable The mothers don't tend to them. As if they want to be rid of them. They send their kids to school sick!
That is was copied from the Talmud. The Talmud, the Talmud, Rivka. Women don't study the Talmud. Father said the Talmud contains everything and its opposite. No woman dares say it but men don't want us to know.
It is our duty to work together to bring all the Jews and the lost sheep back into the fold. We must build and organize the Jewish force. Brethren, tonight at 8:00, we must organize and close our ranks under the Star of David. God Almighty, at the dawn of the year 2000 we will bring about deliverance. May the names and the memory of our enemies disappear.
What are you going to do? You pushed the cloth all the way in? You waited seven days? Yes. You checked the cloth?
You can't open up the phone book and say "gas," then "chamber," then "experts," and out come ten Fred Leuchters. No, there's nobody. Fred Leuchter was our only hope. We were married for less than a month when we went. Although she doesn't like to hear it, I normally tell her that was her honeymoon. That's not a particularly good place to go for a honeymoon, Poland.
There has to be something to remove the gas after it's been put into the room. There has to be some kind of device to heat the chalk pellets... and sublimate the gas to get it to go into the air. These things didn't exist. Auschwitz is very, very different... from the place it was during the war. Everything has changed three or four times... since that camp operated as an extermination camp.
The second week that the ad was running, someone saw the ad. Determined that the instrument shouldn't be sold... because I was the one that was selling it. Subsequently, there was write-ups... in both major Boston newspapers... and pressure was again applied to the district attorney's office... and the attorney general's office... to prosecute me for selling the machine. And it was necessary for the attorney general's office... to explain in the newspaper that it is not illegal... to sell a lethal injection machine to anybody. Delaware turned out to be a major problem, but I still have their machine.
I prepared years to go there. And to have a fool come in, coming completely unprepared, it's sacrilege. Somebody who walks into the holy of holies and doesn't give a damn. I expected to see facilities that could have been used as gas chambers. I expected to see areas that were explosion-proof. I expected to see areas that were leak-proof. There have to be holes in walls or areas where they had exhaust fans and pipes. There has to be something to remove the gas after it's been put into the room.
The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They werebluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there.
I rememberverywell. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can.
Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? I rememberverywell. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain!
Like with math, my reasoning was fine, but I couldn't learn multiplication tables. That's a problem. Nice place. Surprises you, eh? It's small, but it has everything.
It's like a stage where l can rehearse. I'm a high class bum who's not handsome, yet I've had over 10,000 women. Why me? Because you have to talk to them. Nobody bothers to talk to women anymore.
I'm a bit of an ice-maiden. I see why the Chinese used an ivory replica to probe your body. Though even that's distasteful. Porn movies, too, protect your libido, you watch a surrogate image. But what you can't tolerate, you can't tolerate in images, either.
My sword is guided by the teachings of Hiten-Mitsurugi. Yet, many times, I cannot use it to save even one person's life. Not one living soul. It is enough that I bury the corpses, I suppose. I notice you've made graves for the bandits as well as your family. They were slave traders, not my family. I was sold to them after my parents died of cholera.
Yes. You also told me that I could never be happy living an assassin's life. Yes, I did. You were right. However, I can't stop killing, yet. The new world will come soon.
No, we become Batman when it's time to hide some porno. That's right, you hit the light switch, the whole bookshelf shifts to the side. You go down two flights of stairs into your porno cellar. Janet Jackme, Kobe Tai, Jenna Jameson, that's right. But women always find the porno.
"You don't talk. "You need to talk, let's talk. You don't talk." That's right. Women love to talk. If they had talking in the Olympics, a man wouldn't stand a chance.
"What the fuck was on my mind?" It's like the movie Scrooge, and the Ghost of Pussy Past comes. "Remember me? I'm itchy, the stripper from Miami." You know what else happens after you take an aids test?
No I such. Excellent. Rather a spectacular returned to form after the genius moment Baldrick. Still ... I think someone with common sense ought to be able to resolve this.
The one which breaks the seal. The other path you circle Shikoku once for each year of the dead persons age. The dead of Shikoku ascend Mt Ishitsuchi and are purified there. But one too strongly attached to this world may not ascent Mt Ishitsuchi. It is these souls who grows restless.
When you're here there's ghosts everywhere! This way. Mr Oda. What is this place? Well, I've never been here before. Wouldn't the villagers know more?
Although more than five million American and Mexican citizens, passed through this dragnet, practically no marijuana was intercepted. After three weeks, Operation Intercept was abandoned. I have a couple of burritos, Over. Have you brought the hot sauce? Over.
- So I had to farm with a little baggy for three days before I got it back. - That's some heavy shit man... - Hey man, I'm I driving okay? - I think we're parked man. HOLLYWEED Everybody get high, Sing bustin' out!
They give him 10 for 2! What else can judge Columba do? We got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, set him... free! FREE! Consistent with the changing times, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, passed an ordinance taking marijuana possession out of the criminal code.
Thanks a lot. Dad, isn't it true that this area is going to be torn down? That's what they say. They've been talking about it for so long... I don't know what to believe. They're going to build high-rise buildings here?
No. It's cheap, but in today's world speed counts for everything. So, I turn you down. Give the phone back. I told you.
Will she be so lucky like you and get released? Should we go save her? She is in danger! What can you tell us? I borrowed money from them but I can´t pay up
Should we go save her? She is in danger! What can you tell us? I borrowed money from them but I can´t pay up So they kidnapped me

Yee! What is it? Did you get something? They came back safe from the hands of the kidnappers I think Ma must be doing something with the criminals
I think Ma must be doing something with the criminals And I think they must have started the operation Why are you so sure? Miss Fu was released after being kidnapped for two days Why not after three days or four days?
Please contact me after you are back Thank you Hello Miss Fu, I am Officer Kwan You just come back? Yes! The factory your boyfriend used to work is closed down We can´t find its address
By law they can take it. -They can't take it by law. Everyone here cut down the trees in their fields. They told me to do the same. Then the forester would have just gone away. They cut down all the trees. And the governor came and gave them their title deeds.
Let me show you one then. Then we'll drink something. Ali look, a tortoise. Come on. It's escaping. Hurry. Not bad!
It will be the same with your powers unless you control them. I can help you do that. How? I'll show you a way to focus your powers that will make you invincible. Show me!
-Yes. Good. A bit bitter, isn't it? It's the poison I made just for you. You'll die if you stop loving me.
Are gloomy without her She is like a swallow Whose wings Have been clipped Caged birds
Whose wings Have been clipped Caged birds Can they still fly? Violated children
When I gave you water to drink I fell down on my knees That's the day that we became Friends for life, until death There's something that binds You to me, something very strong Caged birds
Friends for life, until death There's something that binds You to me, something very strong Caged birds Can they still fly? Violated children
There was some trouble with the x-ray machine in Germany. What kind of trouble did you have? - I told you of its power. - Yes, of course. My credentials were the only thing that prevented me from being further detained. I can't explain how it is, but the two pieces have become one.
Who tends the flames? Can he reignite the spark even as it grows cold and weak? - The ceremony's begun, if you want to go in. - No. I don't think that's right. I don't share in their faith.
Matter and gas. Will this all end one day? Life no Ionger passing to life? The Earth left barren like the stars above? Like the cosmos?
The confidence, the optimism. I let his spirit fill me. Try it. It feels silly. It is silly, but once I let myself feel the change, it emanates from me.
Time to go home. You coming? No, I've actually got some work. I'll see you later. Men are out there. The good ones don't go to bars.
I let him pass through me. The confidence, the optimism. I let his spirit fill me. Try it. It feels silly.
Do you remember that word? Do any of you remember what it was like to have one? Because from what I'm hearing ... Um, can I stop you? Where does it say women aren't sexual objects? I mean, of course they are. And here's a flash: They like it.
I mean, ARE YOU NUTS? What's with all this "Let's all be the same"? We're not the same! That's why God made different sexes, so we'd be DIFFERENT! And it's natural for men to enjoy those differences. You're not going to, uh, change that with meetings. Ultimately, a man will be ruled by his wants, just like women will be ruled by theirs.
The panther was wounded... And I was careless. Ouch. My back was broken in 5 places. They had to replace my spine. The operation was excruciating...
- Oh, God. - Where'd it go? Get the door open. No. You can't let that thing out of here.
- If you don't know how I feel about... - I don't. This isn't a relationship. You don't need me. All you care about is lots of orgasms. OK. Remember how we talked about private conversations?
- No. It's nice that you're excited. It's just in high school, knowledge was pretty much frowned upon. You really had to work to learn anything. But here, the energy, the collective intelligence, it's like this force, this penetrating force, and I can just feel my mind opening up. And letting this place just thrust into and spurt knowledge into...
- Oh, wait, no. He's a good man. Have we met before? You look familiar. So have you known the sisters long?
- Alan Stanton. Nice to meet you. - So you know Prue, huh? - Yeah, we go way back. Yeah, well, Prue and I actually dated a few times.
I bought us some time in the hopes that Grams could help us. Oh, she's going to be so thrilled when she sees you. The Charmed Ones. - Where was I born? - Mom.
Right. I can't stop thinking about Mom. How I lost her and then I found her again. I'm just glad that you finally have memories of her. What?
How many fingers? I think I'm gonna hurl. This guy's not exactly what you'd call a ladies' man. But I tell him, it is easy. There's only one rule, plain and simple:
We have a mass casualty incident. Implement disaster protocol. Set up Curtains 1 and 2, Trauma 2 and 3 for critical patients. John, will you put IV stands and gurneys in the hallway? I need warm saline, rapid infusers, and O-negative available at every bedside.
And the winner for best performance as a husband goes to... Ray Barone for "Mr. Fantastic visits a Park." Yay! I have nothing prepared. Oh, you found the paper. £­ Yeah, I was able to find it. £­ Hmm.
It's a Steel City Beer bottle cap. Man, I haven't seen one of these since high school. Frank, what are you doing throwing bottle caps in there? It wasn't me. I never drink that stuff.
- Right. Right, Dad. We've been having some good conversations lately, haven't we? - We sure have. - Yeah. They've been enriching.
Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother Jimmy. That's why Mom and Dad adopted you. Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport? Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents?
Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari. You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every continent.

We can't find them, Pilot. False information yet again. The DRDs still show Officer Sun on Tier 2. Rygel outside the Centre Chamber... - D'Argo in... - Competent!
The DRDs still show Officer Sun on Tier 2. Rygel outside the Centre Chamber... - D'Argo in... - Competent! You got it wrong, Four Arms, they're nowhere.
How's she doing? Same as us...scared. Well, we'll do what we can. She knows. You'll be happy to know we have a plan.
We could do that telephone thing... ... whereyouhaveacan, we have a can... ... andit'sconnectedbya string. Or we could do the actual telephone thing. The One Where Everyone Finds Out Oh, my God. I Iove this apartment!

God forbid. Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. -That's why they jazzed it up. -Boring? Baseball wasn't--
Get erased here, it's over. These people got no notion of an afterlife. It's not even a concept. What about the real world? Don't they believe in that? What good would it do 'em?
- What on God's Earth is this all about? My fiancé, Tom Hobbes. We buried his body. All you buried was a box. - We'll have to transport it. - No.
- Sustained. Nothing further. Then we are in recess for lunch. All parties report back here at 1330. When do I testify?
Well, the only explanation is that their numbers are wrong, either through intentional fraud or negligent controls. Oh, I see, professor. Because you refuse to believe in an event that defies our current scientific understanding, that event must not have happened. You're asking me to prove a negative. That psychic phenomena doesn't exist.
I'm not very good around women. See, I'm awkward. My pits sweat. I chew my lower lip. The women Frank introduced me to were not beautiful...
- It's what they didn't find that made 'em send me to New York. Irregular investments in oil fields, which might or might not have been outside the charter. - Which is it? - Aggressive but not illegal. I checked into the assets. They were right on the line.
He liked the thrill of controlling women who struggled against him, the sick bastard. He said that he and his homeboy, Tucker, used to tie farm girls to trees and then sit in the woods just laughing, getting off on watching them struggle. - Martin was from Tennessee too. - Yeah.
It crashed. But better the machine than the market. Computers will always break down, but the most important equipment - is the nut behind the keyboard. - Mr Martin, I started this company in my garage on this same computer.
We'll have no trouble here. Tubbs have nightmare about new road. How many more times, Tubbs? This is a local shop. Mm? For local people.
- Friends. - Pens. - No, friends. - Pens. Best friends you can have. Everything I know about people I've learned from pens.
- Pens. - No, friends. - Pens. Best friends you can have. Everything I know about people I've learned from pens. If they don't work, you shake them.
What about the road to Royston Vasey we're finally getting. Hallelujah! Let's just hope we don't get a visit from Pog or Loopy, those soap dodging road protestors driving round in their converted ice-cream vans, pierced belly buttons, pierced eyebrows, pierced tongues. They'd have their arse-holes pierced if they got the cheeks into the machine. If I had my way, I'd shepherd them all into one of their tunnels, knock out the pit props and see how they like being close to the earth then.
The hands were an unexpected discovery. And while the origin of the vessel is Japanese, the hands are Caucasoid. They're roughly two years old, in size, and all apparently male. Agent Hollis. The captain and crew confessed to the handbags.
The path of destruction from the sins you have accumulated, Now is the time to recognise these as manifestations of your own fierce pride, Now is the time to turn away, Oh, son of noble family. Now you will see the dawning luminosity.
Because not everything evolves, Some things just happen, Like the eye, Even Darwin worried about the eye, The iris, lens, retina, How could any of those things evolve in isolation?
How could any of those things evolve in isolation? How could they be useful on their own? So how did the eye happen? How? Accident, It just happened, We don't know how, we don't know, One minute we're blind, next minute we see,
29-28, Cramer. And Judge 3 has it, 30-29. The winner by split decision: Hamid Khan. You see that?
There's only one thing that's gonna make this all okay. You dead. Lockdown! Come on. Move it. People are defined by three things:
Did you do it 'cause of Hernandez? You earned your cojones by blinding me? It started out that way, yeah. But, you know, this place... I hate this fucking place.
Talk to me. This'll get you in deep shit with Schillinger, man. Fuck Schillinger. All right. I got a package coming in on Thursday.
Beth's up here in the freezer doin' her doctoral thesis in psych. Uh, I have a, uh... friend of mine who's a psychiatrist. You'll need one after you've been up here for a while. - What's she studying? - Us.
Some army stuffi -manuals, books, equipment. A - A worn-out Rambo video. But there's just so much stuff... I haven't had time to go through it all yet. We need to alert Miss Parker and Lyle... as this may be relevant to their investigation. That's the other weird part.
Captain Saunders here is the leader of Rion's training unit. He was there the night he died. -We'll be doing some talking, Captain. Most definitely. -Your file tells me damn near everything except your rank. I don't even know if you're supposed to call me "sir."
So what are you gonna do about it? I'm going to give Captain Saunders... a little taste of his own medicine. It's okay to drink now. Trust me. "Tick tock." Jarod wanted you to find that watch.
- I got the C.D., Kyle, thanks. - Did you? That's great. Your dad let me in. Kyle, I know when two people break up, it's... it's not easy.
Your dad let me in. Kyle, I know when two people break up, it's... it's not easy. You know, it's not as easy as they thought it would be, you know? - Sorry, man. - Yeah.
The more we have, the faster we heal. Now everyone take your place in the circle. There's a line for each of you leading to the center. Nasedo gave me these stones. They're from his place.
Charlotte will be picking up men at the next grave site over. Breathe, sweetie, breathe. I'm all alone, Carrie. The first people on my "call in case of emergency" list are my parents. And I don't like them.
You brought Iilies. You said they were her favorite. please tell me those are your sisters. I don't have any sisters. Charlotte realized she wasn't the only woman resuscitating Ned.
Listen, boy. I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention. No need, Dad. Over the years, I've learned to find father figures wherever I can. Construction workers, the Internet and Nelson here.
Mr. K knows I'm here, he'll go after my friends. I've got to help them. No. You're not going anywhere. You've lost too much blood. He'll kill them. Well, you can't be much help to them if you're dead.
What happened? Beats me. Did you say something to her? I know how to talk to people. These blacks.
Can you admit to yourself that yes, you're sad but you're angry and full of rage? I'm sad. It's hard to admit that you may have feelings of hatred towards your mother, isn't it? You're out of your tree. Listen carefully. Of course you love her. What I'm trying to say is, own the anger instead of displacing it.
Divorce is for those who never intended on dying married in the first place. You know, Carm, we reap what we sow. What do you mean? You admit to accepting his dalliances in the past. Schifosas. They meant nothing.
- You know why? - I don't know that I give a fuck. Everybody loved him because he never ate alone. It was the longest time of peace in Rome's history. He was a fair leader and all his people loved him for that.
Alright, boys! We're going to show you a couple of commercials and you tell us which toy interests you the most! Now, watch carefully! Hey, kids! Do you like Chinpokomon? ! ell, then you're gonna go wild for Wild Wacky Action Bike! "Wild Wacky Action Bike! The bike that's hard to ride!"
What the hell's goin on? Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found some big animal creature! It ran over that way! Hold on! I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, c'mon!
! We gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do! You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now Property of the United States Government! Call those boys' mothers!
How do you like that, huh? If you ever want to see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! There his is! Back away from the spacecraft, children! No! No, it's okay! The ship took us to another planet! A beautiful lush place called Marklar! And the leader, he says that all the Ethiopians can go live there!
- Doesn't that get confusing? - Yes? - You see? ! I think I can explain this whole thing! Marklar, these Marklars want to change your Marklar! They don't want this Marklar or any of these Marklars to live here, because it's bad for their Marklar! They use Marklar to try and force Marklars to believe their Marklar!
What the hell's goin on? Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found some big animal creature! It ran over that way! Hold on! I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, c'mon!
She cannot share it with you. - I want to spend my life with her. - If you do, you will know only sorrow. And now, the continuation... Did they say why you can't marry Kasidy?
You're doing the right thing. Founder. - When do we reach the rendezvous? - Approximately 36 hours. May I say your plan is brilliant?
When I found out our people were the leaders of the Dominion, I realised I had no place with them. This war they're fighting is wrong. I can understand their distrust of humanoids, but why conquer them? Better to avoid them altogether. You don't much care for humanoids.
I was able to fire a bullet into that melon while standing outside. - Through the wall? - I don't see any bullet holes. I attached a micro-transporter to this TR-116. The bullet was beamed into the room, a few centimetres from the melon.
The good Ranjen doesn't much care for me, does he? You'd think he'd be pleased to see his Kai so happy. Are you happy, Adami? More than I've ever been in my life. The Prophets are smiling on us.
- Get away! Enough! The Prophets have done nothing for you. During the occupation, they turned their backs and let our people suffer. Let me go!
During the occupation, they turned their backs and let our people suffer. Let me go! You've sacrificed everything for them, and how have they rewarded you? They've appointed an alien Emissary. They've rejected you at every turn.
The sacrifice made by the Eleventh Order will not be in vain. They forced the Klingons to commit valuable troops and resources to capture a strategically worthless planet. - I'm glad you agree. - I don't! You condemned loyal Cardassians...
He claims you called for him. - Show him in. - As you wish. I remember when I first saw the gate of the Celestial Temple. I was on the Promenade. When it burst into view, this whirlpool of colour and light, the people around me were in awe.
Eminence, Anjohl is here. He claims you called for him. - Show him in. - As you wish. I remember when I first saw the gate of the Celestial Temple.
- It doesn't say what they are. - Don't worry about that. It's all itemised in a secret protocol between the Dominion and the Breen. All you have to do is sign the document as the acknowledged leader of the Cardassian Union. - I want to see this protocol.
I do not love you as I loved Jadzia. There's no crime in that. I dishonoured myself. I know how often I use that word. Maybe too often.
The Unas host was dying. It had nowhere else to go. It went into him. Forgive me. By the sorrows ye suffered in your agony in the garden,... ..in the scourging and crowning with thorns,... - The prayer for suffering souls. - ..in your crucifixion and death,... ..have mercy on the souls.
The fate of your friends will be pleasant compared to what I have planned for you. Return them to the pit. Kintac. You will be my first prime. It is my honour.
Tell me how to penetrate the Earth's Stargate. Tell me now... or I will kill your father. Teal'c, this is your god, Apophis. Risen from the fires ofNetu. The fate ofyour friends will be pleasant compared to what I have planned for you.
Bow to Apophis, the deliverer! Yes. Sokar will come. I say let him come! My lord, a cargo ship was spotted in orbit around Netu.
Speaking of which-- Everybody dance now! (theme music playing) Okay, so I'm at the ATM trying to get 20 bucks to get us some coffee, and it spits out this piece of paper that says, "Funds not available." So I'm like, "I don't think so." And the guy who lives under the envelope table starts giggling at me.
Shoes? How could I miss that? Is it my imagination, or do you get handsomer and handsomer? No, it's true. I get handsomer by the minute. I've got time-lapse photos that would amaze you. Grace, Grace, how do you like my new suit? Look, look, look, no panty line, because... no panties.
Be that as it may, we now have an unquarantined animal loose. Loose? This animal's more than loose. It seems to have killed two people. Oh, no. Let me assure you, this is not a predatory animal.
Very cute. They're a nice couple. What do you think, Gene? Ladies, my compliments to the chef. Cami, Sissy?
No, no. He deserves what he gets. Mulder, it was here. Mulder! Several residents have come forward to blame neighborhood deaths on homeowner-association president Gene Gogolak.
He's a rabble-rouser. He's trouble with a capital T. And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch. Here we go. Yeah. I'm guessing there's one of these in every yard.
Um... The, uh... The 35 pounds of ground chuck... that Mr. Rice told you to throw away... what did you do with that? - I threw it out. - Where? In the Dumpster... behind the restaurant. Hmm. That's weird.
Absent another theory, how do we account for the extraction of this man's heart? I don't know. I have no idea. We have no evidence, no MO to speak of. This could be the perfect crime. A crime is only as perfect as the man or the mind that commits it.
Mulder, I have to tell him something. What do you want me to say? Tell him I'm down here doing a background check on somebody. I got a message you needed to see me, Laura. What is it? I'm afraid.
What I wanted you to understand... Is that I'm in love with you. That I've loved you since high school. I'll build the ark, you gather the animals. I was kidding.
I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back... I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. I assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
Whoopsie-daisy. You are accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead? - Absolutely 99 percent not guilty. - The prosecutor will call a witness.
Excuse me, I have to go. The army is retreating! Our heroes crap themselves in front of the artists. They prefer to kill blacks. Stop, or you'll regret it.
This will end badly. But you're stubborn. You're an ignoramus. Revolutionaries always end up giving payback to superior interests. Multinationals, and so on... I don't care about multinationals. All that interests me is the people
No noise, or there'll be shooting! Do you think we'll give the people justice and happiness? That's for dreamers like you. It doesn't exit. Those new politicians are crawling to the people. "What a brave people, so humiliated and oppressed"
Whatever Eloise was or wasn't didn't matter to me. She was the love of my life, even though I hadn't actually met her yet. OK, Dan, wait, wait, wait... and surprise! OK, this is one of the nicest spots at the Million Dollar Hotel. We call it "The Lobby".
- How's that? - Suicide is the lowest crime to a Jew. We don't have suicide. We never needed it. Hardly ever.
Good luck, sir. Like never trust politicians or parking meters. Like on the first day, you know, me and Izzy, when we got along. Seeing our plan actually working was amazing. I was just worried my friends would be even more disappointed if it all fell apart.
Let me call my people again. Why don't we all quietly accept that we're fucked? I mean, Geronimo owns the paintings. They got him in jail for killing Izzy. - There's no way. - There's always a way.
Yeah, even among the freaks. I could play the violin and wipe my own ass at the same time. And I saw more cruelty and more desperation than in a hundred war movies. But mostly, mostly what I saw - delusion. These people wanted to believe things that weren't true.
- This is a family business. - A dysfunctional family business. A family from nowhere! Hey, remember I told you how people came to the lobby to talk about the good old days and watch television? Suddenly it was like the good old days were back and television came to life.
Yeah, much better. The last one tasted like bat's piss. You can just pour it. You can just pour it. - How are you doing on that appetizer? I'm eating it.
That's exactly what I told you with the purple and everything, you know. Wow! What a night! What a sight! You know the way they always tell you the bad stuff about murder? I have to say, Izzy's life might've been shitty, but his death was pretty great.
- Well, I'm from the limo company. - Oh, limo. Send them to the back, so the guests can get in, and drive around the block and arrive in front. Wow, it was gonna be a big night for us and for the hotel. She finally looked like a million bucks.
Thank you so much. This is Fielding. Hi. You're a blessing. I'm saying that if you want real social change revolutions have a terrible track record.
Calling only your elections politics is part of your sickness here. I am so sick of having to apologize for being an American. - North American. - Oh, God, I'm so sorry. North American.
This country is the best we've been able to do in the history of the planet. You can't be serious. We know our government plays rough. Of course it does. All governments do. But when you compare it to a country like Chile where even the leaders of the opposition come from the upper class a guy like me would have no shot.
It seems wrong to think we belong together. But I think it. I do too, but I think I know why. Why? Because it's what we want.
Their entire scheme seemed to be on the verge of collapse, until they hit upon an incredibly ingenious plan... What? ! Dawn broke at 6:00 am. The day of Fearless Leader's deadly broadcast had finally arrived. And there was Karen, toiling away under the watchful eyes of a tall, blond, incredibly handsome, Swedish-American prison guard named Ole.
Martin and I would like to wish you guys luck against Fearless Leader. Yeah, and we would come help you guys, but, we don't wanna get hurt. Yeah, man, we're not going near him. Yeah, until we met you guys, we almost totally lost faith in America. You know, and we lost faith in our car.
OK? I'm different now. I'm still made of all the same things. Calcium, iron, zinc. All the elements.
My analysis ofcards played shows a 77% chance ofyou losing, Benjamin. Five miles of fibre optics sort of spoils the spirit of competition, don't you think, Sweetie? Gin. When I reprogrammed her for this tour, I put some human traits into her personality profile. I sort of wanted them to find out because it'd really piss them off.
I was scavenging, OK? Strip mining. It's amazing what the government leaves behind when they abandon a place. I was with a group of people I thought were my friends. We didn't find much.
No problem. If I go down, I'll need a full layout. I wanna know what the hell I'm walking into. You think there are more survivors? I don't know.
Our universe is expanding, but the matter in it is finite. This thing fixes that. It creates new matter to keep the universe young. - A creation device. - Until you get it home.
"Find a husband. " Ma, this Tupperware is broken. Ma, the cops will take that cake apart right in front of you. To see if you're bringing in drugs. They'll break it all up, crumb by crumb.
Time to abandon ship, guys. This flea's been bugging me for a week now. This isn't a flea... it's an elephant. Gotcha. The floor is all tiled.
What's the matter, Clesius, cat got your tongue ? Step on a nerve, Clesius ? I get you. Got you, got you. These potatoes sure are scrumptious, aren't they ? - Ain't that a kick in the head.
Tell the whole world ! Her husband ain't nothing but a big ol' pile of worth less crap ! I'm just glad they're back in town so you can fil nally meet them. I'm extremely nervous because I really want to make a good impression. Sherman, there's no reason foryou to be nervous.
Her husband ain't nothing but a big ol' pile of worth less crap ! I'm just glad they're back in town so you can fil nally meet them. I'm extremely nervous because I really want to make a good impression. Sherman, there's no reason foryou to be nervous. My parents are very down-to-earth people, and they're gonna love you.

My parents are very down-to-earth people, and they're gonna love you. I guess it's not like they're rocket scientists.
We do have the evidence We do have it, and it is clear and incontrovertible And let me say something else Those weapons must be taken out of Cuba You, the Soviet Union have created this new danger not the United States
Jesus, Mary and Joseph... Take off for two hours you're gonna miss a little drama I told you how stupid it was to float that Lippman article Now you're gonna do it for real? The Jupiters are obsolete, Kenny They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer
Take off for two hours you're gonna miss a little drama I told you how stupid it was to float that Lippman article Now you're gonna do it for real? The Jupiters are obsolete, Kenny They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer I know they're obsolete That's not the point!
Do you want to talk about it? That kind of thing? No. Thank you, though, Dick. Look at these. I used to dream I'd be surrounded... by exotic  <hon>women<hoff>'s underwear forever and ever.
Might not have moved at all. The light plays funny tricks this time of day. "A ball is seemed to have moved if it leaves its original position in the least degree, but not if it merely oscillates and comes to rest in its original position." Is she different? Sometimes a ball will shudder... and then settle back again, Junuh.
By Ostrovsky. I was the bride. At the time David was out of sorts - he drank too much. He was working on A Dream Play. He'd left home, was living alone.
Yet I think we were relieved. The court proceedings began. Markus, of course, ignored our horrible agreement. Then the verdict came. I was given sole custody.
H e made Jamie the bagman. Dressed him up with a pocket full of smack. It's hard to believe, isn't it? That our noble guards would do such a thing. Just telling you what I heard.
- Shall we? The defendants may now make their final statements. Defendant Hermann Goring. This has been a poor excuse for a trial. But firstly, I must reiterate my lack of knowledge for these terrible mass murders, which I cannot begin to understand and furthermore, I condemn wholeheartedly.
The defendants may now make their final statements. Defendant Hermann Goring. This has been a poor excuse for a trial. But firstly, I must reiterate my lack of knowledge for these terrible mass murders, which I cannot begin to understand and furthermore, I condemn wholeheartedly. As to the trial, the statements of the defendants were accepted as true only when they supported the prosecution.
It was taking the commandant there six months to eliminate 80,000 Jews using monoxide gas. I had a better idea. One of my Auschwitz guards had accidentally sniffed a chemical disinfectant called Zyklon B and had passed out immediately. It occurred to me, if a little of this chemical killed lice enough, perhaps, would kill a human. I tested it on Soviet prisoners of war locked in a room, and it worked.
Just as well. I hear the Americans are very poor shots. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must write a letter. For the rest of my life, Herr Reichsmarschall people will ask me what your final thoughts were. I'll have nothing to tell them. You can tell them this:
You saw today that I'm not up to this task. I could stay, out of pride, and unravel everything we've all worked so hard for. Or I can step aside-- Bob, you are this trial. Everything it is, everything it represents, is from inside you. Your thoughts, your values.
The future pays for it. He's started selling the grain reserves. This can't be true. He's selling Rome's reserves of grain. The people will be starving in two years.
The mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything. Listen to me. My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate. But while the people follow him no one would dare stand up to him until you.
And what is Rome, Maximus? I've seen much of the rest of the world. It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light. Yet you have never been there.
The family does not exist. We are the orphans of the cinema. Without our films, we do not exist. We are not humans, but a giant projector and our blood is the film we will show the world. My life began in the cinema.
Cecil should eliminate more assholes. As critics who write bogus stuff for promos. Or those fuckers that come when the film has already begun. Join the revolution against Hollywood movies. Maintain the guerrillas in District halls and punish those blocking entertainment you love.
- Can you tell us your name? - Well, my name's Heather. - Can you tell us what you're doing out here all alone? Well, yeah, sure. My boyfriend and I were just, like, making out... and then we heard a noise out there, so he went to go check it, but--well, that was, like, ten minutes ago.
Having power over another man? Your wig. You'll no longer spread your insidious gospel. From now on, you will not even write... ... yourownignominiousname.
The rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, abbé. I've been to hell, young man. You've only read about it. I am sorry, Marquis. Truly.
We produce books for the discriminating collector. The compulsive inmates set the type. The listless ones do the binding and prepare the ink. it's remarkable, doctor. The patients are so subdued, so docile.
Monsieur Prouix is the court's most promising young architect. He's at your disposal. The place hasn't been occupied since the Terror. it has possibilities, yes. I'm to live here?
Madeleine, my sweet. Can you smuggle me a quill and some ink? I don't dare. The doctor's got his eye on you sharper than ever now. Dr. Montalivet was, politely put, diminutive.
Mr. Ayala first came to see me in January. That would have been 1987. He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor. I didn't ask too many questions. I am a businessman also. I was the company's secretary from 1991 to 1994.
In my heart, I'd love to say that we were getting 60 or 70%. In the reality, we're more like 40 or 50% of the total that's approaching us. And it's all big-dollar issues now. That's the reason you're seeing a lot of these murders taking place. It's one organization fighting another organization. When things are good, people don't kill each other.
I can't even begin to tell him where you are... and when you're coming home, if you're ever coming home. Helena... we're gonna get through this. I promise. - I'll make it up to you. - Do you have any idea what's going on out here? Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.
I was the company's secretary from 1991 to 1994. I supposedly worked for all six companies, but they weren't... I mean, it was just an empty office with a desk and a telephone. I never sold anything the whole time I was there. Sometimes people came in, and they got paid.
He's not in danger. He's a fine actor, but all this preparation, it's... very strange. You think it is strange enough for him to go so deep inside his character that- that he forgets he's Max Schreck altogether? God knows I forgot. Schreck's peculiarities are like lovemaking games.
When was the last time you saw a river catch on fire? You think they care if anyone got hurt? I'd love to find a way to give those Mages some payback. "Ridley the Savior." That'll be the day.
And then something would happen. Or nothing would happen. And I'd get that feeling. And you all know what that feeling is. When your skin is screaming and your hands are shaking and your stomach feels like it wants to jump through your throat.
- A crock of shit. - They're happy. They're not happy. No adult human being is happy. People are born.
When you threw the ball, what were you thinking about? I don't know. The mating habits of African ants. I don't know. The striped thing. You were thinking about hitting the mattress. Well, you know, it might sound funny to you, but that's all wrong.
300 thousand pounds. Approximately. Bastard! You know that plant... I'm looking after for you? - How much is it worth? - It hasn't died, has it?
This is a... This is Springy Head Guy. It's you. Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
You okay? My mother loved her roses. She would just stare at them for hours breathing them in. They only bloom once a year at the end of the summer. She always said that's what made them special.
I believe girls should know that all things are possible. My wife believed that. Were you ever married? No. And it's too bad, cos I look awesome in a wedding dress.
- He doesn't come any more. - Really? But I came to see you. Casey, last night... you had water in your eyes.
I'm gonna miss ya, brother. Give me a hug, handsome. Boy, you better send me a shit load of dope. First thing, man. Get some of the smokes to T.J. You can have the rest.
Ain't nobody ever liked you anyway. Mama liked me just fine. Break it up over there. - Hey, what's up? The trash truck.
Earl wasn't gonna give it up. I wanna tell you about Earl Copen. Earl Copen had a set of balls on him from the day he come in this joint. He knew he couldn't handle this boy one-on-one. So he went up on a catwalk and got one of them big steel mop buckets. He filled it up with water. When this motherfucker was walkin' by, Earl aimed at it, dropped it and let it go.
I didn't mean try it in the car, Sol, you arsehole! What are you gonna do with that, pick his teeth? Wipe the butter off and put it away. There's a proper blade back there. Cows have only been domesticated in the last 8000 years.
But really, he's like my brother. What do I know about diamonds? I'm a boxing promoter. I was a happy boxing promoter until a week ago, and then: What do I know about diamonds?
Oh, dogs. Sure, I like dags. - I like caravans more. - You're very welcome. Pikeys are well-known for their skills of negotiation in business.
I like that one, Errol. I'll remember that next time I climb off your mum. - Not now. - Gonna be a tragedy of a fight. Be a nice one. Hell of a way to be a war.
That is when I thought the pikey had money riding on himself. That's why the bastard never goes down when he's supposed to. We've been tucked up while he's been cleaning up. We're worse off now than when we started. The next day we went to the campsite but the gypsies had disappeared during the night.
- I ain't happy. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Stand on me. Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it. Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.
Oh, my Larry. Are you kidding me? Kick him out now while you got the chance, sister. I guess you had to be there. You are this incurable romantic, like, thwarted back to 1955, where you think you are his first love.
Emotional. Love energy. Hate energy. - It's very potent stuff, you know. - Really? Cheeseman worked with fruit flies, and then he realized they didn't have enough emotional energy.
Sammy, it's okay. We're going to get you a good doctor. Baby, it's all right. It's gonna be okay. We're going to get you a TLE specialist. Those cheap bastards.
A death for which he may feel some responsibility. And if I'm right exacerbated by the Temporal Lobe Epilepsy this seems as real to him as you and I sitting here. But since he can't actually go into the past and save his sister he's brilliantly created a ritual whereby he can at least atone for her death. The ritual of saving your life. He said he didn't stick around for the trial, right?
- Hello, Freshman. Senator, I just wanted to steal a couple of seconds. What? See what whores do on their time off? Listen, I know the things I've done.
- That's the way Jerry Ford did it with Rockefeller. I always thought it was pretty damn classy. Have we notified the networks? Oh, yes. All the pundits are in a guessing feeding frenzy.
Look, I don't mind she's a woman... but I'm not confirming a woman just because she's a woman. Laine Hanson has an extra burden. She's has to come on the world stage with perfect credentials. Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect credentials. The world respected her.
Good. Good man. Good man. I think if I make the rounds, do the Sunday morning talk shows... raise the level of the game a bit, outtalk her on the issues- Issues?
Then this would all be moot, 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir. You know what? Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team. Who the fuck cares? You just look those bastards in the eye and tell them exactly that.
You know what? Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team. Who the fuck cares? You just look those bastards in the eye and tell them exactly that. These guys, they're gonna confirm you.
I will not dignify those remarks or your questions with a response. Good evening. The guy's a jerk. We're never gonna put our people on that show again. Some asshole called in and made this idiot claim.
- No witnesses? - Pure urban legend. A little bit of wishful thinking thrown in, I think. You know, Laine... you could've looked those pricks in the eye and told them the truth. Under oath.
I'm talking about those of you who were patriots to your party... but traitors that of righteousness, the truth... the concept of making the American dream blind to gender. And you know, I am not free of blame. Right from the start I should've come down here... pointed a finger your way- pointed a finger your way... and asked you, "Have you no decency, sir?" Yesterday... I met- Mr. Runyon... you may walk out on me, you may walk out on this body... but you cannot walk out on the will of the American people.
You know why? Because someday, years from now, you're gonna come in here with your family... and you're gonna look up at my painting... and you'll be able to say to them, your kids and grandkids... "Way back then I defied my president. It cost me my reelection, kept me out of politics forever. I was on the track to maybe one day end up here... destined to make the kind of changes in this country... that only great men, given the right time and place, can make... and I have none of that now, but that's okay... because I did what was in my heart."
- Mr. Lewis, you do not have speaking privileges. Mr. Chairman, I find your term, "propensity for abortion"... misrepresentative of my position. I have a propensity for a woman's right to choose. - To abort a child! -A fetus.
Hardly know you've got it on. Bond Street. Two and a half grand. You like this tiepin, don't you? Here. Have it. Hi.
I have no idea. Does she want to get back together? Define "get back together." -Love is love, and sex is sex. -Exactly.
That fascist son of a bitch . I could sue for that humiliation . I never win stuff like that. It's a dollar. What can you lose?
Are you ready for dessert? -No dessert. -Yes! So, do you guys have any grandchildren? My grandparents have been married 50 years.
I'll be right back. What do you think you're doing , you motherfucking fuck? There was a man on table two who had a ring he wanted us to put into a creme brulee. It wasn't there. The only other creme brulee went to your table.
- To get me down. I was already down. Who's plotting against me? It's not against you, it's against all actors. But why actors?
Hello, Dussolier. How about that prostate? [Note: I know women do not have them, but that's what he says! Olga] Sometimes it bothers me. We'll have to remove it. Of course, it is not cancerous, but ... without being pessimistic, it might become.
Is it cold? What d'you mean? I'm asking you if it is cold. What? The statue!
I can't believe he just lied to my face like that. I actually thought he liked me. How could he do that? Wait, she was standing around topless? Girls just don't stand around naked.
Dr. Weir cloned you. They found us. Shoot me in the head. - What- - We have people at Weir's lab!
So I can understand your unique perspective? No. So you can go fuck yourself. Now you'll tell us where you put Mr. Drucker's syncording! You won't find it in my head.
Add a pinch of religion, cover and let simmer you got yourself a messy war. -Could spread a full-scale war. -No, it's just a... -What? A police action? No. Just ethnic skirmishes.
Our strategy was to smash Vukovar and cross the Drava river... Once we got to the other side, we could probably be free. -They burned my house. -Who did this? I don't know. I didn't recognized the uniforms.

Jack, the keys. -Front door-- -We know how to get in. -Have a good one. -Have a great time. Bring home the blue ribbon!
This is a good, safe product, doesn't have bad odor chemical smell for small stains, usually small dogs Pomeranian, your little teacup Poodle, what have you. This is a good product. Sometimes, your bigger dog, your Great Dane, your Bull Mastiff, Rottweiler you need to up the ante a little bit. This is another good cleaning product. For the big critters, the big stains sometimes you need the nuclear weaponry, the sodium hydrochloride.
I'm the chief hostage negotiator for the Akron and tri-county area. I talk people down. When they get a jumper on a building, they call me. How many people have you talked down? I mean, is there a...?
But she... It made me understand that I am irreplaceable. It's really disturbing. This is my life especially me alone I am the only one count. Do not ask me why. I know it's... awful to admit,
For what it's worth, Bruce couldn't have chosen anyone better to put on the mask. Coming from you, that means everything. Sometimes the important things go unsaid. If there's one thing I've learned you've got to appreciate the people in your life while you have the chance. Not everyone is capable of expressing that, Tim.
-That was it, wasn't it? I want you to give back the Batman suit. What? Why? There is no reason for you to continue.
I hate a man who can't guess for himself. Leave, I'm tired of doing all the work. - I've guessed, and I'll go. - He's guessed, now he's leaving. How dense can he be? Let him leave and take Lélio with him.
And pretty? - Pretty? The word doesn't do her justice. She's charming, beautiful and worthy of me. Love! A treat for my soul!
We will not go into war sober. We will go into war with a smile on our faces! Bloated and exalted with Alcopops! Mr. Spottiswoode speaking from the embassy. We will come back when we have more information.
The Pale Child of the Astral Plane that represents existence... I saw her! For a brief moment, ...in that cab. And she seemed to be dying. Provincial detectives laugh at me behind my back because I rely on the spirit world ...to bring criminals to justice. They call me "Mystic Meg".
- Who are you? - It is I. - I will lead you. - Where? The answer is different but the questions are important ...her vagina that smells of the fish of Hades!
- Kom... what? - Komatsu. Maybe, I'm too old for the journey. My flesh is old. But my spirit is young!
We did everything to get rid of Nancy that was physically possible. I even dangled her out of a window one night, by her ankles. And the rest of the band hated me... 'cause I was with the New York Dolls -- Johnny and Jerry, and they were junkies. They definitely brought a lot of heroin around, too. And I know Sid was totally into Johnny Thunders.
I even dangled her out of a window one night, by her ankles. And the rest of the band hated me... 'cause I was with the New York Dolls -- Johnny and Jerry, and they were junkies. They definitely brought a lot of heroin around, too. And I know Sid was totally into Johnny Thunders. I like the New York Dolls, 'cause they were nasty and mean, and they wore makeup, and they didn't give a shit.
I thought he was the coolest thing ever -- Thunders, at that time. I started stealing some of his stances, and his looks, and, you know, his moves on stage. I look back at it now, and I'm embarrassed at how much I fucking was trying to copy him. I didn't need to do that. I had my own thing already. My invention to the Sex Pistols was the hanky on the head.
# The berlin wall # I thought "Holidays in the Sun" was our crowning glory. # Sensurround sound in a two-inch wall # # I was waiting for the communist call # # I didn't ask for sunshine and I got World War Ill #
This week on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert... The incredible Kansas... Family Funk from the Sylvers... The outrageousness of the Sex Pistols. Some slick dealing from Ricky Jay, and funnyman Robert Aguayo. We had trouble getting our visas 'cause we had criminal records, all of us.

Some slick dealing from Ricky Jay, and funnyman Robert Aguayo. We had trouble getting our visas 'cause we had criminal records, all of us. They strip-searched us at the airport, and thank god Sid was the first one they strip-searched, 'Cause as soon as they've seen his underwear... That was it, we were safe. They had no wish to play with the rest of our willies after that point.
Sid would sit next to me, and we'd look out the window, and we'd stare at that endless scenery, and imagine John Wayne and the indians. You wouldn't sleep. You wouldn't want to, because it was so first time. Steve and paul flew around America with Malcolm. Steven, what kind of badge you got? I don't know. Safety department.
Lack of money. The arse of your pants falls out, you just use safety pins. And I always used to call him "rotten," 'cause his fucking teeth were like, dreadful, they looked like dog-ends, and -- itjust stuck. Steve always looked like a hairdresser on the high road.
It will. It will be wonderful. I'm ready to go now, OK? Is this right? No, no, you've got to cut on the corners like this. How do you like these almonds?
I'm ready to go now, OK? Is this right? No, no, you've got to cut on the corners like this. How do you like these almonds? Are they chopped fine enough?
Serge? Mortal sin... is sin whose object is... committed by... deliberate...consequence. Incorrect. Didi? Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter... which is committed with full knowledge... and deliberate consent. Correct. So, how do you know... if the coverture is properly tempered?
Jesus, it's really great seeing you. Hey, baby! Did you buy the booze? Have you stopped wearing the necklace? No, I just take it off in the shower.
Swam? What do you mean, swam? How did you get here? Borrowed a car... - You stole a car?
We'll talk later Fine then, where should I meet you? 7:30, at this Indian restaurant on Wyndham St I'll see you there Don't worry, men are like this
It's the Box er helmet I also have one in silver What bike do you ride? Is it a full-fairing? V-4 engine
A courtesan's daughter... The nobles would die of laughter if they heard this. Hey, Chief Penal Official! -Yes, sir. -Bring her to me now! the soldiers are on their way
She's crazy. Is she doing this out of some spite against Chunhyang? What is she doing? In Chinju, a courtesan named Uiam died for her country In Pyongyang, a courtesan named Wolson killed an enemy general The people in Andong worships the shrine of lljinhong Who fed her husband with her flesh to save him
Let's go. She's dying because of me, so can't I see her? You can't go now. The governor is so strict, no man can bring food to her. Even a male dog can't go there.
The night is late. Let's sleep. -I don 't want to. -Listen to me and come here. They say for a married couple... ever-lasting happiness depends on the first night. But if you grab the wife's hand, they say it's bad luck.
I thank Virgilio for this book. He gave me a lesson in literature and editing. ...my brothers Juan and Nicholas are writers too. Oh, come on. Pepe, we've got the Bronte sisters in the back-seat. Look at them. Lezama is a Catholic; Virgilio is an atheist.
I just got a job now in the National Library, but I would like to be a writer. You poor thing. A country boy in Havana to serve the Revolution. - Where's your mother? - En la bodega. Give me the key.
Overripe and beautiful! That's fruit from heaven! I half-feel like interfering, but it is none of my business, it's their fruit. This one's almost pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy. Anyway, half the people are stingy.
They go as soon as the storm has abated. A high sea over the beds is a pretty sight but to profit from the low tide gleaners need a copy of the Tide Tables. We come every year for the lowest tide. They're going to follow the receding sea and anything they find they pick up. People collect the oysters that have come loose.
They are too close. Here the oyster farmers let them carry on, but... it degenerates sometimes. We don't trespass! The limit must be here, but... we encroach a little sometimes. We're not stupid. We see others and do the same.
To collect up to 7 pounds each, nothing more. - 1 0 yards away minimum. 1 1 pounds per person. 7 pounds of clams and 1 1 pounds of oysters, something like that. 1 1 pounds per person, I think.
I half-felt like talking to him. Further on, along the Rhone, in a blissful orchard I saw gleaners arrive. You can tell them from their boxes, sacks and plastic bags which don't look anything like the standard containers of the workers. My name's David, I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.
It's a staple food full of proteins and glucids. It's strange to be concerned... - About balanced diets? - Yes. Since I studied biology, it's quite normal I should be concerned. I used to be a teaching assistant.
What? Water? That's all we have. It's over there. That's our tap. - What if it freezes?
I'm moving towards emptiness now, or rather, towards lessness. As much lessness as possible. - You're still a long way away! Right now, I store up things because I know I will need to recycle some. The encounter happens on the street.
Turn and face me! He won't. I spotted some wheat behind that chap, and behind the robot, I discovered a painting on gleaning. It contained both the humble stooping of Millet's Glaneuses and the proud posture of Breton's Gleaner. The painter had an old dictionary at hand. Honest, this is no movie trick, we really did find these Glaneuses purely by chance.
- Fourth. - And you? - The penthouse. - What is it? - I don't know.
- Yes. - You bought a car? You didn't know? You gotta see it. You'll love it.
I knew she wouldn't give up, she couldn't stand it and that she'd be in contact sometime. For a moment of madness, what a price to pay. It's all the same in the end. I've paid for it and I may pay for it all my life. I'll split the slut's skull "this very evernirng".
Valuska. Come on. Show us. Let's make some room for Valuska to show us! You are the Sun.
I'm living in the summer kitchen. Because that woman... and the police chief have taken it on themselves to move in and have taken the whole place over. But we'll get by all right with the summer kitchen outside. The sofa with the green blanket will be yours. In the top part of the cupboard I'll make some space for you. The windows will have to be done.
They're still there today, silent yet ominous reminders of the way in which war intrudes itself on ordinary human life. And yet that life has an amazing stubbornness. The guns may thunder, but the fields must still be harvested. The geese have to cross the road, even if it's choked with military traffic. The ordinary skein of human life goes on, and our cameramen recorded that, too.
If it was, I'd get something where at least the American wouldn't be readily recognized. I was concerned about their family that would see somebody in the newsreels. [Hanks] But Paris was nearly at hand, less than three months after D day. As the liberators approached, the Communist-led underground rose against the Germans. In the streets, the German tanks were opposed by members of the resistance carrying only small arms.
I was concerned about their family that would see somebody in the newsreels. [Hanks] But Paris was nearly at hand, less than three months after D day. As the liberators approached, the Communist-led underground rose against the Germans. In the streets, the German tanks were opposed by members of the resistance carrying only small arms. Amazingly, they forced an uneasy truce.
Some smiled and some just stared straight ahead... and I guess tried to make the best of what they were faced with. [Hanks] The Allies had first intended to bypass Paris, but it was unavoidably in their path. Most of these soldiers did not stop. For them, Paris was just a quickly glimpsed place on the road to victory. In a smaller French city, Fred Bornet found the joy of liberation more freely expressed and more directable.
Most of these soldiers did not stop. For them, Paris was just a quickly glimpsed place on the road to victory. In a smaller French city, Fred Bornet found the joy of liberation more freely expressed and more directable. [Bornet] The people were out in the street, and they were just absolutely ecstatic. Hysterical with delight.
Ailing with flu, he took refuge in the basement of a command post. He sent his driver and stills man for more film, then fell asleep. He did not hear the order to evacuate the C.P. When it came under fire. [Wood] My still guy at that time was a new guy, a replacement. And he told the driver, whose name was Ivan Babcock,
As a soldier in the American Army, I had no knowledge of these camps and had not heard anything about it. [Mainzer] It was horrible. There was bodies stacked up like cordwood. We judged them to be about 60 to 80 pounds in weight, and people were actually dying, day by day, even after the camp was liberated.
Rather innocently, Lloyd Durant decided to shoot a film on combat cameramen here. What better subject to put on film than the story of the combat cameraman, who was practically unknown at the time. We knew that our next operation was coming off in the Pacific. So I said, "Let me go out there, "let me find the cameramen we have out there, "and presumably they will be in on the action, whatever it may be, So we hit the beach at Okinawa.
[Hanks] Yet we do. These pictures have been duplicated in every war for over a half century. The children reach out to us in their abandonment, their incomprehensible loneliness. The soldiers offer what comfort they can. These men and these children share the terrible bond of war.
And at that moment I realized that my job was to take pictures, and that's what I had to do. [Hanks] These stills and the perfectly matched movie footage helped fill some of the gaps left by the lost D day pictures. Tragically, Val Pope would be killed in action a few days later. [Rosenblum] The well-known picture of that sequence was this young lieutenant who was bending over a GI, giving him first aid. He looked like the most heroic fellow I'd ever seen in my life.
We are told these lives were traded for the many more that would have been lost on both sides in an invasion of Japan. But all we know for sure is that the atomic bombs brought the war to an abrupt end and finally stopped all the killing at over 40 million. [Hanks] At Nagasaki, as at the concentration camps, the combat photographers had one last service to render. Dan McGovern speaks for all those who entered this charnel house. My effort was... to show the world what the atomic bomb had done to a nation.
[Hanks] Bates followed the tank into battle, and, scrambling for position, got this great footage of armored combat. [Bates] I heard our T-26 coming up. The first shot went in and cut the legs off of the tank commander in the Tiger. In the film you can see the armor-piercing shell going through the bottom of the picture. Immediately, the driver and bow gunner, they climbed out, but the second shot shrapnel had gotten them, too.
Immediately, the driver and bow gunner, they climbed out, but the second shot shrapnel had gotten them, too. The concussion from that 90-millimeter gun is so tremendous that it would just blow me off my picture, and I'd have to get back on it again. I couldn't use a tripod. I had to hand hold it. The tank commander that had his legs cut off just laid on top of his tank and burned up in front of the camera. That thing was burning even the next morning.
Don't you ever go out? Yes, I do. But he was an innocent person. You sure? No innocents here, they're all guilty!
Those guys worked for him as hit men. He got knocked off. Now everyone up in the hills is out of work. So he was "a good provider for the people." Poor Pablo. They don't let anyone get ahead here.
Now you write what you want out of life. I hate goddamn cab drivers with loud radios! You should've told him to turn it off. My policy for living in peace in this war zone is: look, listen and shut up. And no one will change my mind.
And no one will change my mind. What about the phone? Does it work? I don't know. And I don't care. I don't call anybody and nobody calls me.
Target at the centre of the warehouse, over. Where did your people get to? I don't know They never called in. Oh, no? Should we take a body count while we wait?
Like this. Surprise, surprise. It doesn't work. You know, all right! My first guess is they put this job up for grabs and offered a cut-rate deal to the lowest bidder. You see that bullet-proof glass out there?
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Let's go to the park. What did you have to go and do that for? Now I've lost credibility with those kids.
Look. it really isn't your fault. Now, don't worry. Yeah. But if I hadn't taken the egg with me... No, we're the ones to blame. It was because of the plasma experiment.
And also guarantee you a high position. I cannot deny that. But every country must have its secret research projects. We did shut down the generator. I don't get it.
We'll go to the opera school in a few days. You still want to talk to him? OK, you decide. You still got that photo up? The photo was mother's idea.
If one believes in Him. And you claim that faith is love. As He doesn't seem to love me, what should I do? Ask for His love. I'm quite happy He does not love me, though.
That's all. It's most important not to make things worse. Primum non nocere. Let nature take its course. Nature evolves toward death, dear colleague.
What? I said boil some water! Hurry up and have him already! Once more, push! Keep pushing, again!
What are you doing? Don't be a fool. We're twins. Like the two towers. I'm looking for those stars, like you said.
If you don't, why the hell did you call me? Iced tea and coffee. - Hot coffee. So, can we get back together again? What for?
Alright, check it out. It's a body, sir. Nonzee district, over. We've got a body at Sam Saen. We need forensics down here.
Check out this gorgeous new lipstick I bought! Let me show you You're always scaring me like that! Jung, take these sausages... .. to Aunty Nee in Bangkok as usual, will you? Take them straight to her as soon as you get there
Being a drag queen like us What? What's so bad about being two sexes in one, honey? You haven't gotten over it yet, have you, Mon? You oughta know by now those stupid sports clubs will never let queen on the team
I saw her from a distance. She was wearing our colors in her hair. That's how she spoke to the people. I voted for her, she was elected and went to parliament. The day Leyla went to parliament the eyes of the Kurds were fixed on the television.
At first, I wanted to die too, but... If I died, who'd go to see my son? For him I am alive. Why don't they think about the feelings of the people whose children are going to be executed? All we're asking for is clemency that they treat those people like human beings.
You've suffered so much for us. You opened our eyes for us. After all they had suffered, the Kurdish women wanted a woman to get into parliament. That way, their voices would be heard. When the elections came round, I said to her "I'm going to make a dress and a headscarf for you.
"I take this oath for the brotherhood between the Turkish people and the Kurdish people." Just a few words in Kurdish, and what a price! This is a conspiracy. What I am defending is perfectly clear. I don't accept any of these accusations.
Tell me one thing. Knowing my wife's sexual preferences - I would have thought that she would reject a rope binder like you. Oh no, she is capable of being a masochist, sir. I thought she would be too. Intelligent women have a vast imagination.
Okay then. You can go now. Someone who gets hurt, always hurts another What are you waiting for? Didn't I tell you to go? She's drunk out of her mind.
The moonlight is dimmer. The black moon will be up soon. We've got to hurry. Wake up! Wake up!
By the way, a man in unit 3-4 has been complaining about stray cats. He's always calling, demanding us to take catch those beasts. Are we supposed to catch stray cats as well? Who the hell's in charge of Units 3, 4? Smudged bills have been delivered there.
Didn't mommy tell you to be quiet? Mister, I'm leaving the money here. Hello, tax form, ma'am. Temperature for today, highs at 33 degree Celsius, current temperature at 27 degree Celsius. You are listening to 'Good Morning, Seoul'.
She's regal. She's literally like a statue, a living statue. She's very statuesque... and I think comes off great in the film. Cut! Mel's a good director of actors because he's a really good, excellent actor. That's my supposed sphere of expertise so I try and make it as comfortable for them as I can.
He did fight for the English. The nobility was famous for just switching sides. Whatever worked for them, they'd do it. There was no sense of that unity that Wallace had. They changed sides like people change their underpants.
The good news is that all that hard labour paid off. I think that Mel's made a terrific film. It's a wonderful story. I can't believe no one's written a story about this man before, because he's so passionate. I think it's important that people know about this man.
I think that Mel's made a terrific film. It's a wonderful story. I can't believe no one's written a story about this man before, because he's so passionate. I think it's important that people know about this man. I hope that they can't talk at the end of it.
I can't believe no one's written a story about this man before, because he's so passionate. I think it's important that people know about this man. I hope that they can't talk at the end of it. I hope that they're so moved and so inspired by it. That's all.
But Robert the Bruce was more like I think most of us are. He was a man who wanted to do the right thing but also tried to face the realities of life and make the necessary compromises. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead. We all will. It's a question of how and why.
So she wrote a play about it... I think so. The clue was the 'Numbers' code on the Blue-Eyed Angel' disk. 'Numbers'? Remember what those men in black hoods were saying?
Metcalfe! Why did you vanish from my sight? Father! I will not hate my father for the truth he has confessed. The truth is what saved my soul.
She sent me a picture of herself with him. Then when she got pregnant he wouldn't see her. I wanted to pay him back! Mr Thornhill wasn't the murderer. He wasn't?
And he told me : "There is no weapon." "We will only start with bows and arrows and stones and sticks." I did the training myself. The tactics, the tricks they're mine. And we made them, put everything into action and we captured two high-powered rifles.
I did the training myself. The tactics, the tricks they're mine. And we made them, put everything into action and we captured two high-powered rifles. The boys saw how I fought and they thought that I was a good leader, so they started following me. So that's how I ended up holding the position of the BRA. There are no clear front lines in the jungle.
Francis and his fellow villagers ended up having to go back to salvage anything not rooted in concrete. Because along with getting the Bougainvillians to start from scratch with food and medicine, the PNG DF forced open many of the houses, and gave them THAT problem to solve. We have to make our own locks so what we do is we go down to Panguna mine and get all the locks and strip them out and make our own keys. Using all the rubbish from the Panguna mine we can build good houses. As you can see, bits and pieces of light, lighting up our houses. Switchboxes.
That's Bolavi and that's where they end. They don't come any further. The PNG DF don't come any further, not just because they're beaten, but also because they hardly care anymore. In the war for hearts and minds, the BRA were always winning. And when no other country came to Bougainvillians aid, the people found support in a different realm.
The islanders' devotion seemed to pay off in early 1997 when God moved in one of his most mysterious ways. Papua New Guinea basically admitted defeat by hiring mercenaries to do what the PNG DF couldn't. It forked out 36 million dollars to the London-based company Sandline International, and presented the BRA with the biggest armed threat that it ever faced. And then, lo and behold, the PNG DF itself came to Bougainville's aid. Humiliated by the very idea of needing foreign troops, and even more angry at the price, the underfunded PNG soldiers rallied huge popular support, arrested the mercenaries, and threw them out.

It's beautiful. Not only is coconut oil far less polluting than diesel, you also get double the mileage. Ishmael laughs that after the war, they're really going to scare Esso and Shell. The coconut is helping to create a separate state for our island. If the coconut wasn't part of the revolution I can't think how we could create this state.
Is that peace ? This mining won't do. Because it gives problems to all future generations on Bougainville. And we don't want this to happen. We don't want our descendants to say :
We got a blessing. Gardens from here, it's no end. And you've got bush from the river up to another mountain. As you see, all the whole green. It's all over – that's Bougainville. Yet no plant from Bougainville comes close to the importance of the coconut.
That really happen,or did I hallucinate it? That really happened. Where the hell is the sanctity? People get married for green cardsor tax purposes. It's supposed to mean something.
Well, who are the shoes for? Well, if you must know -- you. Ha ha ... Me? Yes. Put them on.
Elaine? Y-you look like ... Miss Hathaway. Billy can change. So can I. Hi! Morning, everybody! ... Oh, I just said "Morning," Didn't say it was good. Nelle, while I have you, and just out of curiosity -- how do you think the women here regard me?

! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry! Sorry! The long night has come
Well, maybe for you. But those are plants and people. This isn't alive. It's, like, switches and stuff... They're tools ways to interact with the slipstream.
A small down payment. Not bad. I still need to swipe a high capacity circuit board. You made quite an impression on the web. They're already calling you "the human armory."
- OK? Bye. Bye. Oh, look - redial. What's all this?
That's it - she remembers and I'm not allowed to. Customers! Why didn't you lock the door? - We can make some money. - But they're students.
I have been looking all over for you. Thank you for choosing to shop at the Magic Box. Please do come again. Did you see that? Real live customers.
- Buffy? I'm glad I've caught you. We may have underestimated what we're dealing with. Go on. We've uncovered more than expected about this orb. It's called the Dagon Sphere and it has a history going back many centuries.
Already, you know what I seek. I have given you form. Now find for me the Key. Seek it out in the holy places. Yes, yes, yes.
Not much, until we determine if the tumour's operable, which we are working on. is there something that I...? I mean, can I help? There's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments that are very promising.
Let's see if I remember. Mate in four. You almost got me that time, Rupert. Xander, Willow and Anya, you back up Buffy. I'll be the surprise guest.
So we're saying he did a spell just to make us think he was cool? Yes. That is so cool. Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this nightmare thing. Are they gonna be OK? It seems the wellbeing of this creature is linked to Jonathan.
Now, let's see about getting Karen a ride home. I wish you'd get rid of that body. The smell's makin' me hungry. You wouldn't want it. It had a blood disease.
He get thrown? Officer: Didn't find anybody. I'm thinking DUl. You calling it? I'm calling that beer bottle.
- Can you think of anything else? - Mist. I've checked everywhere. - I can't figure out what happened. - I'm telling you, it is the witches.
Give it up. If War's not back soon, we're history. The Source is going to burn us off the map. We are not going down alone. Instead of just standing here, let's go hunt those witches down and kill them.
- He had help. - From whom? A pigeon, perhaps? Maybe a penguin to the rescue? Witches!
I understand how past Phoebe was killed, but not why killing her is going to kill you. Because of the curse. The cousins didn't wanna risk past Phoebe and Anton getting back together again in any lifetime. Anton was... Is immortal.
Think you could work your magic on the Charmed Ones? You said sisters, not witches. But they are sisters first and foremost. And that, I believe, is their Achilles' heel. Break that bond, and we break the very foundation of their powers.
Troxa, cool your jets. I came to apologize. Apologize, for what? Pissing you off, for one thing. I don't want to be always looking over my shoulder, waiting for you to strike for the rest of eternity.
"Lesbian Spunk Inferno" opens with five lesbian filmmakers, a collective, you might say, who are having a competition to see who can make the best lesbian film. - Filmmakers. - Yeah. Independent filmmakers. Meaning? They're not the kind of girls who wonna deal with the studio bosses, the focus groups, all that industry shmoozing.
She'll be off in a second. -We're not really gonna be able to stay. -What do you mean? -Because.... -l've got a skin problem right now.
-l'm trying to get us home. You're not trying hard enough. I don't know where we're going. I don't have any directions. A good idea is just to keep driving around and around.
It takes four hours to get a CBC. They're 40 behind. - You look bad. - I look better than I feel. No beds, we're boarding 7 patients. Carol called in 2 registry nurses.
When we call for a consult, we need you to do just that. Well, thank you for the clarification. - What's this? - Some things we need downstairs. Well, these "things" belong to the O.R.
- He's wanted for murder. Lucky I recognized him. - Once a cop, always a cop. - This is not a police department. They can observe him in the jail ward.
I've already been here three hours. How long is this gonna take? - What are you doing here? - Looking for Weaver. She's under the impression I'm her personal temp. - She's next door. - Thanks.
This is a modified version of Ken Blackburn's 1998 world-record design. - You sure you want to launch it? - It's folded paper until you let it fly. - All right. Let it fly. - All right. - Wow! - That looks like it could go on forever.
They expected us to do their dirty work for them and be long dead by now. Only their precious plants would remain. How did you survive? M'Lee? In the end we only had each other. And then Br'nee's people arrived...
Please come quickly as soon as you can. There's a creature here. - Could this be a Peacekeeper trick? - Yes, that's entirely possible. No, the transmission source is coming from an asteroid close by.
Dried food rectangles. - That's it? - That's it. A thousand units of them. Crackers? You just bought crackers? Don't start.
Zhaan has decided to test T'raltixx's device on your module. Wonderful. Wouldn't want to use your Prowler, would we? Well, no thanks to you, the module has Moya modifications on it, so we can monitor and verify the results. The central device I'll make for Moya will be much larger, yes of course.

Maximizing! Your honor, are you going to believe the protestations of an obviously guilty man, or the very symbol of your law, your world, your truth? Arrest Ja Rhumann. All charges against Zotoh Zhaan, are dropped. The prisoner... is free... to go.
The Light of Truth is a parable! A parable? But it says it so in your own ancient text Your honor, it's ordinary wood Oh, a lot of truth is only ordinary wood.
It appears as though our options on how to resolve this have become limited. We are not giving up. Look at the data, Zhaan. I'm thinking with more speed and clarity than I ever have before, and I'm still only able to absorb a fraction of this. Something may reveal itself.
Aren't you special? With an attitude like that, do you really think you're the best of the three of us? You know I am. Yeah, you're fantastic. You're gonna fit in great around here. The rest of the crew's just gonna love ya.
Pilot! This can't be! It... it appears that the sphere is generating some sort of... interdimensional portal! Whoa, whoa! This blob is creating a dimensional hole?
At gunpoint if you have to, but get me to the maintenance bay! At gunpoint. I don't know that it is going to work, Mister Rygel, I'm just going on a gut instinct. Something I'm sure you can appreciate.

Yeah. Mine, too. Don't worry about it. No. Mine are mental, OK? They're looking for a reason to sell my Gremlin. - They are? - God, they're such cheap bastards!
Thanks a lot. I'm not paying for that. I'm just here while they fix my place. Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay? I have never had a problem with it.
Wait. Don't go. I want to discuss with you the memorial garden we talked about. Is it possible we could meet around 3:00, 3:30? That sounds good. Thank you, Father.
Please tell the court what you found with regard to jump ready lights. I found the ready lights fully operational. So no frayed insulation, open wires, stuck relays, intermittent connections? No, ma'am. Fully operational.
No, ma'am. Fully operational. The pilot and the flight crew testified that they did not switch the light from red to green. - So how could the light have been on? - It couldn't.
Never mind. I'll call back. - The jump light was green. - You saw it? The light was green, ma'am.
Are you gonna enter the entire report into evidence? You may proceed, commander. Mr. Hoskins, you wanna tell us what happened at Kang So Ri? Yes, sir. It had been raining.
Civilians or combatants, sounds like Vietnam. A full generation earlier. Find what witnesses you can, examine documents. It sounds like everyone would be happier if we find nothing, sir. Everyone but me.
On occasion. And it was always consensual. Never used your position as high priest to press them into it? No, sir. Never extended the initiation ceremony to include a sexual one, chief? No.
I've got great deals here. Oh, yeah, actually I'm looking for a gift for the wifey. Could I see those 2 cameras right there? These are both excellent. I have them both at home. Does, uh, this one have a zoom? Yes, it does.
Oh, yeah, actually I'm looking for a gift for the wifey. Could I see those 2 cameras right there? These are both excellent. I have them both at home. Does, uh, this one have a zoom? Yes, it does. But it doesn't say zoom on the sticker.
It's the only way we can afford this building. I also do light maintenance and my husband's the weekend super. These are the detectives investigating that man's murder. I can't believe it happened. - How do you find the parties in 3B?
Officer Bandolini. My representative is not gonna be happy about this. I realise I'm bending procedure here. I appreciate you meeting with me. - You know we need that tape.
- Sex. - Number two. - Number one is Pam Anderson. - Pam is over 18, those girls aren't. They could be faked.
It scares me. Honey, it scares me too but I can't just walk in and restrain the guy. Why not? These predators, tell me where they are. I can't hear 'em or see 'em.
Honey, it scares me too but I can't just walk in and restrain the guy. Why not? These predators, tell me where they are. I can't hear 'em or see 'em. But they're out there.
But the money was big. And it was real. So we started taking requests. They'd go, 'Get me a redhead. I want a flat-chested girl.' I don't know, these guys are freaks.
Withdrawn. Detective, how many people have you arrested in your career? - I don't know the exact number. - More than 100, correct? Probably.
She would be scorned as a vice-monger. What about her family? They've been here for years. Her family, like all the Afghan diplomats at the UN are holdovers from the previous government. They treated women like something more than just indentured servants.
He followed these women for weeks before he attacked them. - Is he invisible? - He follows them on his bike. He watches Creen with her grandma, learns her secret name. He sees Neal call her dog.
Or sit in worship with us. - Excuse me. - Please, don't do this. We all value - the separation of Church and State. - A man raped three women.
Anything except that. Doctor, we understand you'd like to protect their confidentiality but this is a rape-murder investigation. - That list won't help you. - Why not? These people don't have addresses. They're scattered all over the city.
- That list won't help you. - Why not? These people don't have addresses. They're scattered all over the city. Can we get the schedule of when they're due to come in for their medication? So they can be traumatized by the experience?
Yes. I understand if you're afraid of him. I bought that gun... to protect Mark against the neighborhood ignorants. They chase him and frighten him. They're obsessed, terrified... that he'll freak out and hurt them or their children.
Instead of hounding patients struggling with their disease you should be checking the subject of Maggie's thesis. Mark Nash. And why doesn't he fall under your protective cover? Mark Nash was non-compliant. He refused to take medication. I absolutely believe that medication and therapy give the best possible relief for schizophrenia. Maggie advocated a patient's right to choose.
Oh, I love a man with principles. You know, when I was first elected governor, crime was out of control. But we went to work, fighting for three strikes and you're out... That bastard's running for another term, after all the crap he's pulled. - I'm voting for him. - What?
Gloria, this is not about Cyril, and you know it. This could give Preston's mom and dad a chance to have closure. You could have closure. Closure? People always think I'm a nurse.
I wanna stop living every fucking day in fear. Hey, that's what being alive is all about, pal. It doesn't have to be. Chris, sometimes, most times I wish I could wipe away the past. I wish I could wipe away everything I've done, everything I've said that hurt the people I love.




You lost the taste of power, isn't that what you said? - Yeah. - You're outta this. Beginning of the day, the way to wisdom, the wish, the will to treat, to try, to trip. You can memorialize them hacks-- Shut the fuck up, already!
- Yes. And I plan to go to court and be there every day until we get justice. Oh and you're certain that we will get justice. I have a very good feeling about this. I think we're going to win.
Oh yeah? I had dinner last night with Preston's parents. It's been awhile since I'd seen them. Anyway, I mentioned your interaction program. Really?
What can you rage against? So you'll do anything to find a complication. I will not be made a slave to by the laws of this state, Beecher. Yeah, well, that's where you and I are different. Because I love the law.
I want you to know I tampered with the evidence. I couldn't find the murder weapon, so I went to the kitchen. I opened a drawer and took out a kitchen knife, I smeared it in the blood and I dropped it next to his body. His fingerprints are all over that knife. No.
Oh, man. I missed you. Me, too. Keller's back in Emerald City. Two love birds have reunited.
- How are you? - What are you doing? Anybody here from Cleveland? All right. Being free, even for a few hours, was so wonderful.
I thought you didn't believe Topolsky. - You want what Max and Liz have, don't you? - Well, yeah. I just thought we'd try it on our own. One step at a time. I hate this job.
He's been through enough. Just tell me what Valenti said to you again. It's not what he said. It's how he said it. And how he knew to be there. It's like he's on our side or something.
I always hate the first day at a new school. - Done this before? - Only about a hundred times. Everyone's always so nice. Is that a bad thing?
Now, you take me, for example. I'm the law. Now, most normal teenage boys might think of me as the enemy... always cracking down on them, waiting for them to make a mistake. On the other hand, I'm here to protect them. Just like I protected you from Hubble the other night.
I mean, we don't need that. We got my apartment, you know? - I guess I'll just have the special. - We're closing early. Do you mind missing the movie?
- I know. You know, could I, uh... could I get sick? I don't know anything. I don't even know who I am. You know, the... the mark went away because... because you touched it. Maybe...
Okay? - Okay. - What? Just, one moment I look at you, you're my baby girl... and the next minute, you're a young woman. Thank you.
- Thanks, Mom. There she is. - What are they doing in there? - Passing the mashed potatoes. So, Liz... what do your parents do?
I guess we should be going, then. - The night's not over. Aww. We'll have to do this again sometime, Liz. Are you okay? You know, that box...
It never hurts to double-check. It looks a lot worse than it really was. Yeah. From the damages, I'd say you had quite a fire here. - That must've been pretty scary. - Well, yeah. For a moment there, Sheriff, I wasn't sure what was gonna happen.
I love how they say "until recently". Meaning she quit her job once she found her soul mate /investment banker. It's so retro. I've got a rock on my finger. Now I can stop pretending to care about my career. Until recently, the bride had a life of her own.
"Marriage Incorporated: "How to apply successful business strategies to finding a husband". Chapter one: "How To Get Ahead By Giving Head". Fine! Make fun. It's a very smart book.
- They gonna love you. No, I'm not worried about that. Parents always think I'm adorable. - What's the problem? - Well...
- I was just trying to be less available. Really? You don't have to do everything I say. Well, you're here now. Can I introduce you to my parents?
My husband can't get it up. It would have been wiser to have had a cappuccino instead of that third martini. - I'm so frustrated. - Charlotte? Don't you ever just want to be pounded hard?
You gotta get them when their light's on. - Men I meet are flashing yellows. - or off duty. They can drive around for years and not be available. They shouldn't be allowed to get behind the wheel!
He couldn't see anything. It was impossible. Where are you in the dream? I'm there. I could observe everything. He's driving, and he starts to hyperventilate.
-Got you a ring. -Don't listen to him. He's jerked you around for years. -You're wasting your whole youth. -Ma... . Open it.
Hey, how have you been? Can't complain. - You look good. - Where did your friends go? - Tell them to come back, join us.
No, I should be apologizing to you. I was out of line. You're right. I never raised a child. I was robbed of that when Eugene took him back to Montreal.
What did your parents say about Saturday? The usual. Nothing. They're afraid I'll go bulimic again. Mine just "blah, blah, blah." Purge and they won't say anything.
I can't concentrate and if i can't concentrate, Then i can't win the debate tomorrow! The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job. Alright, look, When two people work closely for a long time,
That black, white, yellow, brown or whatever, we are all just people. And so, i am very excited to unveil Our new south park flag! Wait, i don't get it. No, see, there's people of all colors.
We've gotten enough deuterium to power the warp engines for another thousand light-years. Excellent. Something wrong? Uh, now that you mention it, there is something that I feel compelled to share with you in my capacity as Morale Officer. The crew seem a little on edge. Oh? They don't appear particularly anxious to me.
Did I ever tell you about the Salvoxia? If I say yes, will it prevent you from telling the story? It was a Talaxian freighter. Horrible tragedy. Happened nearly a century ago. After suffering a cascade failure, it began to lose life-support generators one by one.
Happened nearly a century ago. After suffering a cascade failure, it began to lose life-support generators one by one. Pretty soon, there wasn't enough air left to sustain the entire crew, so they began to draw lots. Can you imagine? Draw the short straw and you suffocate?
Makes me short of breath just thinking about it. Perhaps you should occupy your mind with pleasant thoughts, before you hyperventilate. Right. Pleasant thoughts. Pleasant thoughts. What did the bodies look like? I beg your pardon?
Maybe it's an alien life-form coming to get us. Haven't you learned anything about letting your imagination get the best of you? There. That little jolt was probably nothing more than our friend leaving the ship to go to a new home that the Captain found for him. Time to regenerate. What if the life-form didn't leave?
I will begin immediately. - Goin' somewhere with that stuff? - I thought you might not need these. Well, hang on. Some of that's pretty good. The jacket is, uh...
This is a matter of national security, Dr Tanner. That privilege doesn't exist in this case. National security, involving Martin? I find that hard to believe. Why do you say that?
Once it is inside the containment tank, we can deactivate it. Ending transmission. Overand out. So let's have that look around. I'm glad you were right, Major. It doesn't explain why your soldiers shot the scientists experimenting on the water.
But they didn't. Colonel Sokalov was under a lot of pressure... ..to prove that the money being spent was going to be worth it. So we don't know that's actually water out there. (creaking) It's alive. What? The water.
Hurry up. I'll buy you a cup of coffee. KIM: Doc? Cops need medics to standby outside a raid.
- That's the jack-off that got away from us. Listen, um I could check my run sheets, maybe get you an address. No, that's okay. The name's enough. He's gotta be in our system. Thanks, Doc. What? Nothing, I guess.
- Don't worry. - I am worried. - I called an insurance guy. - They're referring me to insurance code 4336. You know what that means?
- ... if this keeps happening. - What did we do? Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline testified at Governmental Affairs that the White House couldn't produce the Rockland memo because the White House didn't have the Rockland memo. - Do we? - Holding it in my hand!
- ... that's what Jack Warner called me. - Did you know Jack Warner? Yeah. I used to be a contract player in Hollywood, and I'm 97 years old. Listen... Have you noticed that I am one of the few people here whose nose isn't bent out of shape over Ainsley Hayes? - Yeah. Listen... - I'm serious.
Please don't be mislead by anything.... In fact, let me put it this way... I'm supposed to write about the speech. My paper wants me to see it. If you could move this along.... I thought I'd kiss you, you know, on the mouth and then I'd just get past it.
The calls are going great. I've got a deadline. You can't stand here distracting the female callers. Have I been distracting the female callers? - Even a little? - That's it.
He told me he had you to thank for starting his career in photojournalism because you'd give him a heads up when something's worth shooting. - Leo, what in God's name...? - Look at the photo credit on the picture. You called a photographer. You wanted a picture taken of that. Those kids are commendable. In this day and age, those kids are phenomenal.
- How's it going? We've taken a couple of dozen meetings in the last two days. - Met with Chinese Embassy officials? - Last night. They say... Christians aren't persecuted in China.
- Met with Chinese Embassy officials? - Last night. They say... Christians aren't persecuted in China. Since they're not oppressed, they don't qualify for refugee status. Under U.S. or U.N. conditions, yeah.
What is it? It's the fourth-grader who gets his ass kicked at recess because he sat out the voluntary prayer in homeroom. It's another way of making kids different from other kids. And they're required by law to be there. That's why you want it front and center. The fourth-grader. That's the prize.
Can you believe it? No, neither one of us can believe it, sir. That detention center was being guarded by the California National Guard. Now what does it say about our Reserve Army? That 83 men, women and children who haven't eaten in two months, staged a prison break? Let me read this.
It says homosexuality is an abomination, punishable by death. It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking reflected the best wisdom of its time. But it's just plain wrong by any modern standard. Society has a right to protect itself, but not to be vengeful.
I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack-- Does this shirt come in anything besides cranberry?
I got two old folks in the morgue, mauled beyond recognition. I have no motive to go on, no intent. No evidence cries out for a human explanation, yet you stand there telling me flat out that what we're looking for is a man. Thanks for everything, Agent Scully. We'll take it from here.
I can't exactly explain it, but I realize I owe the detective an apology. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Montana. Headline, circa 1956. The story's the same as what you told me.
- It's worth checking out, don't you think? I don't know. That'd be a neat trick in itself. You never see his face. Ah! But observe. His discarded soda cup.
Beowulf! Xena... The ring. The ring. Xena, don't put it on again. I forged this ring.
What is the twilight? The Fates spoke of a time when mankind would no longer need the gods and they would lose their power. If it's just a myth, Ares, then what are you worried about? Let's just say I believe in being through. I don't like taking chances.
Now, tell me... Which direction are you hitting Pylos from? I've been sent in answer to your prayers. The kingdom of Heaven is beautiful, Eli. The kingdom of Earth is beautiful too, angel. My place has always been among the people.
Yeah, but it's so much pressure. No offense, but what you guys all do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand. Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the wee-ness and I'm not happy. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
Que? It is beautiful. Thine church is almost completeth. There's no way god would want to send us to hell now! Yeah this church kicks a-
For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. - Example. - Example? OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions. - They stink? - Yes, no. - O, they make you cry. - No.
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.
That is horrifying. I've never seen anything like that. It's unbelievable. Worried about the well-being of another driver, another competitor. Goes to show the kind of men they are, their true fabric.
It's unbelievable. Worried about the well-being of another driver, another competitor. Goes to show the kind of men they are, their true fabric. But they worked as a team together. Oh, my God, look at that!
Lift it up, higher. Lift it! Take a breath, Memo. Come on. We're here. We're gonna get you out. -Come on, Memo. -l can't move my leg!
Only the eggs. I can't stand this muck anymore! I need meat! Thank you, Owuor. Fire!
I got this. Let me see it. "Let me see it"? Let me see it, man. Show him the fucking money.
revelation 22: verse 15. -Hey, check it out. -You all right? This looks like a damn graveyard around here, bro. This neighborhood's making a comeback.
How is she, doctor? She's gonna be fine. But this is only temporary. We'll need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her. Aki, can you hear me? I finished it.
Who made him a dope fiend? Go on, girl, go on out. Come in here. Scotty was a junkie when we met him. David likes damaged souls.
Right, what difference does it make? After all, they're just bodies. I mean, after the body's done, just chuck it, hang it from a tree. You playing some kind of game with me, amigo? This stuff could go out of fashion real quick, right?
Phone call. What? Hell no. - I'll get your tape for you. Hey, hey, Captain. You know the guy that owns that little videotape?
She says if you love her, you will win this tournament. There she is, the embodiment of love. Your Venus. And how I hate her. - I don't understand women.
It was the language of Palestinian Christians during the Crusades. Okay, see these lines here and here? They are caves and tunnels beneath the old city. They've remained hidden since the Holy Wars. Professor Finley told me about those.
- That's for sure. But stealing it from a Russian Mafia boss. Come on. Russian Mafia? In fact, he's got some friends... very nasty guys.
I suspect this militant faction will stop at nothing... to suppress the true contents of this final chapter. Though my own safety may be at issue... I have requested an interview with the first disciple... to make these matters known. Your scholar seems to be on the verge... of enlightenment. It wouldn't hurt you to sample some of it yourself.
I'd wager that your dream told you how to become a Master today. No, the Masters and their guild did not inspire my dream. But it taught you the magic spell which will win her? After such a failure, how can I still have hope? I'm always hopeful. And that's been my great advantage. Otherwise, instead of stopping you, I would have run away with you! Don't bear a grudge.
Sachs, my friend, listen to me. That's Lena! Serves him right. I admire you as a cobbler, but even more as an artist. At least let him start!
This way. - What is your name, Father? - Winstead. Lavelle in his room? Yes, he is. It's up the stairs to the left and across the bridge.
Good afternoon, my darlings. Look, I've been meaning to tell you. There's a longstanding rule that wives and girlfriends aren't allowed on the bus. The boys don't like distractions when they're working on their music. You can travel with the wives. They're nice.
Do you really think so? Okay. Are you all alone? Are you heartbroken? Did something happen to the romance?
Why don't ya do somethin', y'know, make yourself useful. All right. I'll be outside -- washing the car. Yeah, you do that. Man, I'm sorry about her. How can I not question our Creator for putting this human obscenity into the presence of such a divine creature.
So why don't you just come home with me? Blow off Denver. No, I'm okay. Listen, I don't want to tell Venna what happened. I don't want to ruin things. Freak her out, you know.
- Can you break this? - I better not These things, they do look better in pieces. They do I can't Stand up
There was no Henry, there was no Martin, there was no grief. There was only David. David had been warned not to explain anything to Monica. Otherwise, she would become frightened, and everything would be spoiled. But David's journey home belonged only to him, so he didn't see the harm of painting her pictures of things... she would have no memory of.
A flesh fair outside Haddonfield - Is he alive? - Yes He's in one piece I see the moon
Maybe she will be special Maybe she will stay I thought this would be hard for you to understand You were created to be so young Maybe the one day will be like that one day inside the amphibicopter
Lieutenant! What the hell is going on out there? What? In semiarid regions on Earth, there are certain organisms... that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains. When the pools dry up, those organisms can't live.
What? In semiarid regions on Earth, there are certain organisms... that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains. When the pools dry up, those organisms can't live. But they don't die either. They go dormant below the surface... away from the hot sun until the next rain cycle begins.
Used to be miners. Then everybody in this place lost their mind. Running around, chopping people's heads off. Ease up, man. We were up on the rim when they called a work stoppage.
Give me those keys. Come on! Is it you? Yes. It's me.
Jericho, can you get us in? I can try. The plan was simple. Sergeant Jericho, the science officer and I jumped off the train... and headed towards the powerplant. The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station.
I can try. The plan was simple. Sergeant Jericho, the science officer and I jumped off the train... and headed towards the powerplant. The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station. The idea was they provide cover... and distract the Martians as we set the charges in the plant.
I mean, how did all of this end up down here? It is said that the gods became jealous of Atlantis. They sent a great cataclysm and banished us here. All I can remember is the sky going dark... and people shouting and running. Then, a bright light, like a star... floating above the city.
-...sending prostitutes to the client. -Prostitutes? -Who sends prostitutes? -Who doesn't? We're about the work.
No one stuck their hands in like I did! No one felt the loneliness more. You had to get out of bed... and wander through the halls. Listen to the throbbing and moaning behind all the doors... and our muffled, homicidal plans. I knew the body of the entire family.
André is ill... he needs care. We better let him rest for a while. Pedro is right. Meanwhile we'll prepare his homecoming party. Blessed be the day of your return.
You set impossible limits! Father, you just said every word is a seed... they contain life, energy... and may even contains an explosive force, we run great risks when we talk. Don't interpret me with suspicion and levity! You know you can count on our love! The love we've learned here... I discovered later, doesn't know what it wants. It's now just a mere hindrance.
This royal office will not grant your petition. It never will. I can't accomplish what I came to do. Proper channels be damned. The royal family had been well aware of this meeting.
Take free will. This problem has been around since Aristotle, in 350 B.C. St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas worried how we can be free if God already knows what we're gonna do. Nowadays, we know the world works by fundamental physical laws. These laws govern the behavior of every object in the world.
Like there's this telepathic thing going on that we're a part of whether we're conscious of it or not. That would explain these seemingly spontaneous, worldwide, innovative leaps in science and art. Like the same results popping up everywhere, independent of each other. A guy on a computer figures something out and simultaneously a bunch of people figure out the same thing. They did this study.
That would explain these seemingly spontaneous, worldwide, innovative leaps in science and art. Like the same results popping up everywhere, independent of each other. A guy on a computer figures something out and simultaneously a bunch of people figure out the same thing. They did this study. They isolated a group over time and they monitored their abilities at crossword puzzles in relation to the general population.
I'm doing a project, maybe you'll be interested. It's a soap opera and the characters are the fantasy lives of the performers in it. So figure out something you've always wanted to do, or a life you want something like that. We write that in then you intersect with others in some typical soap-opera fashion. Then I also want to show it live, with the actors present. So once the episode's screened the audience can direct the actors for subsequent episodes with menus.
Society is a fraud so complete and venal, it demands to be destroyed beyond memory. If there's fire, we'll carry gas. Interrupt everyday experience and the expectations that go with it. Live as if things depend on your actions. Rupture the spell of the consumer society so our repressed desires can come forward.
Live as if things depend on your actions. Rupture the spell of the consumer society so our repressed desires can come forward. Demonstrate what life is and what it could be. To immerse ourselves in the oblivion of actions. There'll be an intensity never known. To exchange love and hate terror and redemption.
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't exist? Or we're all young souls? Half of us are first-round humans? What are you...? - What I'm saying... - What's your point? I believe reincarnation is a poetic expression of what collective memory is. I read an article by a biochemist not long ago.
How does it do it? The intercellular regulatory mechanisms... especially for proliferation and differentiation. - The malignant neoplasia just don't get it. - Neoplasia, cancer cells. Yes, that's right.
The intercellular regulatory mechanisms... especially for proliferation and differentiation. - The malignant neoplasia just don't get it. - Neoplasia, cancer cells. Yes, that's right. You grow normal cells in a tissue culture in a lab... and they replicate enough to form a confluent monolayer... and then divide 20 or 50 times, but eventually they conk out.

- Please, go on. - Perhaps some of these terms are new... - No, you're being very thorough. I make a point of it. I always emphasize it with my students.
Are you going to be sorry when... Do you ever miss people? Everybody asks that, especially girls. What do you tell them? - I tell them, "Yes."
It hangs. It weighs. And yet there is so little of it. It goes so slowly. And yet it is so scarce.
"'and I will swim away from you.' "'lf you become a fish in a trout stream,' said his mother... "'I will become a fisherman, and I will fish for you."' Look at that. A little allegory of the soul.
I have broken the record. I have become something of a celebrity. Kelekian and Jason are simply delighted. I think... they see celebrity status for themselves... upon the appearance of the journal article... they will no doubt write about me. But I flatter myself.
Britain's greatest Christian warrior was dead. King Uther alone would turn back the Saxon hordes and Avalon would be saved by one who believed in the Goddess. Uther took us to his castle at Camelot and made my mother his High Queen. All the unhappiness of the past seemed to be swept away when I saw my little brother, Arthur, for the first time. Help me.
I felt it as a child, but now it's different. Do you feel it? Of course. I am of the same blood as you. Look. The Christians.
"'...and they shall inherit the earth."' Forgive me, my lord, I came without announcement. Mordred of Lothian. I pray only to serve you, sir. I've heard of your deeds, lad. You've routed Saxon troops who outnumbered you 7-to-1 . I have been questioning those Saxons who fall into my hands, my lord.
Forgive me, my lord, I came without announcement. Mordred of Lothian. I pray only to serve you, sir. I've heard of your deeds, lad. You've routed Saxon troops who outnumbered you 7-to-1 . I have been questioning those Saxons who fall into my hands, my lord. And I believe they are planning an invasion.
The tribesmen only follow you because you have the Pendragon banner hanging over their heads. I am the Lady of the Lake. I am the High Priestess of Avalon and I declare she has been deceiving you. This is not Avalon. This is not the will of the Goddess I serve.
That's your new school, Chihiro. Why, it looks very nice. I liked my old school. Mom, my flowers got bent. No wonder, the way you squeeze them.
This look like a piece of crap to you? You like them spinning tires? - You suck! - You do! Did he hurt you, baby?
I got four hours a day to fill, man. It's not often I get a freak plopped into my lap. Go ahead. I'm a roast. Baste me. All right, man. My parents, my sister and I all went to the Grand Canyon.
Hell, I have half a mind to move there myself. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure, honey. Shoot. Your mom and dad still alive? No.
Shoot. Your mom and dad still alive? No. Did they die? One night they got swallowed up by the biggest gator we ever had.
Oh! I wasn't serious at all. I was just joking. That's surprising... You have spoilt my two daughters...
"My trinkets tinkle... they say I am yours," "I can't spend a minute without you, Oh I am yours" "Take me away, oh darling take me away." "Your trinkets tinkle...
"The shimmering bindiya, shines like a star next to the moon," "My anklets call out to you, try to make up to you as you sulk," "Oh my loved, my beloved. Try and understand..." "what I'm trying to say"
"Your beauty shines so brightly, that it shames the moon" "Go away you liar, I'm not taken in" "Don't flatter too much, you're giving yourself away" "I wish from the bottom of my heart, may your pair be forever" "Oh my love, my beloved, wish we spent our lives together forever"
There are no roads. It says... that even the horses cannot go to the end. that will go. I know it. Where let us be us?

' ' They was experts in demolition which did not fear... ' ' nor terrorists, neither sects, nor nobody. ' ' They seemed happy and slackened... ' ' and were in a hurry, each day, to demolish to earn their living. ' ' A the airport, in the tail... ' ' I saw capturing two men who tested... ' ' to leave radioactive material. ' ' As mom said it, ' ' the world is dangerous and dubious.
Which kind of people? You will see. It was upright over there... so close it could feel breath of the monster... he to burn the hairs of the arms. And it spit of the flames on he and its feet took fire. It raised the house out of its foundations... and then, it tore off the door out of its hinges.
-Bathroom? -Me, too. -Take a pass. Oh, thank you. All right, so the British are trying... to reestablish authority over their precious colonies.
But can I do one more thing? What? I want to kiss you one more time. Where are you? Who's the princess on the floor, huh?
- I'm sorry. Every time I think about Dimitri getting that case... - That's my case! - It's not! It's Dimitri's! Deal with it! Listen to this. I went fishing with the super down by the river.
You are a great writer. Let's get this shit down. Scene 29: interior, - warehouse - day. - Dictate this for me, Duke. I want to do the darts going in with a giant close-up. We need the right sound.
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs next to the snow blowers. Alien prisoners released, armed and ready for your orders. Prisoners of MiB, the scum of the universe. Now it's the scum's turn. I'm in a jam, so I'll make this simple.

What did you give him? The answer to that has nothing to do with you. Don't tell me you're angry with me? No.. I'm through with you.
For safekeeping. I thought maybe you could do with it. Blood stays on the blade. That's a sorry looking pelt. And it's been so nice and quiet for the last three months.
We can do better. This dude in my CMA meeting he fucked my sister. He's a quantum physicist. He's telling me about uncertainty. You never know what a molecule is doing.
What can I say? I'm a scary guy. So, Margalo, you case the joint? Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me. They ain't got much.
Look out! Fernand! Good. You finally hit something. Lieutenant Graypool. If your thirst for gore demands the death of these poor fools, then by all means shoot them.
Why else would you be here? If you were truly guilty, there are a hundred prisons in France where they would lock you away, but Chateau d'If is where they put the ones they're ashamed of. Let's have a look at your quarters now, shall we? "God will give me justice." People are always trying to motivate themselves.
Got a really good deal. Za-Zatarra? Zatarra, the boat cannot hold no more, and there are at least eight more boatloads down there! Do you not understand? You are wealthier than any man I have ever heard of.
But why risk your life rescuing me? The son of a fellow noble. It was the least I could do. Judging by your character, I'm sure you would have done the same. Your father will be proud of you.
You just remind me of someone from long ago, someone who was very dear to me. What happened to him? He died. But I'm not that man. Monsieur and Madame Villefort.
What was that? - Are you new here? Yes, we've just been transferred. I understand. This potion is a magic potion. Made by our druid.
What the hell are you two trying to do? Get yourselves killed? What seems to be the trouble, Officer? I'm here to bring you in, young lady. What'd she do this time?
I couldn't put their security at risk " Helen, that's my wife" she wouldn't vote out What about my family you might ask What about my wife and daughter

Dad's rich. Mom's just mad. Tap it. I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this. It's not that I didn't try.
Could the little one please stop that? Kid, no elevator! And we emerge in the master suite. That's strange. What?
Nobody lived. The Yanomami are still wearing some of their clothing. That's Juanajuapa up ahead. Some of the bodies washed out of the bus... down the river and right into the village. The guides we are meeting... they work with all the tribes in the area.
He was a liar. You'd never lie to me, right? No, I neverwould. What am I gonna do about Dick? We are going to act as ifnothing's wrong.
Excuse me. I have to go talk to a wayward relative, okay? What areyou doing? Get rid ofthat thing. No, listen. I'm beginning to grow attached to it.
Mr. Kaufman, does your client understand? She does, Your Honor. Your Honor, I'm not here to debate everyone's opinion about Simon Dunne's intention. I'm here to present some papers to the court which are signed by Mr. Dunne. They've all been notarized.
- One second. - You wanna come to my office? - No. No. - Why not? - You got your car?
There's a meeting at 6:00. God grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot change. It's an admirable gesture, but it's unnecessary. I can't leave this. I can't... It's unnecessary, because you've already filed the power of appointment with the court. A bonded courier delivered it to the judge just before 5:00, and our bailiff signed for it.
I should never have left the scene of an accident. I should know better. My file, did you find it? I had an orange file. It was in my briefcase.
Pumpkin will never understand what you've done to him! I'm gonna call your sorority the Dean and the President of the University! And your parents! You will never see Pumpkin again! You poor, poor dear.
And you know why I like plants? Because they're so mutable. Adaptation's a profound process. It means you figure out how to thrive in the world. Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
Because they're so mutable. Adaptation's a profound process. It means you figure out how to thrive in the world. Yeah, but it's easier for plants. I mean they have no memory.
And it's before sex, because, like, everything was asexual. From there we go to bigger things. Jellyfish. Then that fish that got legs and crawled out on the land. And then we see, you know, like, dinosaurs.
Nobody can judge you if you almost died. Well, I judged her. Maybe I was being judged too. It was like a month after that, Hurricane Andrew came along and just swooped down like an angel of God and just wiped out everything I had left. Everything.
No shit, I'm a fun character. Who's gonna play me? Well, I've gotta write the book first, John. Then, you know, they get somebody to write the screenplay. Hey, I think I should play me.
I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these plants. But it isn't part of my constitution. I suppose I do have one unembarrassed passion. I wanna know what it feels like to care about something passionately. "Should one be lucky enough to see a ghost orchid all else will seem eclipsed. "
-You sound like my father. Look at them, Philby. All alike. Identical bowler hats. You want your students to be like that? I want my students prepared for the realities of the world.
We spent years together. Just talking. The conversation's a little spotty now, but I do remember. It's good to have a friend. Then you can help us find the Morlocks, find Mara.
You're not taking me anywhere! I'm not going out! Look at me! Do you know what you're doing to Kathy? What you're doing to the girls.
Stop! No, not like this. No, stop! We bring them in looking like this, civil liberty lawyers'll crucify us. We put them under duress, this bust gets bounced at arraignment.
Where you going? Lena. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I left you at the hospital. I called a phone-sex line--
I believe this is a small piano. It's not a piano. I got a piano at home. Where did you get it? It was dropped in the street.
Fine. How's Mr. Grey? He's fine. Well... Peter called.
Some people have to wash something... as soon as they've worn it for like half a day. Yes. - And then you got... your more laid-back folk, who will wash this stuff when it's dirty. Which kind are you? I'm the type of guy... who wants to get married and have a kid.
That's my puppy. Really? Thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience, but I cannot ignore you being jobless. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly.
Come on. You're-- You're scaring me. I mean, I- - Hal means to preview this in two weeks... to get some audience reaction and-- The audience will... rush into the projection booth... and grab the print and hurl it into the sea. Here are the rest of the cards the audience filled out.
- [Doorbell Rings] - Blindness as metaphor. That's great. Guess what? - Guess what? What? - The movie. Your movie.
- I'm not one of those directors. - Val? When the picture's over, then I cut the whole thing together- - Yes? - You seem distracted. - [ Coughing ] Distracted?
You know, I think this could make... a kind of tough, gritty, New York, big city movie. You can't make any money just in big cities. Well, I mean, where do you think this is going to play? It's not going to appeal to farmers or shopping malls in Biloxi. Oh, I completely disagree.
We both hated it. You hated traveling every place by car all the time. And I hated traveling by mud slide. Well, what did you want me to do? Our marriage wasn't going anyplace.
Good night. Happy Halloween. Oh, I'm not a pagan, but thanks all the same. Which ankle did you twist, Holden? My left.
A man like me doesn't have any business in politics. They say you should always do what you know. And what I know is good fried chicken. Yes, ma'am. Don't you think your supporters in the African-American community... will be particularly disappointed?
Man, you really need to relax. Go see a movie. - A movie? A movie. Come on, man!
- Move it. Be careful. - Let's go. Why? So you can tell me what a sellout I am again?
You're the Grim Reaper! I don't want to go to hell! I ain't never did nothing but good! I swear to God I ain't done nothing wrong! Oh, come on.
Well, I checked the ship's records to see what happened to her crew. Nothing. The records must have been wiped by whatever happened. They suffocated. The ship was holed beyond their capacity to repair it.
According to the hieroglyphs this city was built by an ancient race that drove off the forces of darkness a billion years ago. They indicate that the enemy was driven from normal space into a place of eternal darkness. - A parallel dimension? - It's possible. The translators were still working on the rest of it.
Back on Earth there were two train robbers in the North American West Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. They came up with a great idea. Rob a train, wait two days then rob the same train all over again in exactly the same way. Because nobody ever figured they'd pull the same gag twice in a row. Since we had nothing left to pull, I thought we'd try the same thing.
To all of you, welcome aboard. You may proceed with the naming of names. This star reminds us that we are born of the stars. We live in starlight, we die in starlight. We come from the stars in life, and we return to the stars in death.
You've got time to get to the escape pods. The least we could do is buy you some time to get away. Full burn. We live for The One we die for The One. Navigation set course to intercept those pods and grapple them aboard.
You mean, my tits are bothering you. Oh, come on. This machine is bothering me... because it's not functioning. I think you're, like, ticked off... because you had the big knockers... back in the day. - No, yeah. It's true. Come on, babe. And you know what?
That's the idea, isn't it? What idea? Well, I mean, if you put yourself together... the way that you've put yourself together... that's... obviously, you're trying... to get attention. I don't look any different. Oh, please. You used to be much smaller-chested. You mean, my tits are bothering you.
The Jewish community gave to him and now, they are stopped! Must one think that your government does not respect its word? Alas... I wait until you say to me: "Why you do not resign?"
- I do not evaluate. I want enormous stocks of Zyklon in only one place, underground. Spend an even little money. The suppliers will have evil to follow. They shout Heil Hitler and fill the pockets.
By here. Wait there, an authorization is needed. It is out of question... that a S.S... who betrays his country enter here. Certain treasons are the last weapon of right. We all love you.
It is in Wehrmacht? One has it to them piqué thanks to his/her father who is a friend. THE FÜHRER ORDERS, WE OBEY Father! I return from Vienna, I had your message.
More? On what? If what you say is true, the Holy Father must be informed. But it will ask me evidence. The Pope is unaware of what do we make the Jews?
If what you say is true, the Holy Father must be informed. But it will ask me evidence. The Pope is unaware of what do we make the Jews? With its priests, its parishes, its bishops, it has the best service of information in the world. It is informed persecutions of catholics.
The Holy Father must remain neutral in order to act for peace. And there will not act to remain neutral. It could intervene in the name of Christ... Germans would occupy the Vatican then and would plunder it. The Vatican should be saved or Christianity?
Good day, inspector. -You know the penalty for a handgun? -l told you, it's not my gun. -Then we'll just keep it. Now, about your motorcycle. You really want to report it stolen?
RAMU: But /'m a fake. [Tender instrumental music] I have betrayed you all and... I am sorry, I.... -All your wisdom.... -lt was just an act. But, I gave up all my stuff. I am sorry. I'm a fake. What does that make me?
Om. LARS: Lex? One more "Om" and then you have to come to your party. It always has to be what she wants, even on my birthday. I wanted a Tibetan gathering with a Rinpoche... but no, she does an Indian feast with a.... ...world-famous swami. SWAMl BU: All those people care about is sex and money.
Well, it's a big country. lexi: Gurus shun the life of wealth and materialism. Swami Muktananda said everything in the universe... is made of divine consciousness... and its innermost form dwells in the centre of us all. Wow, that's good. Lexi, can I see you in the kitchen?
Come on. What would he crap? It's not like he'd eat. Well, he eats souls. So, I assume that he would crap soul residue. By that, I would mean that if you die from his mouth, you don't go to the other side where the souls go.
I was goin' down for the last count And I knew it But I still have my soul. It's still mine. All mine.
And I knew it But I still have my soul. It's still mine. All mine. And the folks up there at Shady Rest... they have theirs, too.
They don't want us to know how the old world was. But I know. I've read the books. People lived in huge cities that stretched up to the sky. They had heat and cool air when they wanted.
My God, the power! I feel like I could tear this place apart. Heather's dead! She went through the same thing as you except her body twisted inside out. We'll take the human species to a new level. Normal people can't survive.
What do you need expensive clothes for? - Melrose Place call you to be a star? - Someone gave them to me. Even better. All profit. That's why I love this country.
Rachael. Why-- why haven't you gone home? I will just hang around here during the break. Why? Don't you have family waiting at home for you?
-It's silver, you old lump. Stainless steel. Silver has... that distinguished look about it. Anyway, as I was saying before, I said to Leora she ought to have it looked at immediately. So what does she do? She waits an entire month.
She's really honest. You know? She's a really... She's really open. And I feel bad. And I'm not helping. Exactly. I'm just getting myself in deeper and deeper.
Man, it curled. Danger. Proceed with extreme caution. Shit! How are the, uh girls? They're getting dressed.
When do you think he's gonna get the hint? I dunno. The break through his windshield wasn't enough of a hint? Cool. Looks like he's over you. Asshole. Hey, Ben, did you order some transvestites?
I don't know, he's just really pissed. There you are, you piece of shit. You wanna tell me why anybody in their right mind would need to listen to music this fucking loud? - What? - I took a big gamble letting' you talk me into this after-hours bullshit, McGewen. I'm not licensed for this.
The Untladhavns. Yeah, no kidding. And when they sent in this cultural anthropologist he discovered that these people never lied. They didn't even have a word for it. That's great for them.
Now get 'em outta here. Wanna hear something great? That was Gregory's laundered money we took from the safe kept there under an alias. The fucker got arrested for stealing from himself. Couldn't do anything about it.
How did you get that? ! Well, it's all prototype, Juni. You can't be running around with those mass-produced gadgets. Just means everyone's got them. I always go with the prototype.
[ Snaps fingers ] The Transmooker device. How did you know? Your cloaking device is highly coveted. People everywhere are trying to get their hands on it. Are you sure we're the only humans here?
What a bizarre man. - - Gerti: Help us! Help! Somebody! What are you guys doing down there? ! That's real funny, clown.
You look great, Carmen. - - You want to dance? - - Sure. I don't think that's a good idea, Gary. Family rules say you need to ask my father's permission. You know, you should have had that suit tailored, Juni.
You've thought of that before. I had considered it. - What about the women? - Dead? Mere puppets.
Sorry. Force of habit. That beautiful tiger, this house, this musica, I don't think anybody knows you at all, D. Everybody wonders about you, though. Especially the women.
That beautiful tiger, this house, this musica, I don't think anybody knows you at all, D. Everybody wonders about you, though. Especially the women. What do they want to know? They find you very mysterious and interesting.
If that painting meant so much to him, Why destroy it? And why didn't he kill those two women at the museum? They both got a good look at him. Maybe he's trying to stop. Mr. Crawford, all you've got is a hunch.
Wait! Rankin and Willingham, when they tossed his cell took Polaroids so they could put everything back in place. Ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves! - Where? - The Library!
Not your standard gumshoe, is he? More alert. Purposeful looking. You should have taught him not to meddle. Forgive the stationery.
DIRECTOR: Here we go. And... action. As the pnoject moved fonwand. The issue of how to tneat populan alien mythology had to be addnessed. Fnom the numouned cnash at Roswell to cnop cincles to the countless neponts fnom those who claim to have been abducted. Steven wanted to stay true to the UFO mythology and to the lore and everything from the scoop marks to the way the greys looked, the way the shapes look.
Fnom the numouned cnash at Roswell to cnop cincles to the countless neponts fnom those who claim to have been abducted. Steven wanted to stay true to the UFO mythology and to the lore and everything from the scoop marks to the way the greys looked, the way the shapes look. If you speak to a hundred people who claim they have been abducted, they basically give the same story, and he felt it was important not to change the lore, but to stay with it and come up with new revelations upon it. You're talking about the tumours. They are not tumours.
What's great is that it takes the story over three generations with the Keys family, Clarke family, and the Crawford family and their interaction with aliens from another planet. The Keys, of course, they fight back. If they come for me again, I'm not going without a fight, and if that lands me in some hospital room screaming, then that's what it does. BOHEM: The Clarke family... a family whose lives have also been touched by the aliens, but in a very different way. I've met them, too.
And here's the final composite, the final shot. When it came to integnating the visual effects. One of the biggest issues facing Lima didn't involve digital technology. Ht involved neal actons. It is very challenging when you do a show that has a fair amount of visual effects. There's a lot of acting that you do without the actual ship there or the actual alien there.
that we could relate to. The ships... we wanted to stay close to the lore. We weren't gonna come up with a ship that looked different than what people had reported seeing in the sky. But he created details in them that really made them unique and special and sort of took them to the next level. But penhaps the gneatest laboun of love fon the effects team was giving binth to the aliens. Othenwise known as "gneys." Evenyone knew you can't tell a gneat stony about alien abduction without gneat aliens.
Combining human dnama with special effects and offens a secnet histony of the 20th centuny. As viewens will soon find out. Taken not only bneathes new life into the minisenies fonmat. But challenges the imagination. What I hope that people come away with from Taken is a sense that we're all asking the same questions. That while, clearly, these beings are far, far more technically advanced than we are, they're not God, either. They're still asking the same questions.
It's a fundamental question that everybody asks themselves, "Is there, in fact, life in the universe?" Steven Spielbeng has always been fascinated by the possibility of alien life. But this gneat Hollywood stonytellen was neady to explone the topic even funthen in the ultimate tale of alien abduction. That super-secret spy balloon of yours...
Have we been visited by extnatennestnials? Does the militany know something they'ne not telling us? What did happen in 1947 with our government? Why was there so many sightings back in 1947? I think it's an interesting question, and it's fun to let your mind go there, to explore what might be out there in space.
Pods now opening. What are you doing? ! She's ruining everything. Electrical malfunction. Hatchery door is disengaged. Ah, I knew girls like you in high school. Yeah?
But I think the guy who runs the thing... is just not very smart. I mean, you know, this is between us... but I just don 't think he's very smart. I think his instincts are all wrong... and I think he's, you know, the big butt. Yeah, you know, I've lost my temper in traffic. I have. I've lost my temper.
What do you think is exhibitionism? Porn. What--well, no, OK. That's a good question. I think it goes way beyond just wanting to perform. You can't pretend that you're having sex with someone... when you are actually having sex with them. Well, I think Well, I think that they're enjoying themselves,
Get down from there. Just meet me in the lobby, please. You'll have a great time. I know you'll love Gus. I can't go to a party like that, I have nothing to wear, Wear the green dress. You look great in it.
-Oh, my God! Of course he's cold! I don't know ifyou can calculate... I don't know if you can quantify... the effect that would have on a ten-year-old girl. I think Lee is like... Have you ever seen a dog get hit by a car... but walk away?
How's Mum? She will survive, say the doctors. How's the old man? Not so well. There are many Italian restaurants in Duisburg.
Next time it's more than one night. Next time they won't let you leave again! That's where you belong! Are you okay? - What is this? - It was my camera.
Didn't I tell you to clear off? Will you get the hell out of here? Do you know how my father died? What did those witches tell you? Nothing, I swear.
Shit, grandma, don't do that! Your grandpa and your dad made westerns. Come off it! "I'll Go, Kill Him and Come Back." "Two Bullets For Charlie."
Do I have to pay? If you want to go in, you sure do. When does the show start? -It depends. -On what?
When does the show start? -It depends. -On what? If there are people, they do the show. If not, why bother? In any case, I have to be here.
-On what? If there are people, they do the show. If not, why bother? In any case, I have to be here. Whether they do it or not, I have to be here. Just in case.
Don't speak to them yet. Give me three hours. We filmed "Flint's Gold" here in 1 965. This set was built over what was once a real mine, from when they believed there was gold in Almeria. And now, we've come to the creme de la creme. The museum of the west!
It's as if he could speak! Luckily he hasn't said anything! She's leaving for Europe and she didn't even kiss me! Vita, are you jealous? There's no place for dreams and jealousy here.
You, ask Vita where to put the statue. I don't give a damn now! Today, there are no clouds in the sky! He said that it's shit and nothing works! Nothing to expect from men here!
"Cathleen Whitaker proves that it does. "A woman as devoted to her family... as she is kind to Negroes." To Negroes? Let me see that. What on Earth is that woman thinking? Oh, she's been liberal ever since she played summer stock at college... with all those steamy Jewish boys.
I know. That's, uh, partly why I'm calling really. I got a call from Dick yesterday... and he said that everything was set, um, papers drawn up. And he wanted to know how Thursday was for you. 3:00 or sometime? I--I told him I thought you had car pool Thursdays, but I wasn't absolutely certain, so I said I would check.
Let me see that. What on Earth is that woman thinking? Oh, she's been liberal ever since she played summer stock at college... with all those steamy Jewish boys. Why do you think they used to call her "Red"? Oh, for heaven sakes. Let's go inside before Joe McCarthy comes driving by. - Uh-oh. - Oh, I love that scarf.
But she's anywhere, I mean, she... she has no bounds and you need your privacy. She's not in my way. I'm working in private, - it's not a problem. - What about the noise? They're very respectful when the door is closed.
So we were saying our last goodbyes at the hotel, and he said, "Richard-san, please, do me this special favor." He said, "Would you please buy two roses, one rose for me and one for you, "and would you please go out to the Arizona and play taps for me?" And I've been doing that every month since 1991, and he keeps replenishing me with money. It is my way of expressing my apologies to the people who lost their lives as a result of our sneak attack. That is why I bow my head and pray, and dedicate a rose.

Just right down there, within 20 to 30 yards of the beach. Of the water's edge. I wanted to see the beach, and the beaches haven't changed. For over 50 years, I've had nightmares that I just can't describe. I'm hoping to put these ghosts to rest.
Everywhere you looked, somebody was dying. [Merrill] Wanted to cross the beach quickly, because it was being raked with 88's, machine guns, and there was a lot of sniper fire as well. You only got one way to deal with it. Look for a place to get out, get cover by jumping into a hole or digging one. And that's hard, because that sand flows back in as soon as you shovel it. At this time, a young Marine, I'd estimate about 17 years old, he was running by and a sniper shot him in the head, right above his left eye.
He's helping you already. Granddad, please don't leave me here. I don't want to stay here with the Sisters. I hate them! They're the Brides of Christ.
You may step down. The great day has finally arrived. The day Desmond Doyle and his kids, and indeed the whole of Ireland... has been waiting for. The day when Desmond finds out, once and for all... whether he will get his kids back. Sister, why couldn't me and the boys go to court today?
Pay attention. Checking of the watch is good. Or of the pager. Or looking for a street sign like you're lost. You saw me do a combination. Whatever it is, don't get caught. Do you think women have a clue what goes on up here?
I sit here and think of ways to make people feel bad. - I thought you wrote for commercials. - I do... but you can't sell a product without fiirst making people feel bad. Why not? Because it's a substitution game.
You saved my life. Now I'm gonna save yours. A packet of Wall Street, please. 27, please. I'll just have the potato chips and cigarettes.
No-neck pigs. Ohh! Help me make the bed, Lena. Football players are so nasty. I don't even know where to start.
I just don't want to lose you. Can I ask you a really weird question? Yeah. Are you wearing my cologne? Yes. Uh-huh.
- She was perfectly positioned. If she had the balls to charge... Why does the sun rise in the east? What? Why does the sun rise in the east?
It will be very useful to you. Actually, this was my father's wish. Goodbye. When she left, she made me think of a line spoken by a killer: "A gun is like a bird.
Actually, this was my father's wish. Goodbye. When she left, she made me think of a line spoken by a killer: "A gun is like a bird. If you don't grab it tightly enough, it flies away.
Yeah... What can I say? I made a huge mistake. At school? The problem is identification, or overidentification. It hurts when you grow fond of them, get too attached to them.
It was obvious, Pedro. I saw it coming. You know why? You were too nice to her. Women hate that.
-What? I can bring it with donuts or with cookies. I prefer donuts. Why? Well, because...
The morning sun shines on my face. Woken by a cool breeze. Hey... The city's my friend. Today's my day, nobody gets in my way. The girls on the corner are giggling.
I fuck like a champ. I have a girlfriend but I screw around, which is what keeps us happy and together. Like in Cuba. Cubans are living on food rations, practically starving to death, but they're happy. Why?

I know this sounds silly. But, did my parents ever have another daughter? Another daughter? -Where did you get that idea? -I know it seems absurd, but... Your parents and I have been friends for as long as I can remember.
We'll be gone in a minute. Be careful with those. They cost a fortune. I'm warning you. I thought you didn't know how to use the TV.
I'd given Stanley his first big gig back in 1967 on Goodbye, Columbus. "Called to tell you one thing. From this day on, the life of Robert Evans is going to be a better one. You're way overdue, kid. Now sleep well".
What do I do? May? May, would you help this gentleman? You got to help me here, May. I got a serious situation here, okay?
That's why we came here in the first place. I'm telling you, this is a major party town. - Really? - Are you kidding me? You know what it's like when you go to a new town and you're the new guy?
This is that town. It's like when I go party up at Wambusau. My cousin goes to school there. When I party at Wambusau, I know I'm gonna get pussy. Plus the girls there don't know I'm a deputy.
It's like when I go party up at Wambusau. My cousin goes to school there. When I party at Wambusau, I know I'm gonna get pussy. Plus the girls there don't know I'm a deputy. So I know they're gonna party hard with me.
What's that supposed to mean? - I've got a better story. - Paul: I'm sorry, but no story is better than Karen and the shower massage. No, seriously. One time I was masturbating... and my dog came up and started licking my balls.
Well, hardly, Mr. Abernathy. That would require tissue that would've been consumed during the meal. In my experience, bone fragments from a cremation are usually much smaller. Fortunately for us, the crematorium did a completely inept job. there might be some charred tissue for me.
They're having a rough patch like any couple. It'll work out. I hope so. The only bar in town is hostile now. Their package delivery is a disaster.
If there are more problems like this, kiss your job goodbye. OK. Understood. Goodbye. Is this phone possessed?
They're partners. All right, but when you're out on the street, the only person that can watch your back is your partner. And your life is in their hands. So I don't know about you, but that makes me feel like it's a family. But the law... doesn't see it that way.
And then there's the name-calling. She nicknamed me... "Slutface" and insisted that the other girls call me that. They also attacked me on social media, calling me a ho... stuff like that. And no one stands up for you.
You are the same person as before, and you know exactly how to get Grayson going, not to mention the guy is totally crazy about you. And that is what makes for good sex. Thank you. How's your cheerleader case going? God, it's a mess.
So he wishes... actually... he prays for that attention back and... a month later, he's diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia. And the... cancer eats away at the boy until there is almost nothing left. But he fights it. He survives and... now he has a choice to make. Does he decide that he was punished or that he was rewarded?

We'll get you to a hospital. But right now you need to drop the weapon. No. He took 20 years of my life from me. You got that backwards.
Well, I suspect that yielded a plethora of hits. I'll be retired before I get through them all. I was hoping maybe you could help me narrow my search. We only have two data points. Well, do the best you can.

The circuit breakers melted in the off position. I find it very hard to believe that this guy was just sitting in the dark waiting to explode. No one cuts the power to their own home. If this was the man who you were supposed to meet, someone wanted to make sure that he wouldn't talk. ♪ Bones 9x24 ♪ The Recluse in the Recliner Original Air Date on May 19, 2014
Stand by me, comrade in arms. Why should we Americans bend the knee to the king of a small island on the other side of the world? Bold men in England are rising up against the new tyrant.... James Stuart. We must seize the moment.
MASCA: You must lead his people. Remember your promise. BETH: I promise. I want to name him for his father, Masca - strong one. Hello.
It's about the state's attorney race and Finn Polmar. Well, I figured as much. Are you referring to the attorney general's report? Apparently the worst-kept secret in Illinois. I did approve the charges.
Am I Jewish? Yeah. Why? I need you to sit second chair. On what? Do you care?
Let's go. Anger Management 2x55 - Charlie and Jordan Go to Prison - Original air date April 3, 2014 Will you please get up and help me clean this place? The publisher is gonna be here any minute.
Well, I've never seen a case before, but his symptoms fit all the criteria. The disease was pretty widespread among the Fore. But he was in New Guinea almost 20 years ago. It can take decades to incubate. I'll tell you what, if it is Kuru, he doesn't have long.
Where are you going? You can't really run away from this. Okay, what... what are you doing now? - I'm looking for tampons. - Why?
You can't really run away from this. Okay, what... what are you doing now? - I'm looking for tampons. - Why? Because women don't need tampons when they're pregnant.
Um, the first time I saw it, I wanted to run out of the building. I know you weren't trying to hurt anyone when you shot at the machine. You were just trying to stop the voices. How do you know about the voices? 'Cause sometimes I hear voices, too.
Wilt Chamberlain's Jersey number. Yeah, th-this symbol was found at a crime scene today. - It means something. - Okay. Um, well, the diamond is used in a lot of different cultures.

Okay. Drink a lot of water. Water. Uh, Ragosa's on ecstasy? No, how... I... wait.
But I don't want to make any assumptions. What'd you find? A significant concentration of mountain spleen wort pollen. Excuse me? A little fern.
What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Where's the money? I don't know. That money didn't just disappear!
It's just a matter of choosing the right one. Right, we'll get those sent off for you right away, thank you very much. Bye now. Bye. DOOR CLOSES CAMILLA: He was a married man, apparently, not that Lady Katherine Longmore let that stop her.
No one took him seriously. Until he was killed. The case is now in the hands of the NYPD. Look, I'd like you to take a peak into the investigation. See if anything jumps out.
- Do you understand? - Right. I couldn't tell you. So you said. I... I need to know.
An hour ago, you didn't know these people existed. Now you can't continue until you determine the parentage of their child. I can't explain it, Oliver. I just... have got an instinct. An instinct.
In second grade, on Bring Your Father to School Day, I brought a picture of Harrison Ford! Everybody loved me. And I was a liar. ...and then in high school, Mom was the only one there to teach me how to shave. I was 20 before I realized I didn't have to do my armpits!

You know, have the decency to kill yourself in you own bathtub. Grab a handful of pills, a fifth of Stoli, you throw in a little Captain Beefheart, and you enjoy the ride. Do you even care that he's dead? Oh, my God no. He had a wife and two daughters.
What did she say, exactly? I know you're there. From the second I laid eyes on you, I knew something was wrong. And now this is where it all ends. Fitting. I don't think we've come to the end just yet, Victoria. Well, I'm certain the authorities will disagree
Please! They destroyed David. And you destroyed his daughter. I'm sorry. Sorry's not enough.
Because they're afraid of computers? Yes. This machine is frightening to people, but it's made by people. And people aren't frightening? It's not that. It's more of a cosmic disturbance.
That is definitely the argument I'd use. 77 cents on the dollar isn't a job-to-job figure. It's a specious statistic. Women leave the workforce at different times. They also don't negotiate as hard.

We don't have any idea where she is, or... you're seeing this, right? Yeah. Good, just checking. Get your stuff. Just relax, Miss Channing.
Do you want to tell me what happened to your father? A bad man killed him. I think you're ignorant. I think the bloodlust is in you. Whoever killed him will someday be punished.
I'm not going to hurt you! It's all right! You're safe now. My name is Sebastian and I want to help you. What's your name?
Wait a second. You're a genius. I'm calling housekeeping. Fresh towels? Yeah, okay. Jay interviewed the housekeeper at the hotel.
You are going to ruin my business. Every dark cloud has a silver lining. Our famous vanishing patient. Or is it... patients? They left the hospital for the same reason anyone does:
I don't want to buy love! I wish you could be inside my body for one minute to know what it feels like to be me! It's like when I had tuberculosis, and you took me out to the Utah desert, and there was nothing but dry open space for hundreds of miles around us. That is what is inside of me. Those girls were a cool stream of glacier water.
So, tell me, how does a tall, handsome Internet mogul with great hair get his start? Oh, the way we all do. You get shoved into a locker by a football player. Oh! Dinner was superb.
It wasn't just a trap. It was gonna be a choice. You join us or feed us. You know... bears... when they start to starve, they eat their young. If the bear dies, the cub dies anyway.
Am I watching you enough now? Huh, am I? Am I? ! Dude, say yes! I got to be honest. That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling.
His exact words were, "You were right. I killed that dumb bitch." So you might want to get in front of this thing, Captain Salter. 'Cause when we nail him, he's gonna throw your ass under the bus. I'll give you one question.
We're here to listen. I know we've talked a lot about a merger. I have my own dissenting voices at Lockhart/Gardner. Many don't want to let you back in the door. - Great. - Cary.
- Yeah. - You have your keys? - Yeah. You know, I speak in public all the time. Some people think I speak too much.
- Dad! Mr. Carbone, we spoke earlier. Just wait. These pictures could cause a lot of problems, right? I don't think he should give them away for nothing.
I have the schedules and addresses of each judge. We'll get on that. Great. Christine is leading drug litigation. Pentobarbital is the norm. But since European companies stopped exporting it, prisons are using local pharmaceutical companies.
No more time. Not one day. I'm worried that it will be a deal-breaker. This is not a game, Daniel! The body has its own wisdom.
What? Didn't have it in him. I know you've always considered him the genius behind Godfrey Industries, because that's the company line, and I didn't want to spoil your fantasy. But JR's only genius was recognizing it in others. He met a brilliant medical student one summer in Greenwich Village in a bathhouse, and an even more brilliant woman on the stage in London.
What does that mean? You need water. Come. The universe is dead. Death does not concern us, as long as we live, the death is not here.
Hey. Thanks for holding my seat. The Brotherhood, Hank. It wears many faces. You have not even served half of your sentence. How can you be out on parole?

We can be discreet. Can you think of anything else? Did Joey behave strangely? Anything unusual? His car alarm kept going off.
You tell them. It will mean more coming from you, neena. You're never going back in there. You should not make promises you cannot keep. My freedom is temporary.
And a standing bear will never run, no matter what. Thank you, miss stillwater. Did you find out who did it? Not yet. First I... I thought Ben's murder might involve one of his patients.
Sharper than a Mongolian's arrow. Should I be afraid? Only if you insult me. Then... I must watch my words. And the women you have conquered.
He bore the mark of Cain... and was cursed to roam the Earth. Endlessly. To this day? No. He wandered until he could wander no more.
Maidar's boy. Taban. Taban. How many times had I told Maidar... he was not prepared for war. Like you, as a boy, his head was always in numbers.
You get involved with them, you damage us. You damage the family business. I thought he would never go. One day, he will understand. Your chest is puffed.

Let me tell you though, brother, this had better not be some soldier for the new world order using Oz Turner's broadcast to disseminate encrypted information. - Just saying. - Yeah. That's him. Here we go. Very nice double-transposition encryption you devised.

Hey, man. Hey! Some other dude is kissing your girl right now. _ Women! Am I right? !
'Cause it doesn't make sense that men are in charge. It makes sense that women would be in charge. Because your mom is the first person who takes care of you. So how-- you'd have-- it would just make sense that mothers would run the world, and, uh, they don't-- it's the opposite. So we have this weird system of, uh, you know, men being-- It's kind of upside down.

I'm a professional in the field of romance and relationships. And it pains me to admit it, but in my professional opinion, you and Lisbon will not last as a couple. Because you're drawn to each other for the wrong reasons. You're attracted to her virtue, her honesty, and her goodness -- things you think you lack. She's interested in you for your danger, your unpredictability, your transgressions.
It's here, isn't it? - What? That thing you wouldn't tell me about -- the other reason you did this. I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. The 1.5 million euro Nemec received for those passport chips.
Right. Are you following me? Charlie, it's the closest place to work. What do you want, Nick? I want to talk to you about that photo you got.
All the places we picked up "Ar Rissalah" in the chatter. Is this accurate? Not only is it accurate, but it's live. Notate and disseminate to the rest of the staff as soon as possible. If that scale is right, it's massive.
You were the one pushing for that trip to Kabul, weren't you? Yes. I was. Constance Payton's a decorated veteran, and I wanted to remind the voting public that unlike four of the last five presidents, she actually fought for this country. Well, that political maneuver almost cost her her life.
[ scoffs ] [ chuckling ] what, do you think I... Offed him? What choice did you have? Once it became a murder investigation, His attorney would have poked so many holes in our case That the charges would have been dropped long before trial. But if he were to kill himself... And that's where the real genius lies.
I wasn't aware we're at the penny ante table. I'll slow down so you can catch your breath and count your chips. If you'd like to compare bank balances, I could have that arranged. But in the meantime, why don't you show a little class... if you have any. Are... Do you have a plan, or are you just trying to get attention here?
Another loser? Give me some room. And by the way, cologne is not a substitute for daily bathing. Maybe you loaded the disk incorrectly. It's not like loading a dishwasher.
I just want to let you know... - I get it. - You do? Going out in public together... it's a big step. These legs... they're long enough to take it.
I'll come with you. Yeah, me too. I replace my spark plugs. - I rebuilt my transmission. - Yeah? I rebuilt my engine.
Why do you want to kill it? 'It's a little baby.' Doctor, how do we kill it? Kill the moon? Kill the moon.
Do you want to share it with the class? Well, I had a little hypothesis. The seismic activity, the surface breaking up, the variable mass, the increase in gravity, the fluid... I scanned what's down there. The moon isn't breaking apart.
You mind if I go first? Yeah, sure, sure. I don't know how to say this. I lost your necklace. I had it yesterday and when I went to shower this morning I realized it was gone.

If I don't, he'll kill you. That's enough talking. That thing needs to go, now. Look at it. It doesn't want me to.

No. That's just who Lorelei was. She made you feel like you were living life on edge, that things would fly apart any second. But it was worth it. She made you feel like you were truly alive.
When did you become such a cynic? Oh. I don't know. I used to love Christmas, too. It was the only day that my parents didn't fight. They were at each other all the time.
Huh? Doesn't he look hot, Laura? I think it's what's inside that really counts. - Thought you liked the sweater. - We'll talk later. I'm off. I may need to borrow a car.
I won't force you to prostitute I can't believe she just said that! I said, shut up That mouthy bitch The Police announced an emergency warning today and are still investigating the casings left on the site

They have admirers from all over I hope they don't get caught Never! Even the tough marine pissed his pants Copycat crimes have begun occurring all over the country
Maybe her aunt is illegal alien. You know, these Mexicans... Hey, hey, she's Puerto Rican. That makes her a citizen of the United States. That's more than I can say for you.
Taxi! Overfed faces getting pulled and lifted and stretched all taut and shiny. You're not fooling anybody, sweetheart. Taxi! Fuck the Uptown brothers.
Going gray does bother you. - No, it doesn't. - Of course it does. If it didn't bother you, you wouldn't smear that goop all over your scalp 10 billion times a day. Hey, it's a non-issue, Jake. Well, are table manners an issue? See that silver thing to the left of your plate?
I'm here with friends, so I have to go. That guy who came to class today? He knows people, right? I mean, so, do you think he could get us in? No, I don't...
- Lovers? Really? - She's kidding. Well, come on in. There's plenty of room for lovers. I'm here with three friends.
She talks a little bit too much, but she's... she's cute. You're gonna get me fired. You realize that? She's gonna tell her friends, and they're gonna tell their friends, - and they just keep talking.
- Yes, you will. There's a thousand guys up there who are harder than me. I mean, in a room, some junkie doesn't want to pay me, and Kostya behind me, I'm pretty scary. Up there, I'm a skinny white boy with no friends. Those guys are gonna use me up and end me.
You think my bar is more important to me than you, my only child? Give me the word, and we'll go. They'll find me. They'll find me sooner or later. You know how they find people?
Give me the word, and we'll go. They'll find me. They'll find me sooner or later. You know how they find people? They find them when they come home.
and you never come back. You never come home. We'll drive. We'll keep driving. Head out to the middle of nowhere.
We gotta talk to that profiler again. Call the mayor. Tell him we're back at square one. What? Your shoes. Yes?
He could have erased a file. - Anything else? - Yes, he's tall. He's 6'3", maybe 6'4". What about the pilot light?
They were physically shaking. Scared to death. - Of? - Because they thought this was gonna be another Waco. Because certain people... namely my ex-wife and other people, said I'm a radical, I'm a wild man, I got a gun under every arm, down every leg and every shoe, every corner of the house. You say anything to me, I'll shoot ya.
- How good a bowlers were Eric and Dylan? - When we played them, all I remember is they were just, like, crazy. They would just chuck the ball. - Chuck it down there. - Throw the ball down; didn't really care how they bowled. - Yeah, they didn't really care about their scores. Deputy Sheriff Steve Davis - What were the suspects doing the morning of attack?
- Huh? Why won't she move? - What's going on? - Man, all hell broke loose. Black people everywhere demanded their rights. White people had a major, freaky-feel meltdown and they were all, like: - Run away!
Why won't she move? - What's going on? - Man, all hell broke loose. Black people everywhere demanded their rights. White people had a major, freaky-feel meltdown and they were all, like: - Run away! Run away! - And they did. They all ran fleeing to the suburbs, where it was all white and safe and clean.
- What's going on? - Man, all hell broke loose. Black people everywhere demanded their rights. White people had a major, freaky-feel meltdown and they were all, like: - Run away! Run away! - And they did. They all ran fleeing to the suburbs, where it was all white and safe and clean. And they went out and bought a quarter-of-a-billion guns. And put locks on their doors, alarms in their houses, and gates around the neighbourhoods.
It's getting too risky. Everybody knows me up here. People want guns, drugs or alcohol, they come to my house and that's just too much. - Yeah, too much hassle. - My favourite statistic in all the research I did discovered that the murder rate had gone down by 20%. The coverage - that is, how many murders are on the evening news - it went up by 600%.
Anger does well, hate does well, violence does well. Tolerance and understanding and trying to learn to be a little different than you were last year does less well. - Does less well in the ratings. - Oh yeah. - Maybe because we, in the television business, because we tend to demonize black and Hispanic people, then those watching it at home are going: "I don't want to help those people.
- Actually, we've also had a much higher unemployment rate. When Michigan rate was running at 4%, we were still at 8-9%, We seem to have an institutional unemployment rate. - I think there'd mostly be white people in Canada. - Hmm... that's strange, 'cause when I'm in Canada, I see black people everywhere. And yellow people, and brown people... and 13% of the country is non-white.
Because that's all they see... The tragedies. We're just trying to crunch right now for the five and the six. Today, we're feeding CNN and Fox, so... - The national media had never visited Buell Elementary, or the Beecher school district in which it sat, or this part of Flint ever before. And few, if any, of these reporters bothered to visit it even when they were here now.
Buell and Beecher, and Flint, did not fit into the accepted and widely circulated story line put forth by the nation's media. That being the one about America and its invincible economy. The number-one cause of death among young people in this part of Flint was homicide. The football field, at Flint-Beecher, was sponsored by a funeral home. The kids at Beecher have won 13 state track championships, but they've never had a home track meet. Because around the football field, all they have is this dirt ring.
- I think American history is... uh... has a lot of blood on its hands. - And Germany history doesn't? - No. - And British history? - I don't think as much. - Oh, are you... Germans don't have as much, blood on their hands? - Uh, they do, yes. - The Brits, they ruled the world for 300 years at the barrel of a gun.
- So you have them for protection? - Yeah. - Have you ever been a victim of crime? - Never been assaulted or...? - No. - No violence toward you, but you have guns in the house.
But the time has come to come to understand that a Tech-9 semi-automatic 30-bullet weapon like that that killed my son, is not used to kill deer. It has no useful purpose. It is time to address this problem. - We have work to do, hearts to heal, evil to defeat and a country to unite. We may have differences, yes, and we will again suffer tragedy almost beyond description.
Go. Be careful! This doll is really pretty. Yeah? You think so, too?
Fucking dancer, wee man! This is our score. I know where they stash the drugs. We could get it nae bother. - What are you talking about? - The gear.
- I'm glad. Bye. I'll pay you back this time, guys. I promise. What are parents for, if not to bail their daughter and her friends out of jail?
Not that I don't love that look, but you could get dolled up occasionally. I'm not going to spend hours fluffing my hair and applying animal-tested makeup to my face just so I can turn myself into some male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll. Unless I, you know, really like the guy or something. You see, maybe that's the problem. You don't like these guys.
Look, whatever we lose on this deal, I'm in for half. You'll be in for nothing at the rate you're going. Expensive divorces, poolside parties at the hotel for 1000 people including fireworks and a performance by Sting. That was one special night. It was Wendy the concierge's farewell bash and a very good party if I say so myself.

Eyes as blue as a lake in spring They really are quite Denmark's thing The sun upon the meadows casts its light Let's sing "I'm the oatfield swaying low..." No! "Pick up your staff, Put on your breeches"... Sing them both simultaneously! - No, this one!
A fine quality in a surgeon, yes. In a Head of department, even. But not in a father. another thing: I Have never been able to say thank you. But Have no doubt that I am touched- - that you Helped an old man to face the past.
Ligature tweezers, left hand. Ligature tweezers, right hand. Suck, Riber, suck, suck, suck! Damn! I believe the ligature is still in place.
Look at her, look at him! Look at them!" And yet the Jews did so much good for those people. There were doctors, teachers, obstetricians among the Jews. Klara, the obstetrician, aided births in the entire village.
- Why couldn"t you do it? I don"t know. I suppose I could have if he saw me face-to-face... or if he had resisted, but he as just asleep. Revenge doesn"t change anything... and it cannot bring anyone back. When Jews prayed in synagogues... the prayers were sad ones.

When Jews prayed in synagogues... the prayers were sad ones. Why do women cry as they pray... during the feast of Shavuot?
Everyone in this film was a child during the war. They are children from the abyss, remnants of once large families... children who survived by pure chance. They come to us from the smoke which took away... their beloved parents, grandparents, sisters and brothers. They are among the very few... who miraculously survived out of so many. They came from the inferno alone, often naked... with no families or even pictures to remember them.

They come to us from the smoke which took away... their beloved parents, grandparents, sisters and brothers. They are among the very few... who miraculously survived out of so many. They came from the inferno alone, often naked... with no families or even pictures to remember them. Thus we sometimes show photos of other children... someone else"s brother or sister... but they come from the same smoke.
Before the war... the relationships between different people were fairly normal. There were some incidents... where drunkards on the streets... would call us kikes. But they were drunks... so we did not pay too much attention to them. And as for decent people... Raisa Dashkevich ...we had many Russian friends, without discrimination.
The Germans dragged them away as they screamed. Two beautiful girls. That"s when it began. It was a wild shriek. A wild cry.
Our Jewish partisan force... set politsai quarters on fire... and shot the politsai. Besides being a scout... I also went on reconnaissance missions. We liberated... prisoners of war and Jews near Minsk. Had it not been for the partisans... no one would have survived in ghettos. No one. The war was coming to an end... and like the rest of Europe, Germany was in ruins.
- But it will be for good, you'll see. - Why? You know, Inspector, you know. Because of those heavenly creatures you're always talking about? They are beings, heavenly beings who will come to take us.
is the monkey a quadruped or... how was it, a biparous? - A biped. - Biped, Marina, biped. Monkeys have evolved... In the animal evolving scale, there's no doubt monkeys have evolved.
Hurts like a mutha when I pee. Sorry to hear that, man. No, don't be sorry for me. See, I got discharge. What the hell you talkin' about?

Flyers, diplomas, it's all paper. Nothing you do really has any meaning. Why not? -Think about it. You're a speck of dust in a expanding crazy universe.
This discrepancy can be decisive in the case of canonization. Martyrdom only occurred in the second case. Especially, as Ettore and Erminio claim, your mother died forgiving her murderer. Without her pardon, no sainthood. Alas, Egidio neither confirms nor denies his first account. As you know he refuses to speak.
That enjoyment stayed with me and I don't think I could have done any other job. Even now, I realize, on the verge of retirement, that I love this work with the children. It takes time and personal involvement and the wonderful thing is the children return it. Your parents must have been proud of you. For them, a son who wanted to teach was a step up.
It takes time and personal involvement and the wonderful thing is the children return it. Your parents must have been proud of you. For them, a son who wanted to teach was a step up. And they fuelled that desire, even going so far as to make serious financial efforts. I felt somehow that I was obliged to succeed. For their sake too.

"There's a problem with the part-time job." "Call me when you get back." "I'm very sorry about the accident." It is thought that this limit on somatic cell division... ..thus limits the lifespan of higher organisms. Cell-lifespan is thought to be determined by "telomeres" DNA-protein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes that grow shorter with every cell division in the manner of coupons being used one by one.
They could be accidents. Maybe Schaft's stuff is defective. It could be terrorists. These environmental groups opposed to waterfront development attract their fair share of crazies. We've asked the Public Security Bureau to look into that.
Rock, huh? A rock show in a falling-down stadium? There won't be an audience here. "Goby" Giant goby?
God, they were really good. The tango is a... a difficult dance. And the... the women were all dressed up, you know, with their hair up. You just don't see that. They were wearing little high-heeled shoes with pointy toes.
All right? Or it's no good. And if you're lucky, it all comes together. You're in total sync. Hmm. But sometimes it's, uh... it's hard for these modern women.
We'll just take it a step at a time and, um, do what we can. Uh, you say one of the services is scheduled for this week. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, Thursday. So we'll do that one first.
You know, he was always taking them and pointing things out to them. Mm-hmm. He was real senior. Right. Right, yeah. He had been there 16 years. You have a lot of new guys coming through.
"He loved his family He loved this city. "On September 11, he was the senior man. "The younger men could look to someone who was... "steady and professional to show the way. "We know that Bill and the other firefighters of New York saved hundreds... "no... thousands of lives that day. "That means there are hundreds of people and thousands of their family members... "who are able to go on because of them.
It's like a baseball player. "And now pinch-hitting for Mariano Rivera, Hipolito Diaz." He's missin' too. He's missing with the guys from the engine company.
I mean, Pat could cover a room in two steps. I see him leading five guys up to a building and sizing it up. That's what they do when they get to a fire. They walk around, and they size it up. And I see these five guys, and they're running to keep up with him.

Eve was weak. You should've told me, Mama. The girls all made fun of me. Ask for forgiveness of your sin. I didn't sin. You sinned.

The number of Moroccans with Belgian nationality who showed up at the previous elections, wasn't really impressive. There is too much at stake this Sunday to stay in bed. If I'm elected, we'll have an extra vote in the local council. And that's one vote less for the Front. We must convince as many people as possible to vote for Mohamed.

Leilah, what happened? Where is your headscarf? None of your business.

It is difficult to endure three months of winter, then 4 or 5 months ... It's still cold in April. A guy was beaten up during demolition Ward 12. The promoter compensated.

A guy was beaten up during demolition Ward 12. The promoter compensated. It was not someone here but a thug used to evict people. In fact, it has been put down by the locals then it had to be the opposite. They are not as strong as they believe.

They've been building the dam for about twenty years. If the government was fair they would have resettled us long ago. Dampromotionalvideo The resettlement programme of those ousted by the construction of the dam has been clearly and adequately chalked out by the government offering the oustees an extremely fair settlement. They are better off today than they were earlier.
There is such good forest, so much grass and water and food for us. But everything will be destroyed. The helicopters came twice in two years. I was a child then. Government officials came here.

The rest I lost to this big canal. So my whole five acres has gone. All these canals have been constructed on our land. It is not fair. They should include us for resettlement.
It is not fair. They should include us for resettlement. We can't get our land back but they should replace what we lost. Now it's very difficult for us to survive. 100 kilometres downstream of dam
Our Gods have always lived here in things like trees and stones. The God of the whole region lived here so many people came for a festival each year. The God blessed the childless with a child. And people with farming or any other problems would come here to seek God's blessings. But now our Gods have been submerged.
Now today in areas where we do not have water, adequate water... Murkesh Patel President, GujuratChamberofCommerce ...clean water, what happens is that though there is potential for development, that development does not come up. Now when water will reach these areas, it will mean that there will be greater potential for the growth and development of those areas. More industries, more trade and business activities will come up. Gujarat has been traditionally very strong in the chemical front chemicals and pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry has to depend quite heavily on water.

Gujarat has been traditionally very strong in the chemical front chemicals and pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry has to depend quite heavily on water. Governments sell these projects with the view that they are in the interests of the people. And when you look at them closely, it all too often looks as though they're in the interests of engineering interests, construction interests and people who are already fairly prosperous rich farmers and industrialists. Now that's not nobody, but it's not the group that's used to justify the projects. The commissioning of the Sardar Sarovar project is the beginning of the End of Thirst.
We concluded that the projects were severely flawed as they stood and we recommended that the World Bank take a step backwards and they should pause and look very hard at what to do now with this project. See, Morse commission according to us itself was a misguided commission. We never accepted Morse observation. Which according to us are not only incomplete but erroneous. We felt that it was really a victory to have the World Bank withdraw from the project, and we thought that we have to now take up the challenge and challenge the government in turn. We have faith in our campaign.
Or do we simply disintegrate into nothingness? What becomes of our mind? Have you ever pondered the afterlife? Science has explained the cosmos. It is deciphering our genetic code.
What is it to die? Can it be avoided? Questions that... remain unanswered. Science has explained the cosmos and inner space, as well. It is deciphering our genetic code.
After Jamey, we don't know who we can trust. Where's my wife? We are talking about my family. Do you understand me? All I want is to get them back.
Listen carefully. We have your friend and we plan to kill him. Unless you do the following. A document was stolen from a Paris nightclub. It belongs to my employer. Though it appears to be a blank page, it has a great value to him.
- It just stayed with me. - Well, that guy was amazing. The story was about this man, Luis Maroma. He was a fruit picker from Mexico, an illegal immigrant living in Los Angeles and he worked for a man who was basically a slave driver. No, he was a slave driver. The conditions these people lived in, 18 sleeping in every room, one bathroom.
- Of course I value my life. - Do you? Your actions would indicate otherwise, so I'm gonna tell you what it is you are apparently dying to know. Your friend, Daniel Hecht, David McNeil's wife Susan, Eloise Kurtz, they were all innocent victims. Their deaths were unfortunate, a matter of circumstance.
We're waiting for the results. That's the second time Will's come through for us. I wish there were more I could do for him. He's a good guy. Thanks. This watch belonged to my father.
Defense approved it. I am not about to let Irina Derevko near six nuclear weapons supervised only by you. Plane leaves in an hour. Obviously, you can't maintain your cover if you're shackled. So there are two things you need to know about this necklace. It's layered with C-4.
- That's not an option. - Look. We need plausible deniability here. - The CIA cannot acknowledge SD-6. - I know that.
Thanks, Marshall. Sloane gave me the finger. - OK? - Yeah. Are you OK?
This is CIA Director Devlin, Deputy Director Tucker, Executive Director Kirstner, and senior officers Hayley, Stafford, and Colin. I knew weeks ago that my file had been pulled, and that you were suspicious of my activities 25 years ago regarding the KGB. When I learned that you had scheduled a meeting with Mr Devlin regarding... my history, I knew that it was time. Let me say in advance, I'm sorry to make this such a public display.
- The directives are 25 years old. There's no statute of limitation on murder. We need him right now. We will never destroy SD-6 without my father. Those code names in your father's books were people.
OK, fine. I'll do it. Rats are clever. You have to out-think 'em. You can't just leave out cheese.
You'll recall the ampoule stolen from us on behalf of Khasinau. We believed there was only one ampoule in existence. This conversation indicates the existence of two. It says Sark and a splinter group of the Raslak Jihad have agreed on the number of men each side can bring to the meeting. Each side has one principal and two backups located in the market.
Yeah. Of course. Thank you. The desert. We need to test your security system.
Watch out for that big old Washington giant, JJ. (Helen) Jack, I was wondering. I wanna talk to you about tomorrow night. Hope you didn't pay too much for these shirts. Not that much. I was wondering if it would be okay--
Just listen. People are talking about the game. Of course they are. City championship and all. They're saying that we're gonna lose, that some guys've been coming around, telling them to lose. Guys like who?
Yes, sir. North Philly. People would come this far? I tell you what's a fact. There's no stores like yours selling televisions down on Girard Avenue.
I've been trying to get a hold of you. I'm sorry, hon. I've been booked out the "wa" and past the "zoo." If I get any hotter they'll have to stamp me out. Lorne, I know you're busy, but we really need your help.
Got it? How'd you get it? Swiped it from his doctor's office. I don't know what good it will do you. Boys in the lab said it was completely normal.
-He's not even a man. -Nevertheless, he has a soul now. Yes, that he might know the pain he's inflicted on his countless victims. A brilliant curse, I admit. Gypsies have a knack for creative vengeance.
-Got it. Got it? How'd you get it? Swiped it from his doctor's office. I don't know what good it will do you.
We really want to go backstage. Okay. But this isn't so much a bribe as it is a tip. And since I' m not parking your car, there's really no way-- Okay. That's how we do it.
It might be good for me to go kick some ass. You scared me. - Um, I thought you were, you know... - Dangerous? Um, well, it's kind of a weird place to have a party.
Wait, where can I find you? There's a shelter on Durbin a few blocks south. You should get off the streets. No, wait. Word on the street are that these deaths are your garden-variety "goodbye, cruel world. " - Is there anything to eat in here? - The way they did it.
You were there for me when it mattered-- For both of us. And as for the rest of it, it's an act of faith, believing in someone. I believe in you... whatever your name is. Redmond. My name is Dinah Redmond. And I have been lying to you about everything. My mother left me with foster  <hon>parents<hoff> when I was six.
And as for the rest of it, it's an act of faith, believing in someone. I believe in you... whatever your name is. Redmond. My name is Dinah Redmond. And I have been lying to you about everything. My mother left me with foster parents when I was six. And they taught me to be ashamed of what I was, never to tell anyone...
Redmond. My name is Dinah Redmond. And I have been lying to you about everything. My mother left me with foster parents when I was six. And they taught me to be ashamed of what I was, never to tell anyone... to hide it. Then when I couldn't hide it anymore, they were gonna take me somewhere-- Somewhere to make my powers stop.
Lots of bills. Our solicitor sent her solicitor a letter and his solicitor is billing us for it. - Are you making coffee or not? - We need some decent stock. Stop, Mother of God, go and get your hair done!
I'm glad you think that, but there is a way to make very sure that it doesn't happen, isn't there? What's that, then? By having a proper contract and not a week-by-week arrangement. I'm sure in time that will happen. These things tend to evolve naturally.
The deadline cannot be extended, nor is there any other process of appeal. I won't discuss this matter in front of the press. I'm not here as a member of the press, Nathan, I'm here as the person who discovered the band. I think maybe it would be best if I deal with this, Stanley. I'll get old Nathan to drop the charges against Wesley.
Good evening, gentlemen. 'Night. Good night, ladies, very nice to see you again. Good night, gentlemen. Terrific, aren't they?
I'm very intrigued by how you've managed to meld it all together in a very sophisticated way, if you don't mind me saying so. You've taken the best of what you've heard from America, and made it your own. How did you learn to do that? I'm sorry, that sounded much too patronising. I think it was my experience on the ocean liners that helped me so much.
That's so true! Stanley, you know the Freemasons have temples in this hotel? They don't? ! Oh, yes, in the basement.
A four-month booking now? We just need to check if that includes all of them. I feel we need proof of that. I never make mistakes, Harry, as you know. No, sir, you do not.
Afraid. Yeah. They all are. The coven is... They're the most amazing women I've ever met.
That's everything he got. What's it highlighted for? It's a Riviera necklace. We loaned it to a couple for the fight, and they refuse to return it until we return the ring that they brought in for cleaning. Which was stolen along with the other items, right?
Pugilistic dementia. They say eight out of ten boxers suffer some form of brain damage later on in life. The Greatest... Muhammad Ali. Steele must've known what was happening to him. He would never admit it.
Being efficient is not a bad thing, Nick. Why you tossing me a softball, putting everyone else on real cases? You wanted to work solo. Yeah, but it's like Night of the Pifflings out there, and I'm on a smash-and-grab. Pifflings? Puffin offspring.
Round and round and round it goes. Where it stops, nobody knows. There was this one case where a boxer put lead shot in his gloves to increase his punching power. And also ancient Greek and Roman pugilists used a glove weighted with metal, called a "cestus." You making a classical reference? Yeah. I thought you'd like that.
that's Peter Berglund... and that's the Pacific. So what? I know Peter. You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife. The picture doesn't prove anything.
Ant hill. They're using this body as a colony site. I'm going to have to take this box and the specimen back to the lab as is. These insects are evidence. I followed up on the private mail depot for our snuff movie.
We had that lab do what's called a phylogenetic analysis of your HIV's DNA and Susan's. As you can see, the genes are identical. Which means Susan gave it directly to you. But we never had sex. You did stab her, though. And, at that moment... her arterial blood hit your eyes entering your body through the conjunctival membrane.
I need to talk to you. Uh... can it wait till after work? It's about work. When I tried to revive the victim, the bra was in the way, so I repositioned it. I didn't think about it until I was at the elevator.
No visible track marks. Tox screen came up empty except for botulin. Food poisoning? I'll know more when I cut open her stomach. Heard about the rat.
Okay, all right, remember where you are. Anything catch your eye? Not yet. All right. So, let's get everything back to the lab. We need to start the victimology and figure out why these three people got shot, okay? I've got one divot over here. Victim dropped in her tracks, bullet went through her head ... hit here, based on the teardrop shape.
Excuse us. What has gotten into you? I don't know. I just don't feel like myself. our job is to keep the innocent calm.
Here, hold this. So, anyway. If you need help on any cases, supernatural or otherwise, I'm at your service. I'm gonna prove to everyone that I'm not evil.
Trust me, your honor, I didn't make a good faith effort to try to notify my husband of our divorce. I made a great faith effort. But to grant a default divorce, the court requires that you put a notice in the local newspaper saying where the missing spouse was last residing. Did you do that? I made the notice larger than legally required.
I'll just have to find a way to turn her back. Look through these books. - You been working on this all night? - Yeah What have you learned so far?
I'd like to thank it and then kill it. Are you sure you're ok? Yeah. Never better. Ready to face my fears... like that painting.
The catch is it's protected in a secret chamber by his best guards. Now, I know how to get there. But I can't fight them alone. What do you say? Partners? I so don't trust him.
Yes. I suggested it was time you started acting a bit more like a proper dominant male, and you did a darth vader impression. Darth vader, while chiefly famous for breathing out, also... ( doorbell rings ) oh, Jeff, come on! Just coming! Well, you've got the key.
Wingspan of a jet. The thing breathes fire, titanium claws, some kind of screeching thing that makes people's heads explode... I just thought you'd wanna know about the group. Shankar says they're in the clear. - That's good. - We don't have to worry about exposure.
Okay, take my hand. Concentrate on the touch of my hand. Let's go. We have to find my friends. They're chasing me.
You're going to get lost! Are you okay? Where's Jill? I lost her. Bruce: What happened to you in there?
Stay there. Jill! Jill! I know this truck. It belongs to a local hood.
What? Come here, let's make a hockey team. Hey, listen, Why don't I go rent us so me movies for a rainy afternoon? Love you. The wheel of fortune turns. Round and round it goes.
- It's freezing. That's what you get bringing Weaver in on Halloween. - It's the biggest holiday for her kind. - Lesbians? Wiccans. Probably riding that crutch like a broom.
There's nobody matching your niece or your sister's descriptions or names have showed up at the morgues or the hospitals. - That's good. - Yeah. This happens all the time. You know that, right?
- Epiglottis. - Right. Lift towards the feet. - Harder. - Okay. Good. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, give me the tube. - Tube.
- He offered her hope. Is that so terrible? - For her, yeah, it is. You want him on the ward, I'll keep him there. No, just supervise him.
You want him on the ward, I'll keep him there. No, just supervise him. Patients are who they are. - I can't change how he sees them. - Well, it is a teaching hospital.
- Are you the ship's doctor? My people are dying. Will you allow him to help us? Any thoughts? They did come looking for us.
Are you asking out of personal interest or scientific curiosity? Both, I suppose. There's a crewman onboard I've become close with. I think she's attracted to me. In my experience, humans lack the emotional maturity for interspecies relationships.
Sir it would go against all my principles if I didn't ask you to reconsider... I have reconsidered. I spent the whole night reconsidering. And what I've decided goes against all my principles. Someday my people are going to come up with some sort of a doctrine. Something that tells us what we can and can't do out here. Should and shouldn't do.
- One out of three. It's a full-blown epidemic. These are in the most advanced stage. You're treating them with a synthetic antibody? It's effective at first, but the disease mutates.
I'm in command of this bridge. Your vessel has been impounded under the authority of the Takret Militia. When we return, you'll be charged with criminal conspiracy. I don't recognise your authority. I answer to Starfleet Command... and I'm under orders to use any means necessary... to keep my ship from falling... into enemy hands.
Maintain your course. That's an order. Go ahead. Travis, hope you're not still heading for that eddy. Our friends are gone. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We seem to have passed through the worst part of the storm. But it will still be a while before we can leave the Catwalk.
- He treats me like one. Well don't let him. When I was a kid we had no money my family. I had to work every day after school just to put food on the table. Now that makes you grow up pretty fast.
You sure know how to pick them. What does your father say about all this? We don't really talk about girl stuff. Not even the new Andy huh? Two and 10. Two and 10.
Everybody's kids. Maybe. Well. it's what the district thinks is necessary for the children to keep pace with the curriculum. Oh. curriculum. Curriculum.
"Legendary Running Backs of the NFL." That's sports. That's right. Ma. a sports book. A sports book! That's because that's what I liked!
I ended it with a proposition. Preposition, it's a prep-- oh my God! What? What are you getting so upset about? Because this is the end of civilization!
What's goin' on in there? What's the matter. Frank? I thought you were eating that last piece of pie. I'm helping Raymond with his school project. All right, then.
Forward is the truth. It's the lies that restrain us... May I cut in, son? Everybody? I want to propose a toast to my son and my new daughter.
It's gone. And he's left standing there... looking at himself... and he has nothing. Is this dog... smart enough to learn? It's too late. It is never...
I'll go below. You! You're dead. How many aboard the Leviathan, Braca? Thirty Peacekeepers... and Grayza.
I didn't see my parents like that very often. I never saw that in my sires. - ... definitely going. - Oh, no, no, no. You just want 'em to stay like that.
I'll get to it, Mom. That's me. Son-of-a-gun. Olivia, I can't wait to have a slice. Are you sure we shouldn't just cut to the cake?
It's well hidden. How could they find it? That was Lo'La's cannon. Someone is in my ship. It's gotta be the girls.
You hear that? Sparky, shut up! Don't forget to kill the traps. Oh, of course not. Traps are off.
No, please... no, lava... oh! I have the intruders cornered, but I... I could do with some help. Why? Shoot 'em!
- That is your plan? - Yeah. To hit him with a rock, when they have these like shield things? ! The shields work against pulse energy...
And pastries. And paté. I'm really not high. I just used to be fat. I have a villa in the Loire Valley you can stay in.
God, isn't she beautiful? Doesn't she look just like Rachel? I know everybody keeps saying that, but all I see is Vin Diesel. What do you think our baby will look like? Oh, God. Please. You.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. -Come, let's get some tea. -Okay. Oh, my! Look at that. Only three weeks to go. Did you pick a nanny?
I guess you were right I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry. - No, don't be. - You were an inspiration after all. - I was?
- Aw, pretty! - Yeah, good selection today. - You get everything? - And then some. Look. Chocolate turkeys, nice!
We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us. You're lucky it's in that order. My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie. How so? I called shelters to volunteer to serve food.
My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie. How so? I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving – you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down
- That's delicious. - Really? May I have another one for later please? Yes, that's fine. Take another one. Thank you. You know, my parents would love these sandwiches.
Thank you. You know, my parents would love these sandwiches. I wish I could bring 'em by but unfortunately they're in private bible study right now. Bible study? - Say, how long are you serving? - Why?
Do not let her stop or lay down, do you understand me? - But I... - I need you, Dean. - The team needs you. - What team?
- I like ruffles. - How can you like ruffles? - Because I'm very, very gay. Judy, Vincent has to go to work now. Goodbye Lorelai.
there were places like thunder mountain, where you come from, that place in greenbriar, virginia, bomb shelters for the government in case of nuclear attack, fallout shelters for schools, city hall, duck and cover, everything will be just fine, the radiation will just wash off in the rain, huh? but it was all bullshit, you know, except for the big ones, the ones the government was building. cold war ended, bug war started. anthrax in the mailbox, viruses in crop dusters, pretty soon they realized that these fallout shelters weren't worth shit.
the radiation will just wash off in the rain, huh? but it was all bullshit, you know, except for the big ones, the ones the government was building. cold war ended, bug war started. anthrax in the mailbox, viruses in crop dusters, pretty soon they realized that these fallout shelters weren't worth shit. what they needed was something that was not only radiation safe, but safe from biological and chemical warfare, safe for the shadow government, so they built 3 of them.
new delhi. why new delhi? i--i--i could never figure that out. why new delhi? why new fucking delhi? that's where the fucking experiments were going on.
his son survived, was taken in by the other guy. well, you know, i see him come around here sometimes. he's pretty messed up, you know, but i guess if your dad had killed half the world, well, i guess that'd be the kind of thing that'd screw anybody up pretty bad, you know? now, the researcher, i don't know his name... devon! i think i do.
they took kids, did experiments on 'em, tried different drug cocktails. eventually, they got what they thought was a working vaccine. just one problem. what's that? you know how sometimes when you used to get a flu shot, you got the flu? yeah. about a year after getting the injections, some of the test subjects who got the vaccine against the big death developed a form of the virus.
no, it's our only chance. wait! god. check it out, ok? is there a problem? you have 2 guys check it out. i don't know, man. we haven't heard back from the guys yet we've got guarding the roads.
check it out, ok? is there a problem? you have 2 guys check it out. i don't know, man. we haven't heard back from the guys yet we've got guarding the roads. they're supposed to check in every half-hour. they might just be late. they're not the most reliable guys around. marcus, you should go back downstairs until we-- no.
This is so awful! He was so... What was Dr Feldman drinking at the reception? Red wine. He only ever drank red wine.
- Actually, it was her idea. - Sorry. I found one weapon that's a match. A .32-calibre Rossi 88 with a silencer. Recovered in a drug bust in White Plains.
The boys got it for me for the years of service. They gave it to you brand new? Well, yeah. A couple of years ago. Really? This is a vintage watch.
We didn't know she was pregnant. She didn't tell us. Martha knew. She put her teddy bear in the coffin. Not for your mother, for the baby. Martha was probably excited about the baby.
- Gump and Worsley. Kevin Reddick's old employer. They were in my apartment, in my bedroom. They looked through my things. They touched everything.
It's the shadow by the hypothalamus. The limbic system, that governs emotion and motivation. - You've studied the field? - By necessity, yeah. We have a family history of schizophrenia.
Thank you for understanding. The woman is obviously not Barbara. I saw nothing! I knew you'd understand. To our wives and lovers.
Now, if you don't mind, Tim Daly wants me to read the script for him. You really think he killed his wife? He always thinks people are killing each other. That's true. And I'll tell you why.
The notary public who was supposed to have signed this was on a cruise in the Caribbean on October 4. We were in the file room yesterday. You see the little tabs at the top? Some are on the left, some on the right, some in the middle. Mr. Pratt had a system. When he put files away, he alternated them left, right, middle...
Your uncle was dying, and you knew you'd been cut out of the will. So you wrote up a phony will, where you inherited everything. And, of course, you had to kill Lou Pratt. He was your uncle's attorney, and he would've spotted the forgery. And after you killed him and his assistant, you put the phony will in the file, but you couldn'tjust stop there. The cops would've wondered, "Why was Lou Pratt murdered?"
My husband was very organized, so I guess it kind of rubbed off. Hold it! May I? That's got it. May I say something?
If you want to browbeat me, you'll have to wait til the next session. That's not what I wanna do, Karen. And you know that. Why did you come here? Listen, when you... do what I do, right, you see people at a very vulnerable place.
It was never you, it was just... It was life. Life did something to me. Look at these hands... What have you been doing? Scrubbing floors? They used to always look so perfect.
Sister, can you get out a press release to the effect that it's impossible to determine the extent of Cyril's culpability? I mean, he knew he did something wrong, but he has no sense of the gravity. A press release isn't enough. We should hold a press conference. I want to make it clear that I was never able to discuss the specifics of the case with Cyril, that he did not actively participate in his own defense. Father Meehan, do you really think we can pull this off?
After all, it's just... Didn't see any reason For people to be subjected to... Excuse me, Everyone. I'm lindsay, lynnette's sister, And i'd like to congratulate her and her husband On this special occasion. To stand in front of your family and friends... And to declare your love and commitment In the eyes of god and... The law I know, because i've shared a commitment with my partner For six wonderful years, Even though we're not married.
Lynnette. It's a beautiful wedding. Just like they've all been. Thank you. The chicken was delicious. It was a capon.
Signing contracts, making pacts, Taking vows. No. Not now. It'll be a total disaster. A catastrophe. But... On a positive note, Ah. So, what do you get two dykes who have everything? Dykes don't have everything.
Thanks. Wow, so many to choose from. Pear shape, melon shape. Each with its own unique personality. God. How am i ever going to decide? Well, sometimes it helps to see them in the flesh.
Not by these people. I think you do. In fact, you should've been marketing to them in the first place. Fags? Their money's as green as the next.
Come on, sweetie. It's time for your ride. Listen, i'm sorry If your plans got fucked up, but... I didn't force her. Well, you sure didn't stop her. That bike was practically forgotten Until you had to remind her.
Yeah. So? So? He hates us. What he does with his money is his business.
I can't stop obsessing about this date. What do you think I should do? You should go ahead and thank your lucky stars you finally found a gal who's into same-sex relationships. - You know, Perry... - Perry? I'm trying it out.
You had to go to the principal's office. I have an early shift tomorrow. - I've got to sleep. - Want me to take you home? But if we're gonna pick up a schoolgirl outfit and have sex, we have to leave this minute.
I did too. Dear God. Why don't we just say something to him? - Like what? - I don't know.
- I don't know. "I heard your songs and they're extraordinary"? Elliot, don't. - I won't. - Pinkie swear.
All right. Cool. - Hey, Number Two. - Number One! The best part about working here is the patients.
- And you were able to eat? - I'm entitled to a chemical peel. Wait! No! The hat was good!
My plus one dumped me for a shrimp waiter. I'd love to leave, but I have to stay. I'm like the ice sculpture the party's supposed to happen around. I had to let him go, correct? I just wish he'd told me right up front.
- Yes, it is. - Berger. - We're on a last-name basis now? Okay. Would you, by any chance... want to be my plus one on Thursday? It's my book party, and I don't have a date... and you'll have the clean shirt and all.
-Yeah. Have you had any pain or difficulty urinating? -No. -Any penile or anal discharge? No.
This is a wonderful idea, Lana. I realize we haven't had much time alone since I started seeing Dean. Actually, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. - Dean's a really great guy. It's just... - Let me guess.
I didn't know if it was some downed specialty aircraft or a Russian satellite. No, no, no, this thing's got extraterrestrial written all over it. I bet there's little green guys running around the cornfield too. I'm serious, Clark. Have you ever seen anything like it?
You liked the tables the way they were. Am I that transparent? I've already had a long talk with Dean, and I told him you're very independent and before he goes offering any more unsolicited advice he should... Well, he should get to know you better. Thanks, Nell, I really appreciate that.
- What's going on? - Wait here. Doesn't leave much room for interpretation. It was pretty weird. I mean, the door was shaking.
Lex, I've told you this Smallville is your test. Thanks for the update, but I know what I'm doing. No, you don't. She is playing the only card she's got and you are falling for it hook, line and sinker. My personal life is my business.
You should see the veterinarian bills. Fucking racket. Know what I think we should do, if you don't mind my saying? Switch her shoes to those titanium ones that Heshie was telling me about. They don't weigh anything.
The economy? It sounded like a wonderful opportunity. What are you gonna do? Waldorf-Astoria for horses back here. Groom, trainer, three meals a day.
Come forward. My host tells me you seek to help the Pangarans, despite what they have done to me. This has all been a terrible mistake, but not a malicious act. Nor was mine, Major Carter. You know, back on my home planet, my people discovered a substance that had an incredible potential to generate energy.
What is it? My scans indicate massive cellular degeneration. Quite simply, she is dying. I am sorry. The Pangarans sugar-coated the whole side-effect aspect of the drug. Well, that's a shock.
You know, back on my home planet, my people discovered a substance that had an incredible potential to generate energy. And after years of research and a serious lack of moral fortitude, they used it to make a bomb. Well, that being the reason I left. But the point is that your people had good intentions. We thought we had found the cure for all disease.
We remove that consciousness, the countdown will start up again. How long will we have when the countdown resumes? Approximately 17 minutes. Plenty of time to get out of here after we've got Thor. I know Thor was a friend of yours, but this is a Goa'uld mothership.
- Pushing the engines, six hours. - But we may already be too late. - I know this may seem unimportant now, but I might as well tell you. I figured out why the Goa'uld population isn't growing. Colonel? Nice.
- Starflight, it's all we got. - What about the hyperdrive? - Colonel, it didn't work. We just don't know where it'll send me, right? (O'Neill) Who cares as long as it's a galaxy far, far away?
- It is a simple matter. Lord Svarog has claimed Latona as part of his domain. Your conquest will happen, as sure as the sun will rise. Accept that... and you may live to serve him. My people have no desire to serve anyone.
- I've sent a messenger to the Sentinel to seek the answer to that question. Perhaps it is waiting. You will see. Our enemy will be sent away. How, exactly?
They take over the bodies of people. My people are innocent. They have done nothing to deserve this. I can't stay here much longer. You've got to make a decision.
So the replicators got to the time-dilation device before it activated. That appears to be the only explanation. So what do you want us to do? Fly your ship through replicator-dominated space, repair whatever damage may have been done to the time-dilation device, and activate it before the replicators can stop you. Thor, buddy... there's no way.

They created a bubble around the replicators, within which time was slowed down by a factor of... - 10 to the fourth power. - Relatively speaking, sir, one year to the replicators would be about 10,000 years to the rest of us. A day would be... I get it. The point is, if the plan had worked, it would have bottled the replicators up in one place and bought the Asgard many years to solve the problem.
Yes. Yes, Michael, we are. Cool. Donna first. So you smooched the Cannon. How was her tongue?
The driver says,"When do you have time to farm? The farmer says,"No, that's when I fill the hole with water." We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy.
We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince us they care about new energy and they're not in the pockets of big oil. And that's a tough sell. I don't envy them.
I think we noticed. Where are Josh and Toby? - In the soybean fields with Cathy. - Cathy? The daughter.
- Why? - Stepped on it. He has trouble concealing his displeasure. Stepped on it and he knows it too. - Look... - What do I say to people who ask why we subsidize farmers when we don't subsidize plumbers.
What kind of schmuck-ass system can this... - Good! That's perfect! - How did...? I don't understand. Perfect! Just the break I'm looking for! What? People, they just... They...
- It's why I haven't gotten married. - That's probably why. - Congressman Lien. - Could somebody get Leo for me, please? You hear that? He called you congressman.
About 110 miles as the crow flies. What's the best way to get to Unionville? - We'll take you. - Really? Yeah. It's a chance to show you the soy diesel car.
- Thank you. The president of the United States. Thank you very much. Thank you. "Joy cometh in the morning," Scripture tells us. I hope so.
Yeah. I forgot for a second that you're hilarious. Let's say the Republicans nominate Ritchie. - They will. - First of all, let's stop for a moment and say,"Why?" They got serious guys in the field Kalmbach, Daniel, Weston.
They can't be in the company of any man other than a close relative. Their dress code is so strict that it'd make a nun look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery, rape and drug trafficking. They have no free press, no elected government, no political parties and the royal family allows the religious police to travel in sixes carrying nightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But Brutus is an honorable man.
- I don't know. A kid wrote to the president saying that when he was campaigning he met his assistant, Mr. Farley. Probably one of the guys from early on. I didn't know them. It couldn't have been that early.
For why should our two nations still possess the power to destroy themselves 10 times over? Surely once is enough." Now, I have to tell you, sir, that both these negotiators had conversational English, but they didn't have idioms. - I promise you. -"Stem the tide" is an English idiom.
No, I'm just talking. Listen, you're already credentialed to cover our president. It's just putting you on the plane. Before I do that I wanna check the State Department to make sure it's not a grotesquely insulting thing to do to a new president from whom the U.S. is hoping for quite a bit. So your First Amendment only extends as far as is polite?
Grotesque oppression isn't okay just because it's been institutionalized. If you ask me, we should've gotten into the game three, four decades ago but they're coming for us now. So it's time to saddle up! - Toby. - We do know what's right.
- It was personal. - It was personal? - Yeah. Well, that always works well with him. What has he said about the speech?
And it must've been Becky. Maybe she was calling me for help. I didn't answer it. These women were clients of mine, nothing more. And the receipts from the party room?
Maybe she was calling me for help. I didn't answer it. These women were clients of mine, nothing more. And the receipts from the party room? How do I know how they get up there?
They were found by fishermen off the western coast of Africa. Two years ago, I traveled there to study it, and I took these. What has this to do with Follmer? I was called into the deputy director's office and shown an exact copy of that rubbing. I was asked by senior staff to identify it for them.
What has this to do with Follmer? I was called into the deputy director's office and shown an exact copy of that rubbing. I was asked by senior staff to identify it for them. - Where did they get them? - A guy running the border from Canada.
- A case they never told us about. - Where's this cult supposed to be? North Dakota. At some point they disappear into Canada. Agent goes along with them, fbi loses contact with him.
But only into Beta-Crypt three... A language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy. Doesn't that machine make noses? Lt can do other things.

I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps jacking off. - Maybe you've got brain cancer. - You think? Well, don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman. You're gonna fall off and break it! The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend.
She volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend. But do you hear about her on the news? No. Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside, there are two people who have adopted needy children. They were strangers to those kids once.
I don't know you! Oh, hey, kid! Oh, thank God you happened by! My chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks! If you hadn't have shown up, well... Anyway, could you give me a push?
I didn't come here to replace her. I'm just visiting everyone's workplace because I'm new. Kana loves it here. I can tell. I see. with those wings of yours... they make me think she might just fly away on me one day.
Kana! Wait. again! Get out! Damn birds!
First, there's the demons, then we open up a tomb. We're toast. Remind me, what are these demons supposed to be doing? They're a native version of the legend of the Incubus and Succubus. They would take people from their homes to the woods, and sometimes, the women would come back pregnant.
- Is that the carbon-dating report? - Yeah. Well, how old's our body? It's about... six years old, give or take. Yeah. The wrappings are bed sheets. They date back to the early 1960s.
I sneak up when she's asleep, leave her food and water, but I can't get her into town. I'm afraid she'll look at me. What happens when people look at you? I don't know, exactly. When my brother and I were kids... we used to just scare folks, mostly.
None of that is true. What won the war was secrets... knowing theirs and keeping ours. Gentlemen, meet the Enola Gay. When the Enola Gay dropped her payload on Hiroshima, only 107 men in the entire country knew what that specific payload was. The B-29 had been redesigned to carry its load, and a new crew, selected to carry an atomic bomb, was onboard.
- It's being prepared. - Thank you, Captain. We were just coming up over this rise. It's a real one, isn't it, sir? Most people change kind of slowly.
Most people change kind of slowly. They're who they are. and then after a while. they're someone else. But some people know the exact moment where their lives changed. They saw the person they were going to marry or the look in their baby's eyes the first time he smiled. For some people. it's not the good things in life that made them change.
No, it was ours. Spy balloon, highly classified, A-1. That weird metal, all of that- Part of the project. Some flying saucer, eh, sir?
By definition, their motives, their behaviour, everything about them would be... alien. So how much longer do we wait? That's entirely up to you. What's a five-letter word for "idiot"? This whole culture is built on a fear of death.
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of kings failed. The White Tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. Mordor.
And you believe that these Cast Out... might be responsible for what happened the other day? The possibility makes my blood run cold. If the Cast Out exist, they would camouflage themselves as something else. We would not permit them to live if we knew. Gurney, contact your old smuggler allies, the ones in the deep desert.
No matter what the cost. You handled that well. Shut up. As you wish, milady. We found their clothing near the bakery, Stilgar.
You handled that well. Shut up. As you wish, milady. We found their clothing near the bakery, Stilgar. We're certain they're no longer in the sietch.
Be quiet! We cannot abandon the desert. My daughter is lying. The worms will not survive if the desert shrinks. She knows this.
It doesn't matter. Sooner or later, the day comes when you can't hide from the things you've done. So let me get this straight. You're saying that the Cylons found a way to use your navigation program to disable our ships? Essentially, yes.
Thank you. Must be hard for you. What do you mean? Just having something you created twisted and used like this must be horrible. The guilt?
- Is that what he was doing to you? - I don't know what he was doing but I know what it felt like. It felt like I was back in that hallway. It felt like dying. The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.
Is that why there are no young men on the Council? Good point. Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor. There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply.
Good point. Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor. There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works.
- Is he here? Neo, it's from the Oracle. It's time to go. Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen. I don't know.
Flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure.
There's our path. Can you see it? Three lines. Power lines. Follow them.
The answer is simple. I love my daughter very much. I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. But where we are from, that is not enough. Every program that is created must have a purpose.
So do I. Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in. Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it. Tell me just what the hell is happening to me. The power of the One extends beyond this world.
Someone from another world is responding to me. I've succeeded in my research ! I've achieved a breakthrough, Sonia! We must inform the space centre immediately. You see this Research Centre, Dr Mehra?
They say day-dreaming is a bad habit. I must go home, to bed. They don't realise that every discovery or find is initially a dream. Don't be disheartened. People in the world always reject new findings... but accept them later.
- Why not? They become boyfriend and girlfriend only when they exchange kisses. So what should he do? My Mummy's absolutely right. Men are real idiots.
- There is. A brain surgery. However... - What? Chances of success in this case are very bleak. If the surgery fails, his whole body could be paralyzed.
I feel all drugged-up. Our collective hearts weep. Well, we just wanna know what happened out there. Oh, you wanna know what happened? Well, there are degrees of truth, captain.


- OJ? Like the murderer? No. Like the football player. OJ Simpson. I've set the alarm.
Catches nightmares keeps them away. Keeps you safe down here. I've had enough nightmares. Been doing that all night. I ate some berries in the dark.
- You don't know shit. - Name it! I'll name it after we come up with a small wager. - 50 bucks. - What's the subject?
- Name it! I'll name it after we come up with a small wager. - 50 bucks. - What's the subject? In the movies, when people wake up together they immediately start kissing and going at it.
I lost my temper there. But that little worm did something worse. The pretty mom he let pass this morning? She's down at the barn right now crawling with the Ripley. Twenty-five years, Owen.
Ian, I don't know if I can do this anymore. Daphne, he's your father. You've flown halfway around the world to see him. You can't turn back now. He's got a family now, I mean....
Once upon a time there was a young, very cool singer named Libby who one day decided to go out and see the world. Little did she know that in the deserts of Morocco fate was waiting for her and his name was Henry. They fell madly, passionately, hopelessly in love and were married by the chief of a Bedouin tribe. Henry brought her to England to meet his family so they could get married for real. But fate was not so kind this time.
-Why would she be threatened? -Her mother is about to marry my son and gain a title and all that goes with it. For years, Alistair tried to elevate his position through my husband's career. Now he's got his claws into Henry. People like Alistair and Glynnis, social standing is everything.
Nice! So tell me, Obi-Wan, where did you learn your impressive skills? Well, if you really want to know, believe it or not... -...my mother was a deb. -Really? Yeah, and then she chose to marry beneath her. Her parents promptly disowned her.
I want to paint an idol. When I first came here, I was posted to one of the outlying islands. I was the first missionary ever to go there. I'd been warned about idol worship. But nothing prepared me for what I found.
The craftsmanship. The delicate beauty. That human hands created these windows, that human eyes looked at these windows. And then you realize that you're 12, 500 feet beneath the sea. Oh, look at that woodwork. That's all wood, Genya. That's all carved wood.

I hear you speaking that gibberish "worm" language with everyone else. They are ashamed! They're reluctant to associate with you! But it is our language. I do not speak in "worm".
I would be lost without Gommi and the others. I could not have survived without them. nor built this vessel to return to my home. Where is your home ? Very far from here. My queen, this thing resists your attacks.
- I don't know. Where the socks go? - Or maybe we're on pause. - What? - Like a video game. You hit the pause button, and everything just stays in that one place... and to the characters... that one moment becomes their whole world, because it's the only thing that exists to them.
- What? - Like a video game. You hit the pause button, and everything just stays in that one place... and to the characters... that one moment becomes their whole world, because it's the only thing that exists to them. Do you think the characters ever know they're on pause? - They don't know anything. They do what they're programmed to do.
- Not without paying for it. - We would pay for it... - Right. - But our records say this address doesn't exist. - Of course it exists! - Not according to our records, see?
You take good care of yourself, Larry. I'II do that. Brian, Iet me ask you something. How do your fingernails look? -My fingernails?
In traditional Tai Moi Chai, there are five levels of digital orb extrusion. That's the gouging out of your opponent's eyeball... with one's finger. The highest and most difficult to master is my personal favorite: Kai Toi Mai. loosely translated, that's "the rip that takes the past."
Skittles? No, thanks. Listen. I got a call from Manetti. He tells me that your Sunshine Square proposal is totally fucked. What's wrong with it?
- Then... It's a wedding party. We can't tell them there is a vampire. Is the compass working? It's stopped moving now.
Something horrible could happen at any moment. Master, we found it! - Where? - Towards the southeast! This is the grave of a general, but it's been tampered with.
- Where? - Towards the southeast! This is the grave of a general, but it's been tampered with. If the corpse is still inside, that means it hasn't changed yet. We must blow up the tomb.
Stand up. Jump. Coldest just before sunrise. Good morning. You should put your shirt on.
You're not going to believe this... but some LA producer called and wants to do a play about my life. Call me back. Call me here. Delusions of grandeur. See, I think comics can pretty much be an art form, man.
Even change. And, dear.... Oh, shit! Ever since I read your stuff, man, I've been thinking... I can write comic book stories... that are different from anything that's been done. I figure the guys who are doing animal comics... and superhero stuff, they're really limited.
Ever since I read your stuff, man, I've been thinking... I can write comic book stories... that are different from anything that's been done. I figure the guys who are doing animal comics... and superhero stuff, they're really limited. Because they got to try to appeal to kids. And underground stuff like yours has been really subversive... and it's opened things up politically... but there's still plenty more to be done with them, too. Pass the ketchup.
Ry! Hey, Ry! - It's hot under here. - You saw it, Dale! No, I didn't!
But it was here that I got my real education. I became a member of what in those days was kind of a Freemasonry - the Freemasonry of cinephiles. What we'd call "film buffs". I was one of the insatiables. The ones you'd always find sitting closest to the screen. Why did we sit so close?
All our neighbors moving away... and all these new people remodeling the houses. They're stirring up rats. Well...have you been to the basement? No. You know I can't.
Cover my car." Ugh! Do you like my new S-55, Willard? M y hew oca vr M y hew M evrocedes saw you d vroo hg ovvevr t Do you know why I have that car? I'm driving that 350-horsepower, V-8 masterpiece... for you and your fellow employees.
Do you like my new S-55, Willard? M y hew oca vr M y hew M evrocedes saw you d vroo hg ovvevr t Do you know why I have that car? I'm driving that 350-horsepower, V-8 masterpiece... for you and your fellow employees. You see, buyers feel a sense of security... when they can see proof... that they're dealing with a successful man.
You're a good grifter, man. It's hard to tell when you're lying. But I'm getting there. Come here, girls. Now listen, it's the first time I've ever put girls in the booth.
Then maybe you can help explain to us what's so difficult - about getting a corporate loan? - Well, normally, nothing. But a tech firm right now? People are really scared.
It does not leave this fucking table. - Sure. - Fine. You know how the dot commers did what they did, right? In what way?
- Sure. - Fine. You know how the dot commers did what they did, right? In what way? How they made their money.
A few years ago we were working in Tampa for a local goon. Turns out this mutt was being watched by the Feds, which now meant we were being watched by the Feds... one in particular... Agent Gunther Butan. We were just overseeing some creative importing, so he really didn't have anything on us. But I figured, maybe this guy's good for a fix.
So I'm dead. But can I really blame Lily? Should I just have trusted her? Who knows? Sooner or later, someone's gonna start asking the right questions.
Manzano and Whitworth would ask how the drugs got into that duffel bag. The King and Price would ask, where their money really went. And everyone would ask, what agency was it that Special Agent Gunther Butan really worked for? You need a ride? Smooth.
That's not what I meant. Where do you want a synthetic implant? I mean... is it possible... everywhere? And can l fly afterwards? My name is Joachim Hauser, born November 27, 1974.
Take one step and the shit won't let go of you. - Not all marriages are the same. - They are. Only the shit changes. There's porous shit, runny shit... Women are only cute until their wedding day.
Really! How do you know pigs don't feel the cold? How do you know pigs don't feel the cold? For Heaven's sake! Women are only interested in us to get married and have kids.
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin. - No! Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin! No, Col!
- Nein! - Ja, darling! Right, the Christmas party, not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise. - Tell me. - It's basic, really.
You know what? I better be going. No, I'm sorry. Do you want to come over for dinner next week? - Are you sure? - Yeah, no, I would really love you to.
Why do you have to listen to this stuff? Why can't you listen to music like normal people? No one's normal, Mom. No such thing as normal people. Some muffins for the girls, for breakfast.
You mean those guys in shorts who didn't sing. Oh, you're wrong there. They did sing, but their producer wouldn't let them. He practically blackmailed them and said he would tell everyone their secret, and he got all the royalties. It was so unfair.
We started a pool out at Rushmore today. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. It's crescent-shaped. It's going to look wild.
I should have given you a raincoat. Come on in. - It's got a bit wet. - Don't worry about it. What happened?
Yeah, I'd love to. Great. Diet food, I hope. I don't want to ruin my diet. It's cold in the supermarket, and you like it like that.
...and then the Little Mermaid said to the Taxi Driver "I wanna see New York City. Please, show me New York. " 'Cause it's so big. You can't... you can't just walk around New York.
Please, show me New York. " 'Cause it's so big. You can't... you can't just walk around New York. So the taxi driver took her to the Empire State Building, and you know it's so high it has two elevators because they couldn't find just one cable to build one, you know? They had to build two.
'Cause it's so big. You can't... you can't just walk around New York. So the taxi driver took her to the Empire State Building, and you know it's so high it has two elevators because they couldn't find just one cable to build one, you know? They had to build two. So he got on the first elevator and then on the second elevator that's as fast as a space rocket, and they got to the top of the Empire State building and the Little Mermaid was looking down and she said
It's good. It's good! It's a wonderful thing. No matter how filthy something gets, you can always clean it right up. There were so many, I just gave them all what they wanted.
So what do I do? Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce. It's a magic trick. A single mom who's working two jobs... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle. A teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education, that's a miracle.
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary. I'll take it. Then what?
And then these things came and they attacked the rave. They started killing everybody. Those of us that could get away did. We ran. We finally got to the boat, but it wasn't there.
Are you sure this is where the boat's supposed to leave from? Maybe Johnnie gave you the wrong info. Yeah, hon. I'm pretty sure. It says here the boat doesn't leave until 5:00.
- It's not working right now... - I should check the cable modem. Yeah? OK, right. Over here. I paid thirty grand for some punk kid to install it.
- It's Israeli made. It's got a glass relock system. There's a pane of glass here. If I don't drill perfectly, steel rods snap into place and we can't open it. Then we're up shit creek. I think I just cracked the glass.
But they didn't get a big star. Big stars think it's too dangerous here. Big stars, you know, they like doing benefits, But only if the benefits Are held in places Where they won't get shot at. Oh, man. Let me ask you. With any big balls? Any goddamn brains or charisma?
Get the hell out of my face. Hey, I got one for you. What did the monkey say to the leopard At the card game? "I thought you were a cheetah." He's good. He's great.
Beautiful animals. Oh, thank you, But it's God deserves the credit. They don't have time to bother with success or getting rich. They don't have fantasies of glory. They don't borrow money to buy things That decrease in value while they own it.
Oh, thank you, But it's God deserves the credit. They don't have time to bother with success or getting rich. They don't have fantasies of glory. They don't borrow money to buy things That decrease in value while they own it. See, they're beautiful because they just are.
The zoo, the aquarium, They are--they are prisons for the animals. These animals cannot learn anything from mankind. Man doesn't have a thing to teach them. I abhor looking at human beings. Disgust me so much With their atom bombs and blow-dryers and automobiles.
A crack in the mud at the bottom of a sun-dried dead lake, I count that more beautiful than any human being. I know what you mean. Kind of like a curse, isn't it, being born? You got that right. Yeah, because we live in fear, Because we know we're going to die.
You know, what pipe of power you smoking from? Come on, man, tell me. You're supposed to have all the answers. What makes you tick, man? You like people to fall on their knees, right, And fall all over you, huh? I don't do that. That's why you don't like me, right?
Fine. I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof... if there is any. How could you trust him over me? Because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal. I love you... like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
Jake. So, what do you say? Do you want a ride? Yeah, I'd like that. Here you go. You can wear my extra helmet.
Shh! Shh! Don't scream. Just listen to us. We are half a block from the house of blues. Tell 'em you're going to the bathroom, do the song, you'll be back before they know you've gone. I tried to learn your solo, and I suck.
Henry Irwin's still sick. I'm sorry, Father. You got anything to keep his spirits up and his fever down? If I was those parents, I'd be ashamed. Most parents can't see their child ill.
There's a novel about you, too. I started to collect these. This is the first one I grew. I'm not saying this boat that you've built isn't worthy. From the looks of it, you've done a mighty fine job.
- We died? - Because you waited for a sign. It never came and you three died. But why? That's the exact question you'd ask God.
By magic? By science. He's a doctor who lives in the city. Can he cure you of worms? City people don't get sick the way we do.
Please, could you tell us do you know how far it is to the ruins in Jobal? I'm not sure. I've never traveled here before. I think he said he doesn't know this area. Well, at least he speaks Spanish.
How do you know all this? They brought me here with three girls. The girls washed their clothes cooked for them and did it with them. And I did all the other work. Were they prostitutes?
Before the killing began there were threats. Anonymous notes things painted on the church. But the people begged him not to go. They thought that if he stayed, God would protect them. The army burned Los Sueños, which was above the village but the people there had all become Baptists.
Nobody was interested in politics. So when the army came their only thought was to hide. The comandante left us this list of five men. Five men and our Padre. These are men he says we must execute.
The comandante left us this list of five men. Five men and our Padre. These are men he says we must execute. - What have they done? - He says they are subversives.
There is no such place. How do you know? When I was in the army they talked about this place. But we never found it. So it's really well-hidden.
That win this race. Find your final resting place. Gotcha. What is life? Who are we?
I got a jet, I just didn't fly here. Mr. Jennings, I can assure you that he has plenty of money, and he always pays his debts. Now his marker is good at this table. You are called. Fuck it, it don't matter.
Wow. Charlie: Maybe it's just a fucking myth. Maybe Stevens made the whole thing up. It's a great fucking story, though. Yeah.
- Not sure yet. We think he's connected to malini's crew. Witnesses? The waitress in back. She didn't see anything.
- Fill it up, please. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, shit! Are you all right? I just took my ring off in the washroom and dropped it.
Go on! Leave! Leave now! Take him and leave! My husband was killed in our house. You know me... Well?
The minorities will be the majority. The smartest thing we can do... is be the first party to nominate a minority for President. -How about a cripple? -I don't think so, Charlie. Now, we'll lose, of course, but the minorities will be happy.
You got my word. Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back! Okay. I got to go. Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, alderman of the 9th Ward of Washington, D.C. Not the part of D.C. you're familiar with. I work in a neighborhood so bad, you can get shot while you're getting shot.
You got a brother there. Then the people will find out what you're all about. Yeah, but I don't even know what I'm all about. In the latest polls, Mays Gilliam is up just one point, to 10 percent. Vice President Brian Lewis still holds a commanding 84 percent.
That's what I said. You know nothing about Nato? I know nothing about NATO. Why are you out here since inmates don't have the right to vote? It's not about the vote.
You know nothing about Nato? I know nothing about NATO. Why are you out here since inmates don't have the right to vote? It's not about the vote. We're looking out for the convicts. We want to make sure when they get out that they stay out.
If I was 12, I'd have a gun, too. Tell me you didn't say that. I didn't know the camera was on me. I was playing around with some sound guy. You didn't know the camera was on you?
I mean, I never did. And without you... Some people say this is the easy way out. It's taking more courage than anything I've ever done before. Look at me, I'm shaking.
Like a regular police uniform? He was a cop. He took Davey. - So, what were you guys doing? - We wrote our names in the cement...
- Straight up. Here's Sal. About fucking time. Hey, there, bad boy. This should be the city's, but the park's state jurisdiction. So if the body's in there, the case is ours.
- I heard a car hit something. - Hit what? Another car? - Oh, no, not loud like that. - Like hitting the curb? Yes, maybe.
Brendan Harris confirmed it. Remember what you said? How she looked at you on Saturday like she was preparing to never see you again? - Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter? You're 100 percent sure?
Unfortunately, just as we arrived in France, so did the Kaiser and the entire German Army. I wanted to go home, but Hub said we should tour Europe one step ahead of the Germans. And we did. What a time that was. There were these girls in Toulon-- twins.
How about a little help here, okay? Now, look-- they say these two old men got millions stashed away in cash. Nobody knows where they got it. Got no kids, no one to leave all that money to. You and me, we're as close as any family they got.
What a time that was. There were these girls in Toulon-- twins. And they anyway, we eventually wound up in Marseilles with passage booked on the last ship out of Europe. And Hub, he decided that we should spend our last night enjoying the local nightlife. Three, three!
Take the other end. Here we go. If you two old ladies want to get in, I'll take you home now. Hub! Psst! Psst! You're with those McCann brothers?
Here we go. If you two old ladies want to get in, I'll take you home now. Hub! Psst! Psst! You're with those McCann brothers? I know that they're ex-mafia hit men.
Amazing, unbelievable stories all about two brothers, Hub and Garth McCann, the most valiant and brave men, huh? He called them his "most honored adversaries." "The only men who ever outsmarted me." Wait, so you-- you knew these two men?
Wait, so you-- you knew these two men? They-- they raised me. It's an honor. - Nice to meet you. - lt's nice to meet you.
No, let go! Let's you and me get something straight. We can be friends or we can be enemies. I've had a run of crummy luck lately. I know some bad people who want to cause a lot of trouble for me.
- Then he should've been infected. - Maybe we're resistant. - That's possible, isn't it? - So is genetic flexibility. - What the hell's she talking about?
He'll call you back. Not all language is based on sound. We communicate in other ways... that are much less overt than the spoken word. So do animals. The only difference between them and us can be summarized in one word: novelty.
- Anything's possible. - I think Julian's right. - It looks extraterrestrial. - You're all talking nonsense. No offense, Nyla.
You're a very unpleasant individual, you know that? You think they're dead? What am I, psychic? I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off. No, Harvey.
You think bringing this Gato will do all that? No, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money selling it brings will do just that. We can buy seed, irrigate. Farm our own lands. Free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.
- That's all, paint job! - I'm real! Die, bots, die! Banished from humanity, the machines sought refuge in their own promised land. They settled in the cradle of human civilization and thus a new nation was born. A place the machines could call home.

Where's Linda? It's Lori. This is her house, so don't be a total cocksmith. Whatever. Where are the ladies?

You tear me down to make yourself feel better... because you really hate yourself... which is kind of pathetic when you actually... stop and think about it, assuming, of course... you can think with all that makeup... weighing down your head. The cops said Blake committed suicide. Apparently, it was grief over Trey. No, man, that's bullshit. I heard some guy Krueger killed them both.
Hey, Mark. You didn't forget about me, did you? Oh, God. Oh, that's right! Everyone forgot!
And never keep your keys in the door. Great, so now we're completely fucked. No, you're not. I'm here to help you. Now, this Jason Voorhees supposedly drowned... at Camp Crystal Lake back in 1957... when he was eleven years old.
One day, when you least expect it, you'll be washing dishes... you'll be rinsing out a glass... and you'll be thinking about nothing special...of me, just a little bit. And I'll be in my house... I'll be thinking of you. I'll think of how much I love you... And then, my cock will start to grow, and grow, and grow.
-Wanna go? -Yeah. Happiness is a balloon. The balloon is in my head. It blows up, it blows up.
-This isn't a joke? -No, it was his bedroom. This bed was made expressly for him, it went wherever he did. It's 2 meters in length, I believe. Yeah, it really is a big bed.
And I saw God. He was wearing a flannel shirt and a Budweiser hat. He held me and said, 'It's not yet your time. Go back.'" One cool thing about doing this tour is we've been everywhere in the country. Traveling is never a lot of fun, but since 9/1 1 it's so much more difficult.
You're almost required to say, "How did that happen? " They were happy to share the whole tale. The brother and his buddy were driving down the road and a beaver ran across the street. They accidentally hit it. Then the beaver went down into the ditch on the side of the road.
They were happy to share the whole tale. The brother and his buddy were driving down the road and a beaver ran across the street. They accidentally hit it.

-New York. All right, New York. I got thrown out of a bar in New York City. When I say I got thrown out of a bar I don't mean somebody asked me to leave and we walked to the door together and I said, "Bye, everybody, I gotta go." Six bouncers hurled me out of a nightclub like I was a Frisbee.
This is beautiful. Look at this. You might be a redneck if you've ever slept in the Waffle House. I'd like to go on the record and say I don't think any of this is funny. The director of this film is easily amused.
She's already feeling bad about her moles and then the night before, she got this horse and it busted its leg and I had to shoot it. And now it's got a broken leg and a gunshot wound.

Cold water, quick! Coming, stop shouting. I didn't do it on purpose. You never do anything on purpose! Come here straight away!
It could be the last movie he saw or book he read in the eighth grade. The mind is an unpredictable machine. There's absolutely nothing.... suspicious in that transaction. Yeah, well. Somethin' will rear its ugly head sooner or later. Memory loss is a tricky thing.
- You're kidding? Big Bazookas? - I saw her looking at it. - God, I bet she went off her head. My mum did when she found me Rubb4r Hous4wiv4s. It's a difficult age.
Me too! I'm in the bath! And the bubbles, they're Christian Dior. The bath bubbles! They're Christian Dior!
When you're standing in a cardboard street talking about meeting George Clooney. What's with all these letters? All this bloody Florence Nightingale, this agony aunt? Doesn't that smack just a little bit of being a star? Loads of people lose their partners to this disease.
"Every stage of their growth has its own beauty, but the last phase is always the most glorious." "Then very quickly they all go to seed." "Which makes it ironic my favourite flower isn't even indigenous to the British Isles, let alone Yorkshire." "l don't think there's anything on this planet that more trumpets life than the sunflower." "For me, that's because of the reason behind its name."
Wine, books, music, women. Above all, women. Their smell, their mouths, the feel of their skin. -Were there many of them? -Yes.

If not I'll call the police. This is so good... How was your day? Fine. Alfredo, your feet stink.
As the years went by, I learnt to stop sharing this with people They said I was dreaming But back then, I believed it whole heartily So whenever I was down, I would just escape into my mind To my other live, where I was someone else It made me happy to think that all these people... just didn't know yet who I was gonna be

Cause it was me It was only me And I'll tell them that, ok But it's over for me now I'm never gonna see you again That people could forgive you for something like this, you know?
And so they're really free to let their fantasies fly. I think the most overwhelming thing was the enormous amount of child pornography. You would just have to walk into the living room, and it'd be piled around the piano. There were literally foot-high stacks of pornography, in plain view, all around the house. But photos taken during the search showed nothing of the kind.
And he was saying something to me. And then one of the TV cameras came over, so we kind of ran to the backyard. And we went behind the house. And we were in the backyard of our house. And the cops came back, and they said, "What's going on here?" And I said, "Don't worry about it. It's just me and Jesse. "
But when the bail was set at a million dollars, instead of going out with Mom and David like we were supposed to, we went back the other way. And that was the moment when there was this whole new sense that the problem was much worse than I originally thought. The investigation didn't end at that point. That really was the arrest and the search of the house. And then we went on, because we had literally, at that point dozens more interviews to do.
Not guilty. And Jesse Friedman, how do you plead to this indictment? Not guilty. My brother and Jesse kept saying they're innocent. "This is trumped up charges. "
My brother and Jesse kept saying they're innocent. "This is trumped up charges. " And they got a McMartin's, you know? They somehow got one kid to, they got the police to be able to convince the kids, "Well, all of your friends said something happened. Didn't something happen? Something must have happened," et cetera, et cetera.
So Arnold's mother had these two boys, and they were really on welfare. I don't know. They lived in a basement apartment. Evidently, there was one bedroom, and the boys slept in the bedroom with the mother. We shared, all 3 of us, not in the same bed, but we all shared the same room, big rooms. And rather than put a, apparently the living room was the living room, and then there was the kitchen, so we put all the beds in the one room.
She doesn't want She doesn't want any record, any record at all As if they were Can you believe these kids, that they have to persecute me? David, if your mother doesn't want to be filmed don't film her. - OK. - Come on.
Week after week, month after month year after year until after the police came knocking on doors and asking questions. I went to the doorbell. There were two Nassau County detectives and they said they'd like to speak to our son with regard to the Friedman matter. They came in and said, "We know something happened to him. " They didn't say, "We believe. " They said, "We know. "

I remember it was actually kind of a frightening experience because I remember they're talking to my parents about this within earshot of me.
I mean he's about to go to jail for the next 6 to 18 years and he's out on the courtroom steps in some sort of theatrical performance. That is so funny, when they're all I think it was about distracting ourselves not necessarily distracting Jesse. I think he was the most comfortable about the whole situation. You know I don't know how he has always been the most comfortable about it, but he has.

You know I don't know how he has always been the most comfortable about it, but he has. OK, right about now we've been waiting for a good two hours or so now because evidently the parents stormed Denis Dillon's office this morning when they received the news last night that I was to plead guilty

OK, right about now we've been waiting for a good two hours or so now because evidently the parents stormed Denis Dillon's office this morning when they received the news last night that I was to plead guilty and they were not aware of this fact.

I'll ask you again. Who gave you the information? When I was a child, I went with him to the park. I begged a photographer to take my picture with him. Then he consoled me and said,

He was proud of what he did and does not feel sorry. I just want to say, judge, that I have a great deal of remorse. As far as I want you to treat me different, I don't want that.

If you go to page 25 of the paper i sent you last week, you'll find a photo of tsiolkovsky visiting the eiffel tower in paris. Tsiolkovsky had conceived a structure... tall enough to exceed the stratosphere, and reach into space. This structure had a small elevator to carry people to an observation deck located at the top. He called this "the space castle." So, we clearly see the influence of fairy tales on his engineering. The only thing hindering construction of such a structure, is that there exists no material strong enough to support its weight.

Have you thought? I woke with my mind raging. I went back to the gallery where my reasoning revealed something so incredible to me that I can't stand without it. It's mathematically possible, so why not humanly too? But in that case, the whole business is huge.

Well, fuck it. It's only one night. "And further on a group of Grecian girls... the first and tallest her white kerchief waving... were strung together like a row of pearls... linked hand in hand and dancing, each too having down her white neck... long floating auburn curls, the least of which would set ten poets raving... their leader sang and bounded to her song, with choral step and voice... the virgin throng." All these romantics go on about is love, love, love. Well, you know what? They were lucky, they all died young. In poetically tragic circumstances, of course.
Whatever time you arrive, you cause a sensation. Make them beg. Let them twirl, let them howl. Let them melt their fat in the dust of their offices, let the liqueurs spill over the caryatids in palace corridors.

This is Bouth Heng's answer, leader of the interrogation group at Bureau S21. "My Acts of Sabotage: "To interrogate women in striking them so their clothes fell down, "burn their buttocks until they had gangrene, "to make them lose their heads
And you didn't go willingly. But people can't see that. You must tell the truth. Whether it was 100, 200, it doesn't matter who killed who. You killed.
The Khmer said: "Bones cry, flesh calls out." There will be bad Karma. What do you think? If we killed people... and if I killed as well... of our own free will, this would be evil.
They tortured me at Battambang, almost to death, but once I was here, they didn't interrogate me anymore. The people that you denounced, did you see them brought here? I never saw them, neither arrested, nor brought here. I was detained here for only two months, before the fall of Phnom Penh. Those that I denounced, I never saw them here.
I never saw them, neither arrested, nor brought here. I was detained here for only two months, before the fall of Phnom Penh. Those that I denounced, I never saw them here. That's why... every day, I think about them, I pray to the gods, that if I denounced them, if they endured the consequences, to not inflict bad karma on me. Day after day, these feelings remain in my heart.

That's why... every day, I think about them, I pray to the gods, that if I denounced them, if they endured the consequences, to not inflict bad karma on me. Day after day, these feelings remain in my heart. If you think about it, they arrested your leader, he must have given 50, 60 names, including yours.
- Under the authority of S21? - Yes, 600. If you were victims, what were the executed prisoners? I mean... There were a lot of my men.
You took them secretly and put them in your mouth. If the guard surprised us, he came in. With his shoe, he knocked us on the ears, three, four times on each side. You almost lost consciousness. The cricket would jump out of your mouth.
In the beginning, I was educated, to reinforce... my ideological position. S21 was the heart of the nation, its wall of containment. We were the right hand of the Party, we had to have a resolute position. Faced with an enemy, we couldn't hesitate, we were determined before the enemy, even if he was your brother, your father, your mother. If he was here, you distinguished your friends from your enemies, you didn't hesitate.
The Party, S21, never made a mistake. They were our enemies. Your capacity to reflect as a man, was lost. You no longer recognised father or mother. You couldn't believe your parents?
I considered him an animal. When I raised my hand, my heart didn't stop my head, it didn't keep my hand or my foot from striking him. The heart and the hand worked together. That was torture. We knew that the detainees who arrived at Bureau S21 were going to die.
At this moment, at S21, there was no female staff. We were only boys, we were between 13 and 14 years old and 22 and 23 years old. We were at the height of our youth, we were overflowing with sexual urges. They didn't let us go home, we didn't go anywhere, we were stuck here. When we saw new detainees arriving, We joyfully gathered to see them.

And this. The detainees were entrusted to the doctors. "Extermination for the taking of blood." Did you know about it? The taking of blood that I've seen...
You know that. I just feel we're rushing things a little bit. Maybe it's a little early for spare keys and all that "moving in together" stuff. It just seems like a lot of responsibility, with keys and... What do you think? OK.

Nothing new. Where're you going? To look for bread. What did people at work say? Everyone's talking about us.
My party is truly populist, it's a very large group composed mostly of everyday folk: blue collar workers, peasants, employees. You speak of "people," yet we speak of "classes"... of class struggle, of class hatred. I don't have any hatred for you. And I don't believe that class struggle is the engine of history.
Your friends don't recognize you anymore. They don't recognize me anymore. Me neither, I don't recognize them. They think I've turned into someone else. That's the case, in fact.
Cheers to the new couple! - Oh yeah? People do a lot less than they could. It's a real waste of vital energy! If people gave it their all, the world would be different.

To go where? Know what I heard? That in the next village there are lots of beautiful girls. And they're fair-skinned and sexy. But look at our girls! All burnt by the sun.
How? Don't they have foreign bows? Yes, they do, but they also have TV. So most of their kids spend all their time watching cricket. What's cricket?
You know, smoking... destroys your health and makes your air like a blind horse... and then, slowly makes your mind... like a handicapped rider. Hey! Stop preaching. No one's here to listen to your sermon. I'm upset enough already. Stop irritating me. Come on, don't get mad. I was just teasing.
I had enough points. Really? So why? I want to help my father. My mother's dead and he's all alone.
I was thinking about the apple man. Why? Do you miss him? Yes. Do you always miss people you've just met?
Travel safely, both of you. Stay well. Don't tell me you're changing your mind. Don't be sad. You know... a peach blossom is beautiful.
I mean there's goons there's spies the military police so you do everything in a clandestine manner. We are about to start the meeting, and in walk three guys very tough looking guys. The company had found out about our meeting and sent these spies. Obviously we didn't have the meeting. But these young girls were really bright.
This is the reality. It's the science of exploitation. [Personality Diagnostic Checklist World Health Organization Manual of Mental Disorders] [Callous unconcern for the feelings of others] What happens in the areas where these corporations go in and are successful?
They're not out for profit. They may purposely run at a loss because of the side benefits. So for example if a public steel industry runs at a loss it's providing cheap steel to other industries. Maybe that's a good thing. Public institutions can have a counter cyclic property.
It's true for churches, for schools, for any institution that has power over people and shapes them. The corporation likewise. It provides us with a list of virtues, a kind of social role, which is the good consumer. Like the waters of the mighty ocean people also represent tremendous force. The understanding of which is the greatest importance to the American way of life. This force is known as consumer power.
Dad what do you do and why is it important? [Past client: Phillip Morris] My answer to that question is basically [Orgainzed the National Smoers Allience to fight against anti-smoking laws] that I help corporations have a voice. [Orgainzed the National Smoers Allience to fight against anti-smoking laws] [Past client: Canadian forestry corporations Created the British Columbia Fores Allience to combat environmental campaigns] And I help corporations share the point of view about how they feel about things. [Results that change the way we live]
Well it's sad. I mean I think that it's too bad, that this has this has erupted. [Democracy LTD] Does the ranted to be some measure of accountability? Yes. And I think the business community recognizes that. But that accountability is in the marketplace, it's with their shareholders. It's with the public perception and the public image that they are projecting.
What kind of person is the corporation? Corporations were given the rights of immortal persons. But then special kinds of persons, persons who had no moral conscience. These are a special kind of persons which are designed by law to be concerned only for their stockholders. And not say what are sometimes called their stakeholders like the community or the work force or whatever.

These are a special kind of persons which are designed by law to be concerned only for their stockholders. And not say what are sometimes called their stakeholders like the community or the work force or whatever. The great problems of having corporate citizens is that they aren't like the rest of us.
And what's that another way of saying, well the people are no longer desperate. So okay we've used up all the desperate people there they're all plump and healthy and wealthy. Let's move on to the next desperate lot and employ them and raise their level up. [Incapacity of maintain enduring relationships] Well the whole idea of the export processing zone is that it will be the first step towards this wonderful new development, through the investment that's attracted to these countries there will be a trickle down effect into the communities.
I knew not one constituent of the paper mills wanted to have the river polluted. And yet here the river was being polluted. And it was more or less as if we created a doom machine. In our search for wealth and for prosperity we created something that's going to destroy us. The traders who are involved in the market are not guys who are whose moral fibre when it comes to environmental conditions are going to be rattled at all.
I mean I virtually have worked for like I'd say 25% of the fortune 500. I've posed as an investment banker. I've posed as a venture capitalist. I've set up front companies that are executive recruiting firms. Essentially I'm a spy. I'll locate your employees and I will tell them that I'm calling from Acme Recruiting Agency and that I've got a job that pays them considerably more than what they're paying.
It's you know, what I mean you have to expect that guys like me are out there. We're predators. It's about competition it's about market share it's about being aggressive and it's about shareholder value. What is your stock at today? If you're a CEO, I mean, do you think your shareholders really care whether you're Billie Buttercup or not?
You have to develop what are called, created wants. So you have to create wants. You have to pose on people what's called a philosophy of futility. You have to focus them on the insignificant things of life like fashionable consumption. I'm just basically quoting business literature. And it makes perfect sense. The ideal is to have individuals who are totally disassociated from one another. Who's conception of themselves, the sense of value is just how many created wants can I satisfy? [General Motors Public Relations Film]
It's much safer for our community partners. I'll press the other button just to be sure... Well stalk over and talk to him personally. It's tough, you know, they're putting some taxpayer shareholder money into helping and who can say? But that money should be going to the taxpayers to decide what to do.
And you notice there's a bunch of boxes at his feet from some on line or mail order retailer. And there's a bunch of boxes there with of course big brand message on it. You walk out, and wonder, a lot of people must be ordering from that company. Well, what you don't know is that we paid the doorman to keep those empty boxes there. You walk out into the street, and you hear some people having kind of a loud conversation about a musical act.
And there's a bunch of boxes there with of course big brand message on it. You walk out, and wonder, a lot of people must be ordering from that company. Well, what you don't know is that we paid the doorman to keep those empty boxes there. You walk out into the street, and you hear some people having kind of a loud conversation about a musical act. And, they are passing headphones back and forth and "Wow, this is great!".
You're firing us because we refused to put on the air something that we knew and demonstrated to be false and misleading. That's what this is about. And because we put up a fight, because we stood up to this big corporation, and we stood up to your editors, and we stood up to your lawyers. And we said to you, look there ought to be a principle higher than just making money. And she wrote a letter back and said you are right that's exactly what it was. You stood up to us on this story and that's why we're letting you go. Big mistake. Big mistake.
A Congressional Committee ultimately found evidence of a plot to overthrow Roosevelt. According to Butler the conspiracy included representatives of some of Americas top corporations including J. P. Morgan, Dupont, and Goodyear tire. As today's chairman of Goodyear knows for corporations to dominate government a coup is no longer necessary. Corporations have gone global and by going global the governments have lost some control over corporations regardless of whether the corporation can be trusted or can not be trusted governments today do not have over the corporations the power that they had, and the leverage they had, 50 or 60 years ago.
Does the ranted to be some measure of accountability? Yes. And I think the business community recognizes that. But that accountability is in the marketplace, it's with their shareholders. It's with the public perception and the public image that they are projecting. If companies don't do what they should be doing they're going to be punished in the marketplace and that's not what any company wants. There's a new market.
That tome is the most exciting thing. That is happening. It's happening all over the world now. At the climax of the strugle, the army stayed in their barracks; the police also remained in the stations; the members of Congress become invisible; the Governor went into hiding; and afterwards, he resigned. There wasm't any authority left. The only legitimate authority was the people gathered at the city square making decisions in large assemblies.
And I don't believe we're there yet. [Psycho Therapies] And I think it's really important that we don't overstate the case and that we admit that there are cracks and fissures in all of these corporate structures. And sometimes when a corporation is concentrating on one particular project they look the other way and all kinds of interesting things happen in the corner. It is the case in every period of history where injustice based on falsehoods, based on taking away the right and freedoms of people to live and survive with dignity that eventually when you call a bluff the tables turn. Ultimately capital puts its foot down somewhere.
It's quite true that weeks and sometimes months would go by when he didn't have the inspiration, and everybody sat around the studio and he would or wouldn't come in, but nothing would happen. That happened very badly before he started on The Kid, for instance. Mildred Harris sued Chaplin for divorce in 1920. Her attorneys threatened to attach his negative. Chaplin fled to Salt Lake City to finish editing The Kid.
Chaplin was visibly so moved by this reaction that he felt that he has to reward the audience somehow. So he's looking around and suddenly he sees Monsieur Duhamel next to him with a cane. So he grabs his cane and does few steps. But in that moment, Monsieur Duhamel, being stripped of the cane starts to St. Vitus Dance because he couldn't-- Now, Chaplin sees it, and he just- - They just clasp each other like that, embrace, just to keep standing. People in the audience who knew about Monsieur Duhamel's condition were petrified.
Comedy transposition, the idea of one thing suggests another was not unique to Chaplin, but it was one of his great gifts. The Pawnshop is a great example of that where, as a pawnbroker's assistant he's asked to look at an alarm clock. And of course, in his hands he becomes the doctor and the clock becomes his patient. Late, middle, early Chaplin, his gift for transforming one object into another remained central to his comic genius. These transformations deliberate manipulations of our perceptions of the real were also central to modernity with its fluid, ever-changing definitions of what constitutes reality. This idea of transformation goes back right to the start.
Limelight was not Chaplin 's first filmed evocation of his music-hall past. In 1915, he re-created his great Karno success, Mumming Birds, on film. For the movie, he invented a second character for himself to play a tipsy, touchy citizen of the balcony quick to register his displeasure with the performance. If he feared the audience's indifference, he equally feared its volatility which this figure personified. The music-hall audience was a tough one.
Chaplin began production of Shoulder Arms while the First World War was being fought. And many in the Hollywood community were persuading him not to do it. But Chaplin went on with it, trusting his own artistic instincts. But he had doubts. He was unsure of the result. But when the film was released, it was a huge hit. It was one of the most popular films of the entire First World War period. The picture was released just weeks before the armistice so it didn't do much for morale.

Why didn't you remain a doctor? You could still be a doctor and give advice to women. - What advice would I give them? - Whatever they happen to need. Even the easy girls who worked the nights in the barracks... and then came to you to empty their wombs.
"No one's coming here anymore. We have been abandoned" "Let the fish live in the lighthouse. At least we'll have some company" And she climbed up to the tower with the fish like a sleepwalker. Father told me to go after her or she might fall down, the fish in tow. I couldn't go because the tower was full of fish and I fell down... and then a big slimy one came and crawled between my legs. I screamed "Father, help!"... but the thing, that fish, kept crawling.

Bottom gear start reduces the vehicle depreciation. If you're on the same row with an 'enemy', waiting for the green light to hunt for the passenger, you have to use second gear. Hunt for passengers... No hunt, no passengers, right? That's true.

Again? The tale of Nang Takian is not a legend... That's because it was told by many people with all different versions... and besides, no one knows where the real location of The Takian tree.

- I can barely hear you. It's a bad connection. - I want you to bring Wallace back here now. - Wallace is dead. But I got the evidence. It's a memory chip containing the original source recordings.
There's a hostile US paramilitary unit standing between you and the bomb. A Coral Snake team headed up by Colonel Ron Samuels. It's the same unit that took out our plane. What is going on? Why is a US military unit aiding these terrorists? As far as we know, they're not.
All six members of the team had been killed before Bauer got there. What about the bomb? Roger, your men are all dead, and there's no sign of the bomb. That's not possible. Your insane plan backfired.
The FAA has got it spotted in hangar M as in "mama", D as in "delta", seven. OK. We got it. Let's go. Hangar MD7 at the other end of the airport. The third hangar from the end.
For weeks? Why would he withhold that from you? He wanted to wait until the bomb was on US soil before he intercepted it. - So he knows where the bomb is. - The men he had tracking it did.
It could've backfired and landed Sherry and me in prison. We didn't want this to touch you if that happened. OK, let's say I accept that. What proof do you have that exonerates Sherry? I have photographs, taped conversations, debriefs, files filled with the work Sherry did.
They're a rogue unit, acting on their own authority. - How do I find them? - Somewhere at the airport. Our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb. There is a nuclear warhead somewhere on-site.
They may see the camera move. We don't have a choice. Do it. There they are. We got to get in there before they start killing everyone. Come on! Come on! Faster!

He's a mathematecian working out of Cal Tech. The bureau just confirmed that he and his family were kidnapped from the Long Beach Aquarium yesterday. Parking lot surveillance cameras recorded this. Doubtful he's acting alone. I assume his partnership with Sloane is alive and well.
What did Sloane want with a wetware expert? All Alliance members were injected with a tracking device. Sloane must've hired Gendler to deactivate his so he could disappear. Right. But there's more.
The magnetometer you're developing for the Swiss polytechnic. - How do you know about that? - I know about a lot of things. You're asking me to do something I cannot do. The magnetometer was designed to measure magnetic fields in space.

It was the only thing I could do to save Michael's life. Really? You cannot think that I would have chosen to hurt him, ever. Michael might never wake up from this. At 4.30 GMT, an imaging satellite picked up the heat signature of a small aircraft flying a tactical profile.
Kingsley was en route to Avignon to deliver the schematics. They were stolen. And this drone could be converted into a delivery system. Biological weapons, chemical. I get it. This group, we know almost nothing about them. They refer to themselves as "The Covenant".

Looks like he wasn't alone. No, you're right. He had four other friends with him, including Timmy. And here you go. It's a classic distraction technique. Did it many times. You go in with a group of buddies and you cause a little ruckus. Store owner gets flustered.
No. The cleaning crew's in the theater now. They got a late start 'cause of you guys. Excuse me. What happened to the garbage that was in the can in the lobby?
I think an aneurysm in my sleep-- quick and painless. I like surprises. Look at that. Current went through the phone. From what? Heat lightning.
This about it? Yeah. Okay ... now, electricity is fickle, right? One centimeter can mean the difference between a little zap and dead. So, let's assume that the current went out through his right index finger and the phone.
Bye. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Yes, did you make any progress in Victor's death? We're actually here to talk about your car. Oh, you found it? Tell me it's not stripped.
Look, I didn't want him dead, just off the team. You got your wish. I need your racing shoes. No way. / I have a warrant. Look, you wouldn't take Michael jordan's lucky shorts the day before a game.
Only way is to do it before the race. Cart scrutineers hand out pop-off valves... / what'd you say? Scrutineers. That's what cart calls their tech inspectors. Well, they might. you shouldn't.
Just savoring the moment. Yeah, I know what you mean. These jam cars are the most sophisticated vehicles you'll see besides the space shuttle. I didn't know you were a race fan. Oh, I'm not.
He was going to report you. Then your career would have been over. So it was time for him to go. So, you treated his gloves. then doused a little sulfuric acid on qualifying day.
No. No evidence of rape. What are her chances realistically? Swolen on her brain goes down, she might be okay. I told her she'd pull through.
Firstly, congratulations. Cool potion. - Thank you. - Secondly, it will never work. Okay, even if it does, it's not something you should be going at alone.
It's the only damn reason I went through all of this. Went through all what? I think we should report this. So you say the club is still pretty successful in this alleged other reality of yours. It's not alleged, it's real.
Eventually we always have to come back and deal with the real world. So what? What are you gonna do? You'll just sit here for your entire life waiting for the world to come to you? Because the point of those stories, Joey, is that people's lives their real lives, only begin when they step out into the world. And when you do that, when you meet it head-on maybe you change the world, maybe you don't but the point is, is that it changes you.
Bye-bye. So there is a soul in there somewhere. And to think I just assumed you were another one of Rich Rinaldi's pet sharks. Sadia, I just screwed over my best friend. I've felt sick to my stomach all day.
-Like what? How about when you drove through the house and almost killed us? He's right about the car, yeah. There were some things that I did that I probably wouldn't have if I weren't drinking. What other things, Pinkie?
I'm not looking for love right now. When I find it, it usually kicks my ass. If, at some point, some Christian Bale type descends upon me. -So to speak. -Yeah. Well, I'm gonna have to have a little bit of private time with that Christian Bale type before I can let you marry him. You know, actually I would be the perfect husband.
-What's all that? -Extra work. Did you think your little mini-vacation would have no consequences? I told you I was sick. Yeah, well, I don't get sick myself. And you know what kills me about people who do? -What's that?
Like you would have any idea. Any time you want to quit and go back to the easy life be my guest, but as long as you work here the only lunches you're gonna be going to are the ones you cater in your mind. So this is what it's like when you're actually working, huh? I thought the phones would ring a little more. No, it doesn't really work like that.

I was hoping you could be Fiona's mentor. Get her up to speed. - Mentor? - Mentor. Mentor. A promotion without a pay raise. Basically, all you do is peel off these edges so that they fit neatly in the box.
Sure, I lost plenty of teeth and, sure, I stuck them under my pillow expecting a cool reward like cash or candy. But my mom thought cash and candy were crass, so tooth after tooth was instead rewarded with a thoughtful note meant to inspire. This sucks. At the time I thought it was a total rip-off. Like I said, it's the little things you regret.
I'm OK. But you see something that screams me, pick it up. - Heard about the big dust cloud? - What dust cloud? Five miles wide, two miles high. Boating over China, wiping out everything in its path.
I'm so glad we are finally able to do this. I can't tell you how long I've been wanting to cook for you. - Frying pan? Big one. - Down there. Your house is amazing.
Greg Stillson is coming to Washington. - You're giving up your life for this. - This has a high priority. So... what did you think? I know these people. They're my neighbors.
Johnny: On a smaller scale, that's what it felt like. Except one guy. He had a gun. He was probably protecting his family. They were all women and children.
And then that's what all those excuses became. And every time I try to remember them, all I can see is this... one face. You're the first person I've talked to about any of this outside the unit. My wife still thinks that I deserve that Bronze Star. My own son is in harm's way right now, because he had to follow in his father's heroic footsteps.
- Aren't they endangered? - That's right, JJ! Everything in this forest is interconnected. If the owls weren't here to feed on the small animals, this whole habitat could be damaged. Whatcha looking for?
- That's right, JJ! Everything in this forest is interconnected. If the owls weren't here to feed on the small animals, this whole habitat could be damaged. Whatcha looking for? You see, owls are predators, they eat small mammals like mice.

I assume he's tracing the call but since I'm forwarding through a phone bank, I imagine we have a little time to talk. I think it's just swell that you and Walt and Sarah can be such good friends. And they even named their boy after you, huh? It is their boy... isn't it, Johnny? Because I've always sort of wondered about that.
let's hear it. Okay, um... I think that this routine will play well for a couple of months. But then you better come up with something to really hang your hat on. I know these people, they're my neighbors. They will cheer for apple pie and the American flag in your speeches.
It's for you. John Smith. So... what do you think of the house? I know it's yours. Yeah... can you believe what those people are doing to my house?
- No. - Yeah, with Harms. The paramedic? It's my own fault. You're forgetting the number-one rule of dating: men are scum.
The paramedic? It's my own fault. You're forgetting the number-one rule of dating: men are scum. And women don't know what the hell they want. Am I right? I'm right, right?
You're forgetting the number-one rule of dating: men are scum. And women don't know what the hell they want. Am I right? I'm right, right? They want commitment until you give it. Then, they want freedom. Naturally, you oblige.
- When you get a chance. - Thanks. You know, younger men have a lot of energy. Not when they have cancer. Oh, sorry.
- Look what the patient fairy brought you. - No. Mrs. Hawkes, 44, fever, cough times three days. - I'm juggling 10 patients already. - I'm just waiting for a chest film.
- Carter. I wanna see this Carter guy. - He doesn't work here anymore. - Come on! - Here's what we're gonna do. I'll fix you up with a nurse, something to eat and a bath.
Why? - I'm not talking to you. You cannot just wander off without telling me where you're going. Did you eat all this? - Where did you get the money? - He bought it for me.
You guys keep burning down hospitals. Where you gonna go when you get shot? Where are you gonna go when your mothers get sick? Dr. John! He says many people died here. They took the bodies to Kasese.
In his current condition, I doubt he'd recognize any of us. Any idea what caused this? A mutagenic virus. His blood was swarming with them. It was apparently designed to rewrite the DNA of its host. To transform any humanoid it infects into another species.
As I suspected, it's nothing more than a simple headache. I was hoping for something more serious. I've been coerced into watching tonight's movie. If you're looking for a medical excuse, you're out of luck. If it's any consolation, I'll be there, too.
You're working with someone named Degra. Who is he? That's none of your concern. What's he using it for? Kemocite can be used for any number of purposes.
I've rigged up four of Malcolm's forcefield emitters. They'll contain any blast debris. What about radiation and particle disbursement? We know nothing about this device. That's the point.
The people on this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet. I'll be damned if I'm going to make them pay for it. You offered to help us. Are you still willing? If you're prepared to trust me.
Well, they appear to be generating synaptic impulses. Is it alive? Wouldn't make a very good pet but, uh... definitely organic. And it seems to have reproductive capabilities. The kemocite is extremely refined.
- What if they expel him? - Colin's like Teflon. They can't touch him. We could get the doctors to say they can't expel him that he needs the structure. They know there's no way he'd do something like that. - I don't know.
How could he write this? Right or wrong it's always easier to believe in what isn't there. Rockwell himself put it pretty well. He said, "The view of life I communicate in my pictures excludes the sordid and the ugly. " He said:
Yeah, kind of, but he transferred. Oh, so it's a "he," is it? Oh, it's nothing like that. His family's kind of messed up, and he was going to spend Thanksgiving all alone. And I told him that your cranberry sauce is the most amazing thing.
Sometimes it's hard to remember that just a few short months ago... Well, what you have to understand is while cultures and civilizations... may vary wildly from socially primitive to hyper-mechanized, there is still a uniformity in the way that people conduct their lives. You're saying wherever you go in the Universe... we're all the same? Essentially, yes. In that way, Earth is no different from other planets.
Wow! Well, that's frelled. Who cares when you have it? My mom... Okay. So... why are all the little girls wearing all those clothes?
Alright, I'm done.You try! What'cha doin? - Making rat poison. - Gonna kill a few? On the contrary.
John... you are not going back to Earth! No, I'm not... It's complicated. We need to maintain clarity of thought, healthy skepticism, and aggressive inquisitiveness. To that end, we at this network... call upon the government to release all files pertaining to Officer Schelmacher's allegations of past visitation, and any other related matter.
No, I'm not... It's complicated. We need to maintain clarity of thought, healthy skepticism, and aggressive inquisitiveness. To that end, we at this network... call upon the government to release all files pertaining to Officer Schelmacher's allegations of past visitation, and any other related matter. When the aliens return... and they will... we also urge an aggressive quarantine... until the true nature of their presence is ascertained.
I can see it. - You can see the bubble? - Yes, can't you? I kinda smell it. Anyway... anyway, you know what I'm talkin about.
- Are you, uh... quite sure? - Um hum. What's in there? Services. Expensive... services.
What did you say to them? I told them that we saw... a Leviathan starburst a moment ago... that we were afraid it was going to board us and I thanked them for scaring it away. Homing device... Found in what's left of it's neural processor. That device confining Grayza was not meant to transport her.
Where'd I go just now? Hello, Fry. Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. And- - Oh, give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
Like canapés and cocktail parties and the people who plan them. - Mom, what are you talking about? - Nothing. It's not important. Mom, come on. Jason decided to take the clients to Atlantic City instead.
- Not bad. And how much would one have to pay for your culinary services? It depends, the type of food, number of people, kind of venue. Simple food, two guests, my mother's living room. Really?
Out of the blue, bam! It was right there. Well, things always happen when you least expect it. - I have to tell you, this tree is perfect. - All girls think their tree is perfect.
- Running water was not always historical. You're not seriously telling me I can't put in running water? Oh, my God, this is incredible. It's called chocolate chocolate chocolate, but it's seriously chocolate chocolate chocolaty. Sorry.
Don't say cool like that. It's gonna be very pleasant. I thought you said you were gonna go talk to Taylor. I own my own business now, Rory. I'm gonna have to deal with tiny men like Taylor all the time.
- Good, smart. Little concoction of mine - it'll help with the hangover. - Guess I had a beer or two too many last night, huh? - Yeah, it happens. - Hope the guys didn't bug you too much.
- We'll pay. - No. Grandma, it's going to be fun, really. Kids do this all the time. Yes, but you're not a kid, you're a grown woman. What are  <hon>people<hoff> going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?
- On the side. On the side of what? On the side of the burgers, on the side of the sandwiches, or on the side of the road where the ditch I'm gonna dump your body into is? - Just make sure there's enough for everyone. - Fine. - Aren't you gonna read it back? - Nope. Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor, which means if they aren't satisfied with their orders, they will send them back.
- I need you. - Rory. I need you, I need you here, I need you now. I cannot do this alone. I need my Mommy, and dammit, I don't care who knows it!
Mom, she's only staying with you for a few days. I have to buy her flowers. She doesn't like mine, they're too tall. It's ostentatious to have flowers that tall. Actually, I've been meaning to mention that to you myself. I have to get new guest towels. I have to get new highball glasses. I have to get four very specific types of cheese.
We'll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what's the situation? At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho. - The yarn store's on Peach. - Plum. That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate. There's a back road that circles around it, but it's gonna be muddy from the rains.
We're in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York. - No, it's not the same. - Exactly the same. I have nothing stylish enough. That's not true, you got the black cashmere coat.
Sir, we have the Washington MTAC on the VTC. Ten days ago, five million was sent from a Hawallah money broker in Toulon to a Hawallah in Tunis. Do we have any assets in Tunis, Director? Not at the moment. But our friends up the river do.
I need your ass out here. Alone? Bring whoever you need. Before we start, I want you to know I've advised my client against this interview. As you know, your cover was found near the scene of the crime.
Wrong! Guy gets nervous. Sets it up so another doctor at his practice a rival looks like the killer. He plants evidence, and it's a good idea, in theory. But the finger comes pointing back to him.
We have reason to believe the mother is a child. You were a huge supporter of the safe haven law. This is exactly the kind of person that law was intended to protect. The safe haven law was intended to protect the baby, not the Mother. We gave these women the opportunity to leave an infant, no questions asked, at any number of public places.
I don't mean the baby, I mean the mother. She lost a lot of blood. She's extremely vulnerable to infection, and that's only the physical fallout. He's right. The psychological damage alone-- now, we have the 911 call.
You mean you're trying to be popular. Same difference. Not exactly. Don't miss any more world history. You're just in time for the crusades.
I gotta go out. Why? Because I accidentally stole a CD and given the high moral tone of this family, I'm going to return it. How do you accidentally steal something? Ooh, you're in for it now, buddy.
Hi, Come back soon, ask for Barbie. If you're Barbie, I'll do that. You're funny. I'm starting to like the vehicle. This is why people hate mimes.
You know, some people believe microwaves suck all the energy out of food. Hello, Joan to God! Hello. In fact, microwaves emanate. What? Microwaves actually energies food in the form... of molecular kinetic vibrations, A.K. A heat. It was a simple driving test. What's the big delay?
Batman and I will follow some leads, but I just don't know if it'll be enough. So a psychic sweep. Of the whole city. Is it possible? I've never tried anything like that before.
Scary, huh? Sounds like whoever made it had you in mind. Yeah. It even acted like me. Now, that's scary.
What the hell am I thinking about? You got it under control. I don't know what's the matter with me. DANNY: Slots 26 left, guy in the striped shirt. All right, fellows, move in.
The boss isn't gone five minutes, he's already gone mad. What, that I'm an efficient chief of security means... BOTH: Acting chief. SAM: Mr. And Mrs. James Warner of Chicago... dropped $1.2 million in three days in Sun City... and $1.5 million, two weeks later in Monte Carlo. Some serious players.
SURVEILLANCE MAN: Long time. Did you run the look-alike scenario through Griffin? And Metro. Cops never heard of anything like it either. These guys were pros, man.
- I take this place as seriously as he does... which is why, after five years, he finally decided to take a vacation... and leave me in charge. You do look awfully sexy behind this desk. - Boss. - Yeah, my God. NESSA: Is it me, or is it really hot in here?
He's not coming up. Go out there. Watch this. [Cheering and applauding continues] ARDEN: Long live Camelot! Sen. Bill Henderson, the nation's self-appointed... defender of virtues and morals, was caught last night... with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar.
The feds will get Zapata for killing Donovan. But what about Livia Sandoval? She dies without any justice and we're supposed to be happy about it? We tell ourselves that we speak for the victims, but we don't. We can close cases.
Petrovsky will subpoena the DEA agent, the warrant will stand, and Zapata will go away for 25 to life. That easy, huh? Everyone understands the sensitive nature of the DEA investigation. Petrovsky has no reason to jeopardize that. All efforts will be made to maintain the witness's confidentiality.
Let's go, Joe. (Dr. Petrus) Serotonin is one of the brain's chemical messengers. It governs our moods. If it's reabsorbed into the brain too quickly, people can have feelings of depression, worthlessness, fatigue. And reuptake inhibitors such as Aptril can block this reabsorption?
Aptril, like some kind of gift from God. I gave it to him. I thought, you know, it would make him better. No one will know, and everything's gonna be okay. The pharmacy that sent Sandra the Aptril says it was legitimate.
Where did you get that? (Alex) This approves of giving doctors off-patent meds free of charge in exchange for patient lists. Is that your signature? I don't have to listen to this. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll resume later.
(Stabler) Yeah, he could be telling the truth. It would have taken half an hour for George to get out that window. So how'd he get out? Detectives, we've got ourselves a puzzle. Fire a gun in here, ricochet heaven.
It would have taken half an hour for George to get out that window. So how'd he get out? Detectives, we've got ourselves a puzzle. Fire a gun in here, ricochet heaven. If we trace the bullet backwards, it ended up at the base of the wall.
I can't stop you from acting on instinct. Santa Fe, New Mexico, or Estacada, Oregon. It's about 30 miles southeast of Portland, a one-zip-code town. Thank you. Can I give you a lift to the airport? No, I'll get a cab.
I show up, and there's broken glass everywhere. He's not talking. What gives? He's been lying to me since day one. What are you talking about?
What gives? He's been lying to me since day one. What are you talking about? The "God is Nowhere" people, they've all dreamed about me in detail. Real things.
Because Paul is on a spiritual journey, this is something few of us undertake, and as in Paul's case, it is not that one chooses, rather, one is chosen. Well, that's very pretty. Why did you lie? Evie, I'm sure you've read reports claiming that violent crime on a worldwide basis is dropping. But the actual level of random violence in the world is rising dramatically child abduction by strangers, sniper attacks, suicide bombings. Many, if not all of those people, claim to do their work at the request of a higher being.

He for you also. And now short pause. / the continuation of programme "To / blank space" after messages. lattices casts Wide. the Violent decease, pain in head or the thorax, then some 90% of such deceases.

He was in there, in his private gym. Yeah, yeah. We heard about it on the news. They said he had a heart attack. That's what they thought at first. But they did an autopsy, and it wasn't a heart attack.
-Come on, Liz. You're getting that paid vacation you've been begging for. I don't want a vacation. I wanna rip the skin off of that tattooed piece of shit... and use it as wallpaper. You wouldn't be sending me away if I was a man.
Something about the contraction of my orgasm. And apparently semen is gonna make the-- I've been informed. I really do need you, Christian. You know, your dick started this mess.
-Well, it's a bad idea, Henry. Start getting physical, next thing you know... you'll want to be honest, tell her everything. I'm not gonna say anything. It would just cause her more pain. What's happening to you, man?
Tankles away. Hit it. Present for the birthday girl. I hope you kept the receipt. It only shits in the cage, which you take out once a week.
You must've let them down, so they sent you a gift. You know with a private practice, I could do more normal work than I do now. Sandy, you're not seriously considering taking the job, are you ? The salary the offered me, it's outrageous. Since when have you been swayed by a paycheck ?
- He's locked up, yes? - Yeah, temporarily. Well, nobody blames you for bringing him into the community. You're so trusting. Hey, Julie. Their house looks good.
- We have to get to class. Come on. I do love Mr. Solomon Burke. Hey. I was...
- No, no way... - Seth. One second. Hang on a second. Listen, I am really connecting with this girl.
Maybe he can't handle it. Is it bad to burn on top of a peel? Yeah. Put 30 on. Coop, your life will stabilize. Your parents will work it out.
All right. Won't these costs be covered by Chapter 11? Well, filing for bankruptcy won't make this go away. The U.S. Attorney's Office is involved in this now. They'll push for fraud, unauthorized transactions.
- I do enjoy the crazy honeys. - You're not going. Okay, Mom, except that I am. It's a shady neighborhood. It's pretty hardcore. Dude, it's Long Beach, not Chechnya.
Your house is valued at 3.2, you got 2.6 in equity. That's a good start. You want me to sell my house? Julie will... - She'll leave me. - Julie cares about you and the kids.
But there's also a chance that hell can freeze over. You're not still mad at me, are you? I'm not mad. We're just over. Hey cutie. I saw your picture in the paper.
Anyway, he'll be there tomorrow. So I did good by you with "ball four"? - I hit a homerun? - I like the beaver shooting, where the players drilled holes in the doors of the hotel room and watched the stewardess fuckin'. Yeah, well, it's fun for the guys, but how would you like to have been on the other side?
I sedated him. He's got no cuts on his forehead. What's causing the bleeding? A rare condition called hematidrosis. Underneath the skin there are these tiny blood vessels, capillaries.
Water. Cold water. Huh? You put cold water in a... let's say a teapot, turn the stove on, the water gets hot, right?
Cold water. Huh? You put cold water in a... let's say a teapot, turn the stove on, the water gets hot, right? At some point it gets as hot as it will ever be, blistering.
Forgiveness is good for your health. Everybody's attention, please. Can I have your attention, please? When Augustus Hill died, we thought we lost him forever, but we didn't. He wrote a book about his life here... about your lives, and Kareem Said's last great act was to get Augustus' book published.
That's what this is all about. That's what makes everything happen. Not just in this room, but everywhere on the planet, in every corner of the universe, light generates life. But that's coming to an end. What are you talking about, how?
Not just in this room, but everywhere on the planet, in every corner of the universe, light generates life. But that's coming to an end. What are you talking about, how? When suns and stars explode they create new suns, new stars. And each time, these new entities are smaller, containing less energy.
We can make the trouble stay away. This is bullshit. He won't get them through inspection. He don't even know the right hacks. Yeah, I got that all figured out, all right?
I mean, what can we do to cure him? Your father has already agreed to electroshock therapy. My father? What the fuck does that old bastard have to do with anything? I know, it's unbelievable, but in the eyes of the law he is Cyril's guardian.
Get away! He's at that age. He's embarrassed by his mother. That can happen at any age. Did these two gentlemen tell you that i came looking for you? I heard.
Will you marry me? What did you say? I think I said, "Will you marry me?" Turk, wow! I got a ring.
I should have offered to pay you for them. No, you don't have to do that. You know, you have kids and you lose all sense of social decency. - Come in. - Okay. Milo, honey, put your trucks back for Mommy.
- Okay. Milo, honey, put your trucks back for Mommy. So how much were they? $485. Come on, Carrie. That's insane.
Here's hoping. I'll be with you soon. I'm getting slammed. For some reason the hostess keeps seating everyone in my section. Be right back. Suddenly Samantha realized why the raw food movement... was a movement.
Is it a whole generation or just him? As women's roles evolve and change, we assume that men's do as well. There are hundreds upon hundreds of articles... written about the new man. But does this new man really exist? Perhaps he's just the old man... renamed and repackaged by some clever P.R. Woman.
The next day I met Miranda and little lord Brady... for an early evening walk. If I get tired in about a block, can you push me around in that? Sure. Steve slept over the other night. On the couch.
- Where are you now? - I'm in my office. - Okay. As soon as you hang up the phone, go into Oliver's office and find his agenda. You need to know where the ship is heading 'cause you're the captain now. This is a great opportunity for you, Richard.
- I'm in my office. - Okay. As soon as you hang up the phone, go into Oliver's office and find his agenda. You need to know where the ship is heading 'cause you're the captain now. This is a great opportunity for you, Richard. People are wounded, they're confused.
- Trevor said they were cut. - Trevor? He said they were tacky. I like them. They are not cut.
- to practice unnatural - Get him off. Flash the lights. and unwholesome acts of depravity. Get him off. Flash the lights. Flash the lights!
Flash the lights. Flash the lights! I don't hate homosexuals, but I do hate what they do. Why? Because the Bible says if a man lie also with mankind as he lieth with a woman, they shall surely be put to death.
Anyway, that's the general idea. Questions? Okay, let's read this corpse! Look, I don't need any more ties. Yes, you do. Your ties are horrible.
Sorry. The slings and arr... Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and... The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them? Well, he's Darren's problem, isn't he? There's a daisy.
What? I was in love with an actress. Beautiful, talented actress and when we were together on the stage, it was like It was like having sex in public. I love that. And I have never felt this close to anyone. We played all the great love scenes and we meant it.
Was it love's siren song that brought you crashing on this rocks? I don't know why I'm here. I hate this fucking place. And I don't blame you. Drove you mad, didn't it?
Pull his string and he says What? Must I hold a candle to my shames? - Sorry to bother you, Geoffrey. - No, no, no, Richard. Here's a daisy.
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. I'm hardly an unbruised youth. Hi. You're here early. I bought some bran muffins.
No previews? Yeah. Just one dress rehearsal and then we open? Are you insane? You saw what happened on there.
Maybe this is her way of showing me that the dead can communicate with us. If she is a ghost, why do you think she waited so long to contact you? I don't know. There's just gotta be a rational explanation for this girl. Have you kept in contact with her parents?
It was raining and the bridge was slippery. The next thing I knew... It's okay. Okay. Funny thing is Emily always believed in ghosts.

Yes, but I have something he didn't: The key. Once I insert that key into the slot I'm convinced the answers will be revealed to me. I thought your key was stolen from your vault. It was.
Actually, Dad, she was down there this morning. This is Moore. I want a cleanup team to sterilize every inch of that storm cellar. I don't get it. We've been searching for that key for months.
-I think you need help, Lex. Between the island, your failed marriage and everything that's happened since you have experienced incredible emotional and physical trauma. And your prescription's more time on the couch? We just spent five sessions exploring my psyche. No, we spent five hours discussing your art collection your fascination with expensive cars everything except the most traumatic moments of your life.
-Having it and being afraid to write it. Perry "The Pit Bull" White backing off a story? That's hard to believe. Well, Lionel Luthor can be remarkably persuasive. Are you saying he had something to do with your career slide?
We'll be like James Dean and Natalie Wood in Rebel Without a Cause. -lt'll be romantic. -I don't think you understand. When I said I wasn't from here, I wasn't talking about Smallville. Where I'm from, we have colors that you've never seen.
I'm just Clark Kent. No, no, no, I'm not trying to expose you, Clark, I'm just... I'm just seeking the truth. The truth is I'm not who you think I am. If you can live with that decision, so can I.
I'm not here to make fun of you. Or to get you in trouble. - Then what do you want? - The truth. I promise I won't tell anyone. I input these coordinates into my transmitter, send a signal to my planet.
High school is irrelevant. Just gives me more time to concentrate on my work. - Where's your parents? - Foster parents. They work late.
- Well, I... - Mr Marsh, I am so sorry. We just moved here from Utah, and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... We forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh, boy, you must be furious! Well, no, no, I just...
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb Dumb, dumb, dumb All right, Martin. Let's get to work. And that's how it happened. - Yeah! - All right! Wait. Mormons actually know this story, and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? Well, sure! The story proves it, doesn't it?
he beat us. because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music, that we forgot to just play ! but why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars ? because that's what real artists do. people are always going to find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. if we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening !
- We have an enemy within. - How's Tom? - Assault team! - His reputation precedes him. 'He's a military legend, a public hero.'
- It's a grade double-A weapon. - That means devastating. The British traded the technology with the US for information on the H-bomb. - Oh dear. - It is odourless. Its molecules are adhesive.
So I did and there's a problem. They're sending it here. - 'A Libyan problem? ' - They're not saying, which scares me. Harry, they're ready for you.
I'm gonna fix it. You're a research scientist, not a field operative. Did that stop me from infiltrating a Goa'uld mothership? I think not. They've sent the MALP. The gate's not even being guarded.
- Point is, this isn't the program I wrote. It's been tampered with since it was sent. - Maybe it was Ba'al. - Ba'al? Think about it. He stood the most to gain. He took your idea and modified it to bring down the entire gate network,
Well, sir, we think we may have an explanation. We know the gate network undergoes periodic correlative updates to compensate for stellar drift. We've never witnessed it, but we believe the gates dial each other automatically to transmit the new coordinates that apply. And you believe Dr Felger's virus initiated one of these updates? It may have triggered an automatic internal protocol in the DHD.
Please. We knew you'd be here. How? Our intelligence network runs deep within the Jaffa of Moloc. We came to ask for help. I promise you will be safe.
Do not make this mistake. Moloc will not allow this to continue. - You give me no choice. - How many warriors have to die? Our sisters in your care will be returned safely, or the two of you will be sacrificed.
- A seriously flawed one. Even a Goa'uld symbiote wouldn't be able to compensate for long. We're still analysing genetic data, but for now we can tell you there was no evident trauma from energy weapons. What does that mean? The warrior's armour appears to possess advanced energy-absorption technology.
Not enough time to get systems back on line. They only launched missiles after we exploded our hyperdrive. It could have looked like an attack from their point of view. I agree, sir. Based on the weapons they fired, they're a sophisticated race. The EM pulse that hit our computers may have had the same impact on their planet.
I've asked the same question. For now, naquadria is our short cut to interstellar travel. More stable forms of energy don't provide enough power to run the hyperdrive. My advisors have expressed concern this is a military ship. What do I say to them?
- You are much closer than the others. Ah. With my help, you could complete the transformation. End up looking like those others? No, I assure you. You must know that you are capable of much more than the petty tasks that life among the Tauri can offer.
- Major Carter gets hurt. I saw it. Colonel O'Neill, what the hell's going on down there? It was a medical emergency. Major Carter was rushed to the infirmary with what looked like a staff blast wound. According to the villagers, we won't encounter Jaffa for days.
We don't even know what it is. Jonas and I think it's possible that this has something to do with Nirrti, that it's a step towards the creation of a Hok'tar. So you think this is the result of genetic manipulation. Jonas thinks the new tissue in his brain is somehow giving him precognitive abilities. For all I know, you may be right.

No, Michael Kelso. 'Let's do it in the men's room, it's more romantic.' No, what... I kicked that kid out of the handicapped stall so we could have more room! That 70's show Season 6 Episode 4 The Acid Queen Subtitles by Sir Martini What is Brooke's deal, man?
I read two periodicals a week about the Dewey Decimal system, which I'm sure you've never heard of. Okay I have heard of Dewey Decimal... it's Donald Ducks nephew. I can't believe Brooke. I mean standing there at the library, totally resisting me. I can't believe we have a library.
So you're saying that at exactly this time... you were with those two dead kids at the crash site? That's what I'm saying. So the girls aren't running away? But it's not like it's all wrapped up in a neat little bow. They've still gotta deal with life now that their little secret is out.
We're having a problem with a bird outside our office. Are you? Better than that, I think I may have a family of bats. - Margaret, this is Joe Quincy. - Yes, Joe.
Is this coming awfully close to a spot the Klan might produce? I was about to say. - You had the chicken? - Thank you. You know what we should do? We should use the same family. Yes! We get the same actors, driving an SUV this time.
Can I get back to you? Make sure you do. Josh thinks you should advance sales numbers of first homes to the Journal. The Times got existing home sales. Know what happens with negotiated press leaks?
The camera tilts down into a slowly thickening... Listen to this: Clear blue sky. The camera tilts down into a slowly thickening haze until it levels on a suburban street. An SUV filled with Mom, Dad, the kids, same actors from the other ad, and Rex.
- It's my pleasure. - Same, yes. - Why is science coming here? - It's about the vice president. - Come on in. You familiar with the NASA Commission on Space Science and Research?
Because you're following strict patterns and rules. They're evil bastards, Tony. It's not human. Well, unfortunately, Carol, that's exactly what it is. What I don't understand is what the ritual is. Why these people?
Yeah, yeah, the hotel owner? He tried to get people out, was beaten back for tha flames. - No-one else? - No. What we've also got here's a total and a deliberate targeting of the bed. What does the bed mean?
Let me tell you something. We're gonna get through all this, you hear me? - l know. - All of it. Anything come out?
Just make sure the towers look like they do, all right? All right. Thanks. - You cloned a what? - A computer.
I was thinking if I turned around and went back to New York... so Mr. Spaulding could consult with his attorney... Andy Deaver would be dead by the time I got back. I can also tell you what I was not thinking. I was not thinking about his constitutional rights. I was not thinking about evidence suppression, or even this trial. That's the job of this court.
- Leave me alone. I can understand why you wanna be alone. It's nice here. Clare, I understand why you feel the way you do. I lost both my parents when I was 11.
Is that what Metcalf called it? That's what the arson report called it. - I didn't burn down his damn building. - But you had reason to, right? Metcalf underbid me on my first 12 jobs I went after.
I know. Thirty-four years in the service, already they've forgotten about him. There's something you need to see. It's over here. Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Silver Star... Vietnam Service Medal, Liberation of Kuwait.
Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Silver Star... Vietnam Service Medal, Liberation of Kuwait. - Are they in order of importance? - No. If they were it would be Silver Star first, then Bronze Star.
Married, lives in Yonkers. He was supposed to spend some time with them. He never showed. What do we have from the Army? They've turned it over to CID but they're passing the buck.
He was supposed to spend some time with them. He never showed. What do we have from the Army? They've turned it over to CID but they're passing the buck. Why aren't they taking care of their own?
Why do you think he brought you to Washington in the first place? It was to run interference with me. No, I don't buy that for a second. Jack Malone is a very talented agent... and I understand why you respect him. But he's a free swinger.
But you're not romantically involved? No. We're just good friends. I, uh ... saw that Annie has a computer. We only have one phone line so I didn't sign up for it and she really just uses the computer for her video stuff. What do you know about those videos? You mean "The Annie and Siobhan Show"?
What's that? - Drugs. What does this mean? Where there are drugs, there's usually drug dealers. Her parents try to give her a normal life.
It feels like it's beating out of my chest, and I can't catch my breath all the time. I can tell you there's nothing wrong with your heart, Natasha. - What you're describing is a panic attack. - So what do I do about it? Tell me about these incidents.
Thanks, man. All right. The apartment didn't tell us much. Couple of old shirts in the closet. Coffee maker on the table. No plane tickets. No bus schedules. No receipts.
All right. The apartment didn't tell us much. Couple of old shirts in the closet. Coffee maker on the table. No plane tickets. No bus schedules. No receipts. Isn't it so much easier when they leave the Amtrak schedule right on the coffee table?
It was a gift from her first mentor. It's probably doubled in value since it's been splattered all over the media. I've got calls in to some high-end violin dealers. Any bites? There's a definite black market here, so I don't think... it's gonna take long for some greedy soul to show up.
Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing... and shortly, it will renne my loins in twain, burst forth, and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment. That's so beautiful. Yes, it's... it's... No, I can't do this! Oh, how could Amy leave me?

the meteor destroyed all society, butters, now earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad ! those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals ! oh god ! i hate cannibals ! they're coming this way. i can hear them.
now just smoldering, burnt piles of rubble. oh, oh, it's terrible ! we're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit: a hole in the earth over two miles in diameter. whoa... here we are at the old gas station.
And the media took the bait. They portrayed the dirty bomb as an extraordinary weapon that would kill thousands of people and, in the process, they made the hidden enemy even more terrifying. But, in reality, the threat of a dirty bomb is yet another illusion. Its aim is to spread radioactive material through a conventional explosion. But almost all studies of such a possible weapon have concluded that the radiation spread in this way would not kill anybody because the radioactive material would be so dispersed and, providing the area was cleaned promptly, the long-term effects would be negligible.
And the evidence for that organisation was provided for them by an ex-associate of Bin Laden's called Jamal Al-Fadl. During the investigation of the 1998 bombings, there is a walk-in source, Jamal Al-Fadl who is a Sudanese militant who was with Bin Laden in the early 90s who has been passed around a whole series of Middle East secret services. None of whom want much to do with him and who ends up in America and is taken on by the American government, effectively as a key prosecution witness. And is given a huge amount of American taxpayers' money at the same time. His account is used as raw material to build up a picture of Al Qaeda.
But now, the neoconservatives became all-powerful because this terror network proved that what they had been predicting through the 1990s was correct: that America was at risk from terrifying new forces in a hostile world. A small group formed that began to shape America's response to the attacks. At its heart were Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, along with the vice-president, Dick Cheney and Ric Perle, who was a senior advisor to the Pentagon. The last time these men had been in power together was 20 years before, under President Reagan.
To do this, the Americans allied themselves with a group called the Northern Alliance. They were a loose collection of warlords, fighting a war of resistance against the Taliban the Islamists who controlled Afghanistan. The Taliban's best troops were the thousands of foreign fighters from the training camps, who the Northern Alliance hated. And now, they took their revenge on the foreign fighters. The Americans believed that these men were Al Qaeda terrorists, and the Northern Alliance did nothing to disabuse them of this because they were paid by the Americans for each prisoner they delivered.
We're determined to stop the enemy before he can strike our people. The Americans called them "sleeper cells," and decided that they had just been waiting to strike. But in reality there is very little evidence that any of those arrested had anything at all to do with terrorist plots. From Portland to the suburb of Buffalo called Lackawa, yet again the Americans were chasing a phantom enemy. They say "terrorist sleeper cell." That's what they call the Lackawanna people a terrorist sleeper cell the Detroit people a terrorist cell, the Portland people a terrorist cell.
The bombings in Madrid showed this only too clearly. But this is not a new phenomeno What is new is the way the American and other governments have transformed this complex and disparate threat into a simplistic fantasy of an organised web of uniquely powerful terrorists who may strike anywhere and at any moment. But no one questioned this fantasy because, increasingly, it was serving the interests of so many people. For the press, television, and hundreds of terrorism experts, the fact that it seemed so like fiction made it irresistible to their audiences.
Thank you. And now, back to our story. The scale of this fantasy just kept growing as more and more groups realised the power it gave them. Above all, the group that had been instrumental in first spreading the idea: the neoconservatives. Because they now found that they could use it to help them realise their vision: that America had a special desiny to overcome evil in the world and this epic mission would give meaning and purpose to the American people.
What if they had access to it? What if they could effectively deploy it? What if we weren't prepared? What it is is a shift from the sciific, "What is" evidence-based decision making to this speculative imaginary, "What if" - based, worst case scenario. And it was this principle that now began to shape government policy in the war on terror.
you lock them up based on what you think or speculate they might do in the future. And how-how can a person who's locked up based on what you think they might do in the future disprove your speculation? It's impossible, and so what ends up happening is the government short-circuits all the processes that are designed to distinguish the innot from the guilty because they simply don't fit this mode of locking people up for what they might do in the future. The supporters of the precautionary principle argue that this loss of rights is the price that society has to pay when faced by the unique and terrifying threat of the Al Qaeda network. But, as this series has shown, the idea of a hidden, organised web of terror is largely a fantasy and by embracing the precautionary principle, the politicians have become trapped in a vicious circle:
But with the attacks of September 11th, the fates of both dramatically changed. The Islamists, after their moment of triumph were virtually destroyed within months while the neoconservatives took power in Washington. But then, the neoconservatives began to reconstruct the Islamists. They created a phantom enemy.

Are you part of the entourage? Or maybe the entertainment? If that isn't frightfully rude. - I just come for the party. Harry Likes his parties.
You're a good dancer. You can take Harry out of The Stardust, but you'll never take The Stardust out of Harry. Already people sense he's different to the usual colonial day trippers. - Can I have a quiet word? - Certainly.
- What was that? - Nothing. A false note. Don't waste your time, Miss Sharp. All foreign languages are ancient Greek to my sisters.
And look. He gave me his precious bird. - Well, surely that is a good sign. - I know! I know!
I suppose the thing that motivates people to use direct action is a sense of powerlesness, in the face of governments who don´t seem to be responsive. And on the other hand a sense of moral outrage against the society, which they don´t see as being responsive. A moral outrage directed against people who they see as being in some way doing something which is obviously reprehensible and wrong. I think what motivates most people, certainly what motivated me to take direct action, was the amount of suffering of animals are being subjected to. People are given no choice, but to take direct action.
There are ample resources available to the police as can be seen; to attend any protest, say, a fox hunt or outside a vivisection laboratory in this country. And often the tactics of the police is unacceptably aggresive. What are essentially peacefull protesters. Are you gonna surrender that weapon and provide your details, or I am going to arrest you. I do not have a weapon on me!
Are you gonna surrender that weapon and provide your details, or I am going to arrest you. I do not have a weapon on me! And in a lot of cases the hunt saboteurs are battery controling the hounds and they hunt themselves. Look. Its a homemade whip.
But we have become stronger. Things which previously in many cases were not illegal have now been made illegal. And the punishments and so on and the attitude of the courts is corespondingly different. It made it harder to find people to take part sometimes in these direct forms of action. Because the consequences of doing so might be more extreme.
And for us to give them rights, if we have the power to do that is just speciecist. I couldn´t campaign as an animal rights activist, if I didn´t believe, that we will close these places down. Forms of protest in general are not likely to go away. Over the last 10 years we have in this country rediscovered protest as a new form of politics in a way. So people who are often written of by politicians as being apathetic are very oftenly young.
A Teenage Daddy? Who is this guy? Is he a porn producer? Klitz, shut up. Now, the strippers.
- Should we come back? No, I'll leave you guys alone. What's up? Hey, man, what's up with those girls? - What about them?

Looked like Leonard was trying to get the breaking pitch inside, but it just didn't have any break on it that time. Agent Mackelway. I was gonna introduce you two, but I understand that won't be necessary.
He imagined someone with no patterns, no telltale fetishes, no rituals, just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue. Yeah, but a serial killer, by definition, is condemned to repetition, isn't he? I mean, isn't that what he's all about? Well, he is until he isn't. And this Suspect Zero, is that something that you believe in, doctor?
We saw things men shouldn't see. Agony. Torture. Evil. It never shut off. I checked once with all the guys that had been on the project when it was just used for intel. You know, finding... gun-runners and drug lords, Soviet missile sites... even the Iran hostages.
I think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat, sprung this on him once the car was moving. Lab picked up talcum traces along the edges of the paper consistent with powdered gloves. So he gets this dropped in his lap, it spooks him, car ends up in the ravine. That car was pushed to the state line. The depth of the tire tracks. Footprints near the embankment.
Too bad. Not... you know... not necessarily. We can order  <hon>these<hoff> for you. Special order. And, uh...
He cannot think clearly anymore. He knows a lot about us. He is gonna die soon, anyway... Maybe not early enough. It's not only about him, but about his guy as well. What about him? The police is after him.
They didn't hear anything either. Because the glass crashed right into the flower box...silently. No traces were found on the projectile. Small plastic traces were found. He used a special projectile. Probably self made...9mm with a plastic casing that bursts into tiny pieces once it leaves the barrel... so we can't find out with which gun he shot... They didn't find any traces on the dead body, no fractures, not even bruises.
A little itty-bitty bean. It's not a little, itty-bitty bean. It's an average-sized bean, Mikey. And I got news for you. There are kids in the world who'd walk 50 miles through quicksand just to stick a toe in your pool.

As I was the second-born I could see my turn approach'ing. A year or two later I'd be getting engaged and married too, and there would be no way out for me. So I decided... I realized that if I wanted to get out, I'd have to go somewhere, learn, get a general education. I went to see my parents and I told them I wanted to leave the yeshiva where l was studying and go to another school.
he was blond... A real work of arrt. As he crossed the room you could feel an awed silence take hold. It was a moment of suspended animation. For a long time, it was hard to approach him. The other boys avoided studying with him, afraid they'd be suspected ofwanting something from him.
I knew nothing ofthe secular world. Not even the language, Hebrew. At home we spoke Yiddish. I starrted working as a delivey boy for a green grocer. I worked there for a month. The job was located within the Ultra-Orrthodox zone.
It's not a spaceship. It's the most elegant and graceful creature of the ocean, the giant Pacing manta ray. Rays are closely related to sharks, with the same rough skin and a skeleton made of lightweight, flexible cartilage. For feeding, they glide through the water altering plankton with their sponge-like gill rakes. Weighing as much as 3,000 pounds, these graceful giants are found in tropical oceans and can have wingspans of up to 22 feet.
For feeding, they glide through the water altering plankton with their sponge-like gill rakes. Weighing as much as 3,000 pounds, these graceful giants are found in tropical oceans and can have wingspans of up to 22 feet. Don't worry, though, they're harmless towards humans. Check out the tactic of the remora fish. They hitch a ride by auctioning themselves to the manta's body.
Look at this sand tiger shark. I know. They are scary looking, but in fact, they are not dangerous to humans. Sharks are amongst the ocean's most ancient animals. They were here 100 million years before the dinosaurs.
Squid, octopus and lobster are very popular Surprisingly, sharks don't eat all that much, and some go for weeks without eating anything. They are picky eaters and do not eat what does not taste good to them. People, for example. Every yean pregnant sand tiger sharks, like the one you see here, stay around this reef for a full month without eating anything.
It grows there because pregnant females don't use their teeth during this period. I guess they don't floss, either By the way, despite their ugly faces, these guys have been pretty nice to me so far But I'm not pushing it. It's best to leave before dark when the hunt begins.
This silvertip, like other sharks, is the ultimate hunted perfectly adapted for seeking out and extracting their prey. Check out these fish. What's going on here? They don't appear to be particularly frightened by the silvertip shark. Strange, though, since they are trevallies, a bite-sized snack for sharks.
Hey, whoever thought up these names didn't need too much imagination, eh? But, sure enough, you know a hammerhead when you see one. These sharks are not small. They are between 6-to-12 feet long. They sure don't go around unnoticed.
Feeding frenzy. This 18-foot great hammerhead has picked up the scent of a dead female reef shark that died during mating, victim of bites from overly excited males. It glides in, scoops up an easy meal and carries it away. The great hammerhead is one of the few sharks that eats other sharks. Unlike sharks, dolphins have a nearly mystical status among you humans.
- But everyone knows it, Mr. Branzger. I haven't heard it for ages. And you? is there any chance of listening to it now? The record player is in the bookcase and so is the record.
You have a di_erent fiancé every week? What should I do, Miss Shams? Each time I tighten my grip on one, he runs away Oh well... I guess they don't deserve you You doctors keep moaning about working hard there you are, basking in the sun reading your newspaper
He still don't wanna talk I'm at the end of my tether, Shams This is Shams, she's determined to talk to you I sure wanna talk to him to give him the chance of a lifetime I knew you're a talented architect and I chose you to handle the interior design of my ballet school The one I will build, twenty years from now I'd better leave you two alone No doctor, we don't wanna waste your time we'll go sit somewhere suitable for a fight over the school's designs I wanna discuss your fees too but don't you think you can take advantage of me and make me pay an exorbitant price This is my story
- Yes it is What's wrong Hind? I'm very mad at Yussef I can't believe he still hasn't called us after all this time We don't know his circumstances I'm worried sick about him This whole trip has been pretty strange ls it possible he don't even know where he'll be staying?
What about you? - What about me? - What about your right? Those who are unfair to others have no right at all, Yussef The whole life is unfair to them, their sole right is to find love coz love would fairly make up for any pain they endured in this life
Hind made a big sacrifice I wouldn't be able to make in her place Her sacrifice made me carry on my dream and go back to the ballet dancing I hold very dear Only today, only today I found myself able to reward her 15 years later The interior design prizes
Yes, but it's for the catalogue... Cesar, we're talking too much... Get to work. Cesar, I'm sorry to wake you up but I couldn't wait. Your new pictures are perfect.
My husband had gone to a rally, it was May Day. I'd gone to the roof to bring in some laundry. And a scarf escaped from my hands, flying away to the house where some new neighbors had just moved in. When I went to get the scarf, guess who opened the door? Lisa? Her husband was at the rally, too. So then... How can I not believe in them; a coincidence changed my life?
No, no, don't worry, don't worry. Just describe this place so I know where I am. We're near "Mist" and "Loneliness" Streets. I'm close, really, thanks a lot. Could we meet some other day?
What the hell are we waiting for? We can't go through the front gates. They are locked. What should we do? There is a way out in the basement.
This is so heavy! Falling from here... could only mean death, huh? yeah. I bet people kill themselves here. On the contrary, Uluwatu is known...for a myth about turtles.
- Lying? - I just got off the phone with Hammond. You didn't have a status call scheduled. I screwed up earlier. The SAT transmission on my system was forged by own people.
OK. Maia, honey. We have a rule. No shoes on the furniture. - I don't want them to get wet.
Shawn. - We'll talk again. - Oh, I can't wait. We're going to see Fountains Of Wayne this weekend. Have fun. You know, this whole loner thing is so tired.
Come on, Jordan, aren't you overreacting? No, I'm not at all. Publishing the names and addresses of the 4400 is a crime, Barbara. It's a violation of the privacy of over 4,000 people. Whoever did it should be prosecuted.
So, we pulled their personnel records and found one Dean Keating. As in Gail Keating - Friday Harbor murder victim? - Dean's her older brother. - Not only that. Gail's younger brother, Glenn works construction and on his last job the company was short two dozen blasting caps.
Thanks. We're running out of time. There! Truck number 85. That vehicle's assigned to Dean Keating.
If he is concealing information that would exonerate me because I had an affair with Irina, convince him to give it to you. If not for my sake, then for your sister's. Ok, here's what we found out from Project Blackhole. The Restoration refers to documents written about the Passenger. Now that's the bad news.
In one of his session with Barnett, Sloane admitted having an affair with Irina while you were married. What are you saying? Lauren is Covenant? I can't be sure.
Go. This is just a sedative, Nadia, so you can rest. What you did yesterday, destroying all the fluid like that... I want you to know I was not angry with you. I was proud of your courage.
All right, which one of you stole my crimelight? Well, "stole" is-is very negative. I-I had borrowed it, and, uh, I-I replaced it. I put it back. Well, it would be nice if you charged it first.
Depends on what you tell us. Look, all I know is what I hear on the news. Maybe we can help you know more. See this hair? This was taken from the chair that Mike Handover was killed in.
Have lunch at the Wayfare Grill today? - Shark steak. - Sounds delicious. A valet attendant stole your phone from your car. I was thinking someone from the gym stole it.
You know I don't mind getting my hands dirty. I mean maggots, wet trash I'm the first one in. Okay, so what are you waiting for? Ants. Ants? / Yes, I have got a problem with ants.
It's why I come up here. Just close your eyes. Rely on your inner senses. Listen to the wind. We're running out of volunteers.
And you know about all this? Magic? Demons? I'm getting a quick education. It won't do you much good. I only need you long enough for the witches to attempt a rescue.
What are you talking about? Well, she helped you see your future with a Vision Quest, right? Gave you something to look forward to, life after demons... That's what Leo needs. Yeah, but there's no guarantees that Leo would see that.
This has been quite a remarkable day, even for me. So, what do you say? Do we have a deal? Piper I have something to tell you. - Paige. You know that brown suede coat?

But a player can only make one school happy. Herman was about to piss off a university, so they kill him? Pretty far out theory, Billy. Maybe not a president, or a dean, but... you'd be suprised what the round ball's made grown men do. Yeah, there was a car... for a day.

How are you feeling about J.D.? Where's the candy? Reggie. What? Crazy girls don't need a little chocolate?
You come here because you hate men. You're a beautiful woman who hates men. God, I hope your last name's Allen. It's not. All the women I know hate men.
No habla ingles. Have you ever been to Hawaii? Ay, dios mio. I just got back from a vacation in Hawaii. I'm here to pick up my mail.
You do that you know. - You re-hold the love. - Yeah. How can I re-hold that which I do not possess ? Eat your breakfast.
I can't take the chance. Especially now. Everyone in Cleaves Mills knows that you... Johnny Smith, the psychic who is never wrong warned me. Mr Rowin.
- There must be warning signs. - Each kid is different, but there are some things to look for. He'll probably expressing anger in other ways, vandalism or making threats, verbally or in writing. Some kids posts their threats on a website. Yes.
- You're not having a good idea in this place. - No, no, no, I'm over it. I I gotta know. You understand, right? - As long as we're all in agreement about this.
Good to see you, andy. Don't be afraid to shake with me, eddie. I ain't contagious no more. Highly becoming outfit. I'm here for my belongings.
Whereas you, dan, you show me foresight, and loyalty, the way you handled making the find. Just know when i'm outta my depth. Amateur. Yet the widow suspects foul play. I know al wants her leaving here with as least of a sour taste in her mouth as possible.
What? Do i have a strange odor about me? What is that, your clever way of saying you smell whiskey on my breath? No. If either of your fucking eyes takes me for hiding i'm drinking again occasionally, it's sadly mistaken, so desist from any clever odor references.
What have you done with your little posse? - They're with the new nanny. - Wow. Your own personal nanny? Smell you. Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
Because I want what's about to happen to you to hurt as much as is humanly possible. I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that. Trust is a fragile thing. - Bye, guys! - Bye, Mom! Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
I messed up the floor trying to get out the blood. - I'll tell my dad that you stopped by. Zach, do you have plans for dinner? - So you shop a lot, huh? - Yeah. So?
Susan, is that you? Mike? I'm upstairs... sort of. Hang on. I'll - - I'll be right up. What happened?
She's a total nightmare. I guess I shouldn't have challenged her. Oh, dear. Because now no one on the play committee even wants to talk to me. Oh, Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom. It hasn't really changed since girl scouts.
It's okay, Sam, I'll do it. - Thanks, Haleh. - No problem. Listen, Haleh, I, uh, I think you might have been off a decimal point ony pylo m patient's dopamine. Excuse me?
- That's good, right? - It's perfect. You can sit up. - Forget it. Just send two units O-neg. - You should also do this in the shower.
From what we've been able to learn, this happened eight months ago. Both sides have been decimated. There are no major cities left. Millions are dead. Your faith was going to bring peace.
What I hear, you have some pretty powerful weapons yourself. I made her tell me everything. -Not that I believe all of it. -Do we really need these people? What do you mean, "these people"?
There's one simple reason why you should help me, Captain. And what's that? I can send you back to your century. History's been changed. The century I left will be completely different. Once I've defeated the temporal agents... I'll reverse the damage done to your timeline.
Where is he? Alicia, you been like a little sister to us. You gonna start keeping secrets now? Where's my Engineer? Silik.
Start falling back! We got to get the hell out of here! I guess we have to say goodbye all over again. -It's harder the second time. -Can't argue with that.
Go fuck yourself, Eric. Why are you mad at me? I didn't do anything. Come on, E. Let's go, these girls are hot. They won some KROQ premiere contest.
We danced to Spandau Ballet at our wedding. That was memorable. Yeah, that says a lot about you. Come on, I'll have Louise make a phone call. Louise, did that drug sample come in?
Okay. - Yeah. Debra, you just weren't ready to receive that message. Sometimes in life, things gotta get a lot worse before they get better. It's just like shoes!
You're the best sons any mother could hope for. Why do I suddenly want jelly doughnuts? Oh, these shelves are so beautiful. And flowers! Glad you like 'em, Mom.
Don't you love our new couch? You know what? I really do. I'm starting to love everything now. I was gonna do my workout on the new Muscleflex after dinner... but you know what? What?
You have a great body and you're not afraid to show it. ...is what I think Amy is thinking. Right, hot stuff? Deb, don't pay any attention to those women. They're just jealous.
It's ambitious." We filmed it in my garage. I had a big garage, but still, it was ambitious to film a TV show in a garage. Darkplace was a turning point for me as a writer, because until then I'd been writing horror. For this I wanted them to go "Ooooh."
My aunt lives in Scotland. She says it's quite nice. Well, she's wrong. GHOSTLY SCOTTISH MUTTERING Bloody things. Look, the mist is retreating. She's right, the mist is retreating.
You're so good to me, and you go to all this trouble... and you get me everything I want, then I don't want it anymore. I'm sorry that you have to be in love with a crazy person. Come here. I'll tell you what. I'll deal with as much moodiness and food weirdness... as you can dish out as long as you do... the actual "squeezing a human being out of your body" part. - Deal. - Okay.
You know, I remember the night I got married. I was panicked. I thought, "This is it. "I'll never have a chance to be with anyone else. "This is it for life. " If only I'd had a crystal ball, I might've been able to eat my salad.
- And also, Andrew McCarthy at his best. Though Less Than Zero runs a very close second. I'm sure it does. - You hated the movie. - Yes.
Almost done with your radiator, young lady. Take your time. You were smart. You come back early, you beat the rush. I just wanted to get a jump on things.
That's how common they were -- children watching cartoons. - That was the word. - I've forgotten your point. Where are all the anvils? I mean, is there some sort of secret anvil storage facility the government is keeping from us?
Me, too, over by the hair stand -- newsstand. I smelled it by Gypsy's -- horrible. So the whole town smells? How can that be possible? - It is an old town -- 200 years.
- Yeah, same here. - You on your way back to work? - Yeah. You? - Yeah. I'm going to Doose's. - You were just at the inn.
- They say you have a gift. - They like to talk. You hide behind your intelligence. Yeah, that's pretty stupid. And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously.
- They like to talk. You hide behind your intelligence. Yeah, that's pretty stupid. And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter.
- No, the seventh is... - God, you must be fun at parties. I think we both know the flawin that theory. - How's the sister? - Heart rate is normal, kidney is functioning.
She's a mother. - She's a schizophrenic mother with no money, on the public dole, in fact, who knocks back vodka every time a breeze blows her way. Mickey Mantle had a whole bar named after him. He got a transplant. Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit. Plan "B"-- surgery to resect the tumor. Joe Bergin does the gamma knife thing.
Watch your whole family... everything you've ever known and loved disintegrate in a second? All he ever wanted to do was play it straight, you know? Toe the line. I know this sounds stupid... but this isn't about the money. Go on. In the '20s, my grandfather bought a stone.
They were only here for a day. Nice people, though. She's known who we are all along. This is how you deal with bastards. Our beauty therapists are specially trained.
Ok, bye. It's Judith. Sorry. Thank you. The government doesn't care because power only cares about itself.
Are you ok? No. I'm crazy, remember? No, that's not what I meant. Just forget it. I'm sorry.
I mean it. What's her story? These girls. kids from Russia or someplace, they come in here every day trying to scam me. Phoney scripts?
I don't know. She was the one I thought I'd... spend forever with. Well, uh, don't tell me you're, uh, going back to where you came from the kill the guy. It was a woman. You ever watch pornography? You don't have to answer that.
Are you in fact betraying the public trust? On the contrary, George. I am trusting the public. I mean what gives me the right to decide what you can and can't see? I am not more entitled than Miss Buckley is to decide for you what is going to uplift and enlighten you. Oh, there she goes again with that liberal duck and parry.
That doesn't mean that I didn't say it. Anyway. Where was I. Hmm, the pool! Well, I don't want to be indiscreet here, but there was an incident in a pool with two girls and um... I mean... These girls were real knockouts.
You guys, don't tell me you don't think she's trouble. Well, yeah, the cat thing was a bit much. Yeah, and that story about meeting Anne Heche in the restaurant? I mean, what was that about? Ugh. And you guys.
- I got a favour to ask you. I want you to take care of my car while I'm gone. That was your mother's car. That's the last you have of hers. Why don't you put it in storage?
And if you think this has been a bad day, just wait until tomorrow. There might be one guy. He goes way back. A name. Tolliver. Gaming regulations say you have to stay out of the surveillance room.
- Here you go. - Put it down. Also, all guests must have a current room key card. That means every card needs to be swiped. I want you to keep an eye out for crashers, stolen IDs. If anyone charges drinks to rooms that don't exist or uses names that don't match... do not hesitate to remove them from the premises.
My client's rape kit isn't enough? Bruises, bites, contusions, strangulation marks on her neck? That could have been caused by rough sex. Are you just looking for reasons not to bring charges? This case won't be easy to win.
Men change. Especially when their wives file for legal separation. My investigator checked the court documents. He also found out that your wife took the kids and moved with an other. You have no right to use my personal life to make your case.
Now, he says we're not jumping to any conclusions. Are we? No. Guy just liked hanging out with hookers in his spare time. Hookers cut or stab, they don't strangle.
Brit... Shut up! Find the plastic surgeon. I want to get out of here! Of course, sweetheart. They were never anything but nice to that Agnes girl.
How do we know the video was made the night of the alleged rape? What if it's been edited? We have the only copy. It has not been edited at all. And you can prove that? I'm sorry, Ms. Novak, but the First Amendment trumps all.
I do have one or two other people to see. Careful! - I'm very sorry. - It's all right, Dennis. Safe now.
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16-year-old kid. A girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I... I accidentally ripped her dural sack. It's at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together. Membrane as thin as tissue, and...
Okay, hon. Then there was this time at the store with this huge shoplifter and he... Beautiful Bianca is ready to make the Fashionistas swoon in her flowing crepe jumpsuit... This is nice. What'd you think of the Versace?
I have to tell you... I think this is a bad idea. Why are you saying that? Because I thought of it? No, I'm saying that because I think it's a bad idea. A lot of marriages are like this bouquet. Look at these roses.
No, I'm saying that because I think it's a bad idea. A lot of marriages are like this bouquet. Look at these roses. Aren't they beautiful? And everyone admires them.
I don't know. Well, we have to do something. Randy's falling apart. I almost feel sorry for him. What?
I can do it. I can do it. One more time. One more. Adrian, you're wearing out the digital chip. What happened to the old machine? - I spilled some coffee on it.
So he decided to hide his illegitimate fortune. He melted down the gold, mixed in a little black ink... any amateur chemist could have done it and then he began to write. And write and write and write and write. It was mostly nonsense, gibberish, really... anything that popped into his head. He ran out of things to talk about after five pages, but he just kept on writing.
Yeah, I'm checking on that. Meaning you forgot. That's good work, Abbs. I just realized something. Gibbs never gives me any compliments? No
What's that supposed to mean? Why was there only one prototype made? I funded all the RD personally. I don't have pockets that deep. This loss is just devastating.
Abby? I think Houston has a problem. Ash, what's going on? Lost the signal. Give me a second.
Well, she said that they were using his computer. A Trojan would give them backdoor access. You kiss your mother with that mouth, McGee? No, Tony, a Trojan's a program. It's like a virus; it establishes a gateway to a computer and allows a hacker to control the system.
We had a tough couple of days. Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties. The flowers are a mea culpa. Tony, I'm blown away. They're gorgeous.
Cadaver dogs coming up. - This your cabin, Mr Clay? - No. No. My land stops right over there at the tree line there.
I wasn't expecting to see you. You usually hate these things. If it's for Annie's school, it's the least I could do. I'm used to going to these things by myself. Then tonight's no exception.
Mrs. Busberger told me you'd been to a BOTOX party. But, honestly, Miss Garcia, this doesn't look like the result of BOTOX. It's not really BOTOX. Then what was injected into your face? My girlfriend Lillian and me... she's a housekeeper for a family in Boca... we were having our nails done at Madam Rose's... and we were talking about our ladies.
And I just wanted to go home. - Don't worry. You'll get another chance. - That's the thing. I'm not sure I will.
Oh, hello, Alex. How are we today ? Here, finally. Can you carry these to the storeroom ? The storeroom, sure.
Give me a call. Lucas. Lucas? - What hurts the most? - All of it. So you broke up with Brooke to be with Peyton? You think that's wrong?
Oh, Brooke. Hi. Lucas told you we broke up? Actually, yeah. Okay.
-You should have told me about the letter. -I know! Then why didn't you? Why would you hide it from me? Because we were having fun again. Brooke, having our friendship back has been really great.
No thanks to you. What? You caused a lot of problems, Felix. They'll get over it. Felix, you do this everywhere we go.
Well, gratuitous man-sex is one thing. Personally, I don't mind it. We know. But gratuitous violence, that's another story. Actually, I don't consider it gratuitous.
Play with this long enough, and you will be. Would you just hand it... you're not... running around the streets with a concealed weapon. I told you... "it's necessary". So that you and Cody can be the gay avengers, heroes of the resistance. Martyrs to the cause?
I'm going to be working at the food court... at burger barn. That sounds horrible to me, but you seem happy, so... yay! Don't you get it? Girls come to the mall to shop. Shopping makes them hungry.
They'll kill us. Relax, they aren't gonna to find out. They still don't know about the time pearce ate all those batteries. I never had more energy. Saturday night, the boy becomes a man.
Now, all we have to do is figure out what the hell that bacterium is. - Question: How do we find out? - Answer: Fluorescent DNA probes. - Which are? - Smart  <hon>bombs<hoff>.
This is the result of the probe we ran in the wiring for the Buffalo substation. This is from samples we received today, Chicago. Same wire. There are a number of wire manufacturers, but these 2 are both from Pacific North. Okay, so we've explosions at 2 different substations, same wire, can't be a coincidence.
- It's not like a camel either. - Problem is, there's nothing like a camel. - Except a vicuna. - A wh-who-na? A vicuna.
- No, we'd have to grow them. - But, isn't that illegal? That's why we're trying to change the law. But a stem cell is a human life. Well, that would depend upon your definition of human and life, wouldn't it?
We couldn't connect their deaths to the treatment. Oh. Okay, so Booker's clean? We weren't asked to judge Booker. We were asked to judge his trial.
Behave yourself. Go! Go! Hey, hi! So what are we having for dinner?
He wanted to know how to make Brucellosis. That's a dirty little bug. You didn't tell him, did you? - Of course not. - I'm just asking.
You're the one who brought her here. You're the one who's fucking her. We got a Reimer. It's amazing. No bigger than a bar fridge, turns salt water, human waste, anything, into pure drinking water.
But you and your crew were the only ones who got sick? Yeah. Only ones that left, only ones that got sick. What about the suits? I mean... could the hazmat suits have been faulty? No, the gear was cool, you know.
Bucky ball? They're the roundest and most symmetrical large molecule known to man. They're beautiful. And they're made into nanofibres, which are like a millionth of a centimetre wide and a thousandth of a centimetre long, and then they put those together and... You know, this is one of the first applications of industrial nanotechnology.

And they're made into nanofibres, which are like a millionth of a centimetre wide and a thousandth of a centimetre long, and then they put those together and... You know, this is one of the first applications of industrial nanotechnology. You see, a Bucky ball is carbon, like a diamond, but it's hollow, so it's light.
- That's bullshit? - Oh, no. - I didn't say that. - Then what are you saying? You studied the therapy.
You know, meanwhile... Boy, you're gonna love this. - She's got this sort of, like, gaggle of chicks. And they ride my ass as well. I can tell, because when I walk in a room everybody shuts up.
Okay. Neena, a word? Oh, it's so on. You got something to say? Say it. The thing about strong women...
I want to meet this Dr. Reid! No problem! Frick! Turk, wait! Let's sit down and talk about this.
Elliot, the man tried to electrocute me an hour ago. All I care about is whether or not this twitch goes away. You should take Doug down to the morgue. The worst he could do there is bring somebody back to life! Carla, when I became chief resident, I wrote a pledge to myself.
The worst he could do there is bring somebody back to life! Carla, when I became chief resident, I wrote a pledge to myself. And do you know what it said? It said "Dance like nobody is watching". Which I do, -constantly- in my living room, with the shades closed just in case somebody is watching.
Some gigantic technical problem with sculpture number something. Nothing else exists when art does. Yes? Wow, this is a fantastic restaurant. Yes? It used to be, not so much anymore.
Maybe we should just buy her a stapler... wrap it in brown paper, and just smear some dog poo on it. Think she'd be comfortable with that? Fine, we'll get the dish. Ladies, I have something to tell you... and you're not going to like it. If you get married and leave me all alone, I will kill you.
Papers to grade, yard work, I should really finish that article. That was nice of you to talk with Claire's friend this morning, I guess that goes on in your classroom all the time. What? Intellectual discussions with young women in skimpy fashions.
- Wait! OK. - Come here. Oh, my God, this feels amazing. - Can you believe nature just makes this? - Nature doesn't make it, the landscapers do.
When you loose somebody you love, you truly have lost a part of yourself, because you shared a lifetime with this person. - when you're feeling completly lost. - What if you haven't? - Well, if you don't feel lost... - No I didn't get to share a lifetime with her!
Jesus man, did you fart? No. Yeah you did, holy fucking christ. It was the body. What?

And scary... because if I can do that, maybe I'm capable of anything. You are. No, that's you, mom. Cause I don't know if I would've had the strength to hold on for three months, not knowing where I was and if dad would pull through. Well, my father used to tell me, life asks of you what it thinks you can handle.
I saw you. How come you're not going all love slave? I don't know. What's your point? That science report' sin mandy's faux prada bag.
Besides, the last time Lex confronted him about it... it almost got him killed. But if we found Emily, then we could prove that Lionel has been illegally cloning people. What I don't get is if Emily could've escaped at any time... why wait till now for the sudden encore appearance? Maybe she found out she was gonna lose Lana forever. Then the question is, what would you do to keep someone from leaving?
But if we found Emily, then we could prove that Lionel has been illegally cloning people. What I don't get is if Emily could've escaped at any time... why wait till now for the sudden encore appearance? Maybe she found out she was gonna lose Lana forever. Then the question is, what would you do to keep someone from leaving? Try to make things go back to the way they were before.
Then the question is, what would you do to keep someone from leaving? Try to make things go back to the way they were before. You mean when they were kids? Emily still thinks Lana's her best friend... and everything can be like when they played together. You lived next door to Lana, do you remember them?
Smoke. Megan was screaming. She couldn't breathe. Clark, I had to warn her. Maybe we still can. Megan's house is just around the corner.
What's bothering you, son? When I went to pick up the vial for Vince, Lex was there. He was talking to one of the scientists. From their conversation, it sounds like Lionel Luthor is behind all of it. Now, why doesn't that surprise me?
I'll give you whatever samples you need. Look, even if your immune system could offer us some sort of insight, those kind of tests take months, years to analyze! No, no... He's right, Clark. We have a new antidote that we can test in a few hours. There's no time.
That I'll get behind that armor and finally uncover your secret? Clark. Last time I checked, this area is restricted. Hey, Lex. Sorry about just walking around. The outside door was unlocked.
I just had the car serviced. Watch what ya say. I gotta move that shit? Again? That developer's going up there.
And that's a good topic for section two in your outline. AJ! Wake up! I'm not going to do this by myself. How are you going to finish this paper? It's not going to write itself.
It should be Sexy News. Action News. Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good. Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on. Right.
All right, I'm going now The mountain lion! Hide! Go away! Shoo!
For as long as she was alive, your mother showed me a world beyond just ambition and career. She gave my life meaning and balance. It was my honour to love her for the short time she was with me. And if I were young again and I met her for the first time, even knowing her fate, I would do it all over again. That is love.
- Pretty much. - I think you're being a little modest. - Oh, I mean... Don't get me wrong. It's really rewarding. It really is.
You know, I, uh... I once did a piece on a war photographer. His name is Martin Krystovski. For about six months he was with a unit in Vietnam. The day before he was scheduled to leave - the day before - he's out with the unit. And it was just a routine patrol, or so they thought. But suddenly, the lieutenant pulled him down.
Bonny! Come on in here. Thank you. Good seeing you again. So!
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts. They call a child like that a Harsesis. - What happened to him? - He was saved by a very powerful being. He ascended to a higher plane of existence and, when he did, he gained great power himself.
It's impossible to predict what'll happen. I'm convinced that you will survive. But if you don't, I've programmed a failsafe mechanism to protect the city. - A failsafe? - Yes.
The results of the DNA test. It's a match. She is you. I know what you're thinking. If she's been waiting all these millennia for us to arrive, why didn't the system attempt to revive her the moment we got here?
Let us take that probe down, or we're all in deep trouble. Even if you were able to destroy it, more will come That is not true Why do you think they're here Sheppard? You. The Wraith have sensed a crop worth harvesting, and they've come to claim it.
We're too late! What the hell was that? It was too small to be a dart. It was a probe of some kind. Probably came to check out the signal from the Wraith bracelet.
This time around, all we need for it to do is to have enough energy to establish the briefest of connections By my calculations, approximately 3.5 microseconds. - That hardly seems like enough time to accomplish-- - General, when we first set foot on M5S224, before the wormhole shut down, I picked up fluctuations in the energy field. I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature, but having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation.
No, no, what I need to do now is get very agitated, because what I'm realizing is that all of this is a lie. This... And this... And this! What are you saying?
It's giving off a pretty strong life-signs reading. - I'm allergic to bee stings. - It smells the food. Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear. Well, let's leave it be...
If he doesn't, we're all dead anyway. No pressure. Major Sheppard would effectively be in suspended animation for the entire time. - We can't risk that. - Why not?
Just keep on it. There's still time. You should consider stepping into the event horizon. I'm serious. I'll keep trying till the end, but given your choices, that's a far better way to go. Leave you here alone with that thing wrapped up in my jacket?
Any food? You're kidding. I have less than 20 minutes to save our lives, and I am teetering on the brink of a hypoglycemic reaction, so.... Thank you I'm gonna try alcohol now.
- So if there's anything I can do for you.. - Actually, Fez, there is. When the bride tosses the bouquet, I really want to catch it. It's such a sweet and magical moment, so I need you to knock some of those fat sluts out of my way. I will make those weebles wobble.
What you do is you sit on a stoop and you chuck things at passersby. I was a pro. I was a passerby. Did you know that I am a shampoo boy down at the beauty salon? Yes, ladies come from miles around to be touched by these magic hands.
You don't get paid to be the best man. You do it for the satisfaction of nailing the hottest bridesmaid. It's in the bible. Well, I can't do that, 'cause I'm bringin' brooke. Yeah, we're getting pretty serious.
no, no! I noticed the candles getting lower, even though I'd never seen them lit! All right, this conversation is over! Wow So this is where it all happens.
- If I had known - Never call here again! - Kelso! - Well, I gotta keep the line open. I'm gonna kill you and mount your head on the TV.
I'm sorry. Here, you.. y.. y.. - You should probably just take this. - Thanks. Forman, would you quit depressing the strippers?
Hyde's sister after Kelso nailed her. Give me those. After you close up, do you wanna watch me eat a pizza? Look, Michael, I'm not sure we should see each other again. A lot of people have told me you're not very serious about the women you date, a lot of people... a lot, a lot... everybody.
For those of you who remember me... you know I'm not too good at giving speeches. But here goes. High school was a time... that pretty much sucked for most of us. Let's face it, it was all about being picked on or getting left out. But tonight I think we get the chance to change that. We can let bygones be bygones.
You wanna see them? You're overthinking this. When your dog dies, you don't make a list. You bury him, plant a shrub on top tell the kids he's running around a farm, and move on. That's actually a very apt metaphor. My failed marriage is like a dead dog.
The president doesn't want the impression we're strong-arming the region with European forces marching into Jerusalem under an American flag. This process will be executed by the Palestinian and Israeli governments. - We're there to help. - What if it turns out to be bigger? The president knows what he's getting into.
The U.S. is merely looking after its national interest as Israel has a right to do. Proliferation breeds proliferation. China's bomb produced India's, India's begat Pakistan's. The United States' ideal number of nuclear-weapons states is one. No matter if it's merited or arrogant, it's irrelevant.
- Get off the dance floor! Freestyle Jack, you go first Oh, Jackie. Jackie, please. Please! I love my rebound guy All right, I throw the dance!
Good conversation. A freewheeling exchange of ideas. Really ? And where were you during all of this ? Hi, did you get the flowers ? I did.
All I've ever done my whole life is clean up her mess. I just want a normal sister who I can count on. The only thing I can count on Janet for is a great connection to sleeping pills and all the lyrics to "Sugar Magnolia". I am with Grace. That girl's a leech.
Provided you remember who you're supposed to be working for. I'll catch you later. You gave me a character reference. Well, we can't have nutters like you roaming the streets. Didn't you want the job, didn't you?
Maybe the legislature, if the right seat opens up. But until then, I'm stuck in a job with no power except getting potholes filled. All due respect, Councilman, you're fucking with me because, what, you're bored? A little, yeah. And what the fuck.
- I've never heard of a Ray Logan. - Come on, Sean. - We know that the guy's your drug dealer. - I don't know what you're talking about. How's that transmission?
- You're welcome. - See? Everybody blames you. - So strange. Because I blame you. [ Scoffs ] Is that a fact? You needed to have that pancake?
- Can I have a pancake? - It would be my pleasure. - [ Sharon ] Oh, my God. Jaye's staying for pancakes? So? Hey, what happened to the cow creamer? Aaron broke it.

Well, whatever happened to,"I'm a little boy lost. Can you take me home ?" This is even better. I've befriended six girls in rocky relationships and when one of them crumbles, guess who they'll call ? Rebound guy.
Well, actually, it was just Patton. Man, that little guy can swing a hammer. Don't worry, I told him it was extra structural support for the ceiling. I think he very much wanted to believe that. All right, bob, this disturbing little contest of yours ends now.

It's given to few mortals to live happily ever after. Human beings can be almost children of the gods, they can fulfil every oracle, protected by the queen of the gods herself, but if you overstep the mark, if you fail to show due reverence, both to the gods and to your fellow human beings, if you break your most solemn vows, then fate will catch up with you and your true destiny will be revealed.

She told how the women of Lemnos had been cursed by the goddess of love, and how, as a result, their men had abandoned them for other women, and left the island. "So," she continued, "we invite you all to stay here with us "and if the prospect pleases you, "to come to our beds." 0f course, it sounds like another fairy story, but the tale of the Lemnian women was already well-known to Homer in the 8th century BC.

It's 12th century. - Is it? - Yes. They've given themselves away. So there you are. The 1191 excavation of King Arthur's body here at Glastonbury, without a shadow of doubt, was a fraud.
Everyone in the hall saw a drop of blood issue from the tip of the lance and the red drop ran right down to the boy's hand. Now a girl came in, fair and comely, and between her hands she held a grail. And when she carried the grail in, the hall was filled with a light so brilliant the candles lost their brightness - as do the moon or stars when the sun rises. And Perceval went to sleep longing to know the meaning of this vision and who was to be served from the grail. (W00D ) When Perceval woke, the castle was empty and the grail was gone and a quest began that has fascinated writers and filmmakers ever since.
It is the densest, drowsiest, thickest, perfumed scent that you ever imagined. There's one of the Roman writers, he says that people here, so many incense caravans came through, that the people became easy-going, drowsy with the beautiful scent of the incense. And here in the Yemen, there´s another tale of the Queen of Sheba. King Solomon could command even the djinns and spirits and he could talk to the birds.

Run him through the program. I did. It's no match. Well, we'll take it back to the FSG lab. We can clarify the photo.
Next... you need to get rid of where it's stored... the slow server. He did that when he blew up Greytech. Now, if you want to get really anal about it, - you take out the router hub. - What's that?
He did that when he blew up Greytech. Now, if you want to get really anal about it, - you take out the router hub. - What's that? Most people don't know this, but when you send a file on-line, it sits at a small router before moving on to a slow sever.

I'm gonna take it. I'm moving to New York. That's so... fucking horrible. What are you talking about? Two girls drinking soda pop, they don't want to be bothered.
I'm moving to New York. That's so... fucking horrible. What are you talking about? Two girls drinking soda pop, they don't want to be bothered. Two girls drinking beer, they're looking for witty conversation.
At least you'd be talking to a professional. -You ever been to therapy? -Of course not. I think women are great. Sweet little innocent creatures.
Some loser? I got the whole weekend. I can tell you everything you need to know. I'm talking about learning what a woman wants, from a woman. Finally, all these fucked-up relationships are gonna amount to something.
Nice talking to you there, Gretchen! Hey, Zack! Where's my bike? -What brilliant advice did she give you? -I'm not a good listener.
Two fun-Ioving college girls. Now the approach. What do you do? Say hello? That's why you're here.
I feel sorry for the girl that's going home with me tonight. I'm that sexy stranger you find lurking in the back of bars. You were drinking Cosmopolitans. Yeah, that's my drink. I'm the guy that asks himself in on the first date.

Well done my Chuyia. Do my feet now. Yes, Didi. Gently. My skin is like satin.
Last night was the first moon of the lunar cycle. Why can't you just download porn like other teenage boys? Excuse me for trying to make conversation. OK, so what would a werewolf be doing in LA? shouldn't it be off in the countryside somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?
Fuck! What the fuck is this? That was my armadillo. We've been tracking that all day. You totally wasted it. I'm sorry, man. I didn't see it.
I remember I was scared. It is full of magic both light... and dark. Our most powerful guardian spirit... lives in the Dark Water. It protects what our ancestors called... the nexus of all realities. The guardian has become very angry.
And when you've seen Tottington Hall before now, there's no way that it's anywhere near this big. But we just don't care at all, do we? We just make it as big as we want. It's real Tom and Jerry. I love that explosion.
I'm getting track marks. The third rule of time jumping: Don't bring anything back. What's rule number one? No matter how small, never change anything in the past.
Save the people from what I have done. I will. God wills it. Can you sense it? There has been no messenger.
When a body is burnt... it cannot be resurrected until Judgment Day. If we do not burn these bodies... we will all be dead of disease in three days. God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't... then he is not God, and we need not worry. Alaikum salaam. The wall, where the Christopher Gate used to be, has been weakened.
I hope you let me look inside because I'd really love to taste your treasure. Well, my treasure's under construction right now, so... Now, you. Excuse me, sir. A blue fucker, compliments of the young lady over there. Who's that?
I don't get it, Carrie. I mean, I gave my heart to Richard. What made him feel the need to have another woman? Well, that's easy. Penis insecurity.

Give her the flowers. Girls thought you might like those. No, they were your idea. They're my idea, but the girls thought you might like those. Well, they were right.
What's it been? Three to five years with time off for good behavior? Sharp, how are you? This is a church, all right? A place that's sacred.
You know the last thing Luis said to me before he died? What? He made me promise... that if anything ever happened to him, I would take care of you. You've grown up in Havana all your life, and I bet there's parts of the city you don't know at all. I'm sure you know them well. You know...
What? He made me promise... that if anything ever happened to him, I would take care of you. You've grown up in Havana all your life, and I bet there's parts of the city you don't know at all. I'm sure you know them well. You know... Havana's very much like a rose. It has petals, and it has thorns.
No sir, my family are Catholics, from Glasgow. I went to parish school A papist! Come to think of it, I haven't seen you at church. I must have imagined you were with your famous nautch girls.
Why do you ask? I need to know Company...? A Company is an entity created entirely for the purpose of making a profit And what does it do?
I need to know Company...? A Company is an entity created entirely for the purpose of making a profit And what does it do? - What does it do!
Meanwhile, the Behrampore Regiment must be stopped en route... and prevented from reaching Barrackpore. Halt! Ah, Bakht Khan! - Why this halt, sir? A storm is brewing.
Argh! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Stay back. Back. She's trying to escape.
You tell me, Grimmy. Who? Or she will die. It was the forest. German peasant.
By Jacob Grimm. Will. I'll kill you and take your eggs and smash them all in and... Spooky, spooky, spooky. I'm afraid my instruments aren't detecting much.
You didn't say what I was doing. You were shoveling snow. What? You were just a little girl in a flannel nightgown and you were shoveling snow from the walk in front of our house. And I was the snow.
Do you believe in nature versus nurture? Is that all a concern in terms of bringing a child into your house? - Not sure I follow you. - Why wouldn't we bring it into the house? Well, I just mean the gay thing. I mean, there's no irrefutable evidence one way or the other.
So am I to understand that with all the power of the Hand... that the Treasure continues to elude us? Yes. Perhaps if we had pursued it sooner... and more aggressively... You dare to blame Master Roshi? Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi. Not at all, sensei.
Got your... - Hi, son. - Are those my big-boy parts? They sure are. They're not shiny.
And though I hope you never have to use it... Thank you, sir, but I think I could be brave enough. I'm sure you could. But battles are ugly affairs. Susan.
Lee, you have guests. -Syd. -Leland. -Lee Janus. Those number crunchers can get a little overzealous, can't they?
- Give me a hand. Grab hold of my leg! - You've got strong legs. - Let go! Wow! Nice stone carvings.
And I'm sure Bob had that same thing. You just can't live through this. You live in your own little world and your own interests... but the outer world is definitely part of it. I didn't really know if that song was good or bad or... It felt right.
Die! Die! Die! Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long. In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar.
Frank. Frank. Try to focus. What's happening to Globodyne? - Globodyne? - Yeah, what happened, Frank? - We took our shifting losses... - Yeah? - ... and we put them into businesses...
Nice to meet you, too. Yeah. What? What does "uh-oh" mean? It looks like someone else is mowing your lawn, Fiona. I'm gonna go destroy these. Excuse me. I'll see you guys.
'Cause... okay. - No. So there I was sitting next to the Sultan of Brunei with Maureen Dowd, Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg. You know the story, Kevin. And... I said to Snoop, "Snoop, I think your lyrics are sometimes a little sexist and unfair to women." And the Sultan of Brunei said, "Really?
And can I read your file? Tell me why you're here. I thought you read the file. You torched your car. Why? I don't remember.
Seven more. I thought that was shatter proof. All right. I'm sorry, I just have to ask this, but are all of you okay with this? Well, I used to charge people a quarter... every time they asked us that question, but nobody could afford it.
It's rude to stare. Well so be it. You didn't need to take his head off. Well, I apologize. Well, it's embarrassing, Howard... Well I'm sorry...
That's the point. None of us are here. You're alone, by yourself... Close your eyes. All right?
- Thank you. You'll be back, pussycat. I know it. Don't bet on it, taco boy. Dude, you suck. You know that women don't like your macho comments.
This is gonna go a lot better. Why? Because I got you some bobtail arrows. They're easier. Why?
Did you know that I had children, too? A family? Then what do you really know about anything? Nothing. They found this when they cleaned out Red's place.
Excuse me. Yeah? Yeah, sorry. Excu— Excuse me. Sir, I've just got one question.
- Yeah? - You like that? It's interesting. Natalie, what would you do with 6.2 million dollars? - Should we check it? - Check it.
Considering the benefits my services could yield, I don't think that's unreasonable. And what are your services exactly? So I can be specific on the invoice. Whatever serves your interests. Fair enough.
I'm not too young, I'm 16! She had me when she was 1 7. Mothers! What can you do? They're all the same!
What's there to say? Why did you do it? Alice Malenfant, to write today... about abortion, about being a mother, sexism, isn't all that a bit dated? Absolutely not. are open to women.
It's ugly, huh? No, I'm ugly. I'm pathetic. Stop putting yourself down. I don't deserve to be pregnant, or even to be alive.
She's there with all the rest of them. The whole place is a morgue. He'll do the same to Sue Allen, if he gets his hands on her. You've got to stop him before he does any more killing. That look of horror spoils your lovely face.
They bring evil. They got evil powers. This is nonsense. What evil have they done to you? My child has raging fever, three days now.
It's nothing. It's, um... It's a... well, I had seen this thing. I drew it out for a guy. I designed a little...
Jack's name. Sarah's name? Stall? Tom Stall? Did you just make that up? Where did that name come from?
My gut tightens up. Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town. The cop shuts off his siren. He knows he's not the law, not in Old Town. The ladies are the law here, beautiful and merciless.
A goddamn hero cop. It's held for years, the shaky truce. The cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party. The girls get to administer their own brand of justice. They get to defend their own turf.
He kept smiling that damned smile. He made me watch, him suck the meat off my fingers. He made me watch! Oh, Jesus. He made me watch! Christ, I could use a cigarette. Dames.
We don't have time for these losers. You okay? Don't worry about them. They've been assholes forever. Seriously.
I know relationships are tough, but you you just do what you gotta do to keep it together, okay? Remember, love is sacrifice, I guess you're right, Okay, so you get tough, all right? And remember, this call is for entertainment purposes only,
That's what i need to do. Business. Are you going with us? We'll talk about business. No, I'll bring you but I won't stay. Anyhow, business is not my forte.
They're here for wood? It's like gold or diamonds to them. I guess their planet don't have no wood. They ship it back for profit. Supply and demand, you know?
This was the turning point where contests of wit were replaced by contests of chance. And that's what we have today. The sweepstakes where all you have to do is mail in your name and pray, or the lottery is the same thing. This Dr Pepper contest was basically the last contest of its kind. It got too expensive for the companies to hire all those judges to go through all the entry blanks.
that the horror could happen all over again. Here we go. We found this wonderful piece of music, Wheel Of Fortune, that we combined with the score. But you see, the scene suddenly turns. And this is what happens in real life.
A diuretic... It means you go number 1, not number 2. Listen, I'm... sorry about those Ersatz women. What? "Ersatz" means phony, something pretending to be something it's not.
One was a junkie, one was a crackhead one was like a junkie, and the other one was like a junkie. - Like, like, like! Did you know that the Lord of the Rings is gay? I beg your pardon? There's this big black tower, right?
My sophomore year, Nanny was diagnosed with breast cancer. When Death came by to visit Nanny, she told him, "God ain't done with me yet, so move on down the line." Stay on the speed limit. The year I graduated, we found out that Uncle Bill had lung cancer. Within six months, he was gone.
Then she said... "I'm just gonna tell you right now, just in case you ever wonder, I can handle my own honor... so your other arm is safe." Now when folks got North, Nanny would find them jobs, and if they didn't have nothing, she provided food, shelter, clothing.
I didn't have a clue what I wanted till I met you. Not a clue. Did you ever feel like you just want to you just want to start all over again? I guess it's easy for me to say because I don't have what you have. I'm not rooted like you are.
Can we work this out? Do you have something to say to me, Mr. Ipswitch? I'm sorry, Miss Hotchkiss. I'm sorry I brought my baggage to class. There are rules, Mr. Ipswitch, in life, just as there are rules in dance.
Oooouh. It's this monkey sound. You can almost imagine the Gods becoming frustrated, contemptuous. That with all this richness of spiritual concepts that are available, why reduce it to one plaintiff single note that the utterer does not even understand. The alchemists had two components to their philosophy. These were the principles of Solve et Coagula.

The alchemists had two components to their philosophy. These were the principles of Solve et Coagula. Solve was basically the equivalent of analysis, it was taking things apart to see how they worked.
Now if we're going to venture into this hypothetical and more or less entirely unknown territory, it would seem to only make sense that we should try and track down route maps that may have been made by previous explorers. Now when you're talking about the territory of the mind and perhaps the spirit, the only route maps available are magic systems from antiquity. You're talking about systems like the Quabalah, with its map of every conceivable human state. You're talking about systems like Tarot, a pantheon of archetypal images that provide the cartography for a map of the human condition. Most people find the word Apocalypse, to be a terrifying concept.
Robinson watched Friday shooting arrows at the sun. He picked a very long one - it was over than 6 feet long - and adorned with albatross feathers. He bent his bow with all his might and shot. The arrow rose up to at least 300 feet.
He picked a very long one - it was over than 6 feet long - and adorned with albatross feathers. He bent his bow with all his might and shot. The arrow rose up to at least 300 feet. At that point, it seemed to hesitate but instead of nose-diving into the beach, it flew toward the forest, blown by the wind.
Die, die, die! It's clear. All clear. Now... we mustn't sing or talk... or we'll spook the fairies... I have to see them.
No, that's a bad place. It's wrong there. No. Come on! Can't go there.
I made him come once just by sucking on his nipples. I didn't even have to touch his dick once. I love that I can tell you this shit. Because it's like it's off my chest, but it's still a secret, you know? Michelle's dad's got a gun.
And I'm not being cocky. I'm talking straight commerce with you, Mr. Novian. - I didn't come down here to bullshit you. - Wow, you got steamed. Or maybe a little inside information, maybe?
- She's a dentist. A dentist? Do you see her? Once a month, yeah, to get my brace checked. - Has she still got long hair?
A picture of Gerard, my son, when he was a lot younger, and my daughter when she was younger. Long before Deep Throat, Damiano was a family man. He and his wife ran a beauty salon in Queens, New York. I enjoyed being a hairdresser because I always could relate to women. After you got to know the woman, especially when you worked on them weekly, you start to get into history about "we went to the movies" and "he did this and I did... "
My name is Dr. Morris Rosengarden. They would show sexual scenes, but they couldn't be accused of pornography because it had an educational value. Some men find their wives' buttocks very stimulating visually. We needed a father figure for almost everything. This may be uncomfortable for the obese or older couples.
I'm sorry, that's just all they are. They don't even believe that there is any law. How do you communicate to those persons that this is against the law? I face five years in jail. Do I belong in jail for five years for acting in Deep Throat, which is not in violation of the law?
Well, that's good for you. I know. Have you heard of a Barker's basket? Listen, we lost him. George, what happened?
I can send 50 men against that thing... and they'd come back in body bags. Now, Cholo was your man. Maybe you can get close enough to do what has to be done. It's a good thing I'm still in town. See, I bought a car.
Barry keeps calling me. I'll tell him I'll come when Joel will travel. I do not think it is a good idea. The summer was over. I could feel it.
It was coming to the boil as we came in. Here. I always like to tell the truth. seeing you sitting here at night alone with me, drinking coffee, it makes my heart race. You're so beautiful!
Very nice... Peaceful, the estate agent told me. How did you find me? Easy for Special Missions. You haven't come 400 miles to savor such a minor success. I have a mission.
In really fun colors. Expecting nothing by the way. They culled their money together, whatever they call it. And bought a stamp and sent me a postcard, thanking me. And it's a, you know, "Thank you". That they had enough sweaters for every single member of the village to get one. And that they were delicious.
Oh my God, that's so cool. What's going on with you? What about that pilot? - I got it. - Awesome.
Not like this. Alright. I'll do it. I got what it takes. Got what it needs. Got what a show needs. I, I'll show them all, little old me. I'm what the world needs.

I was glad Arnaud reacted so well. It can't be easy. It can't be easy for Alban. Yes, but what can you do? With his extra testicle... I've been honest. I always warned his girlfriends in advance.
Is that gesture how you reference when you reference madness? The last supper, -the last supper of Jesus, -Yes. in that one in the John's Gospel, and he found the only hierarchy possible of his life, and which is a hierarchy of love. That is to say, he wants, just yearns, to live in the heart of his own friends there.
Okay, last, of course. All right. Keep the cheetah locked up. That up ahead is called the Great Expectation Room. In there.
Only it doesn't sink. It's slippery for me. It's an old white couple. They've been married for, like, 40 years, and they found this house which they took as a sign. So they said, "We will piece this house together
- No, not even then. What we have to discuss is the consequences of our decisions. If the company asked you, would you do something illegal? I would pick Julio, and I'll tell you why. In the end what matters for a company are the results of our decisions.
Though they can be aggressive during the rest of the year at this time the males are totally docile. A united and cooperative team they brace against the storm by merging their thousand bodies into a single mass. They will take turns each of them getting to spend some time near the center of their huddle where it's warmer. As they move about the fathers will balance their eggs like tightrope walkers. The exhausted mothers have marched 70 miles.

The exhausted mothers have marched 70 miles. They are now back where they started three months ago. But they aren't anywhere near the water's edge. New ice is formed along the shore forcing them to walk several more miles before they reach the sea. Food is actually only a few inches below them.
- I tried. Two months ago. I sent Chloe to see her. Money in hand. She sent it back. - Then she does mean to torment you. - Until I die.
After the death taking place the company can't run any more risks. I'm not speaking too fast, am I? - No, I understand you. The problem is the noise. Boom, boom, the noise of the pumping. There are places where you hardly notice it. It's no where to go on holiday, although...
- It's gone. It's gone. - What? - What is? - There was a big sailing ship. - Y'all didn't see that ship? - No.
He wanted us to know the story, or at least a part of it. Am I to understand that you have read this document, inspector? - Has anyone else read it? - No, sir. - Then let me make this perfectly clear to you. The contents of this document are a matter of national security constituting an assault on the character of several important party members as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.
A separate report has been filed suggesting a train, despite the fact that the tunnels surrounding Parliament have been sealed shut. Who filed that report? Chief Inspector Finch. Do you have any evidence to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch? No, sir. Just a feeling.
And I won't even ask who it is. The question is simply this: Do we count on the silence of the man in question, or will he harm you in your friends' eyes? I believe this man, if he is a man of the world, will remain silent. But your girls, who live off the crumbs of your life, will get ideas in their head.
Couple days, maybe? Like a week. We have been living off these chocolate PowerBars since it started. Since what started? Everything.
When I was in a Pentagon, when we got hit, you know, yes it did change. It was a very dramatic and terrible thing. And it does change the perspective. But the war in Iraq had nothing to do with war on terrorism. There was a huge leap, a manufactured leap. In order to implement a very calculated and predeveloped foreign policy.
Perfect, now we've never met before, no collusion. Which is really odd, because collusion is our business. Yes, collusion with the military. You know, people sometimes think of the defense budget as you got to arm the troops, defend the nation. But for most people who are involved in that, you realize this is business. Competition for contracts between very large corporations. Industry has to have a bottom line that's black, otherwise their shareholders don't like that.
There was a moment when the entire world was behind us. There was a million people, demonstrating in the streets of Teheran in favor of the United States. We had the world behind us. Now kids are dying. Billions are being spent every month.
But you said we die. For the future, for the human race. Yes, because there are laws. There are laws of time. Once upon a time, there were people in charge of those laws, but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? Me!
Marvellous. But every single drop is filtered. It's screened, it's safe. Looks like it, yeah. If something was frozen down there, a viral life form out in the ice for all those years... Look at her mouth. All blackened like there's some sort of fission.
Look. I love watching pregnant women. It's lovely. I can guess the shape of their tits. A pregnant woman's tits are lovely.
We spend practically all our time on the road. So we're potentially in danger practically all the time. That's why the boss and I have decided to bring you here to hold a... an advanced driving course. Your instructors and myself, as I've often done this course... You'll have a chance to familiarise yourself with all the little traps on the road that can lead to a skid. What's a skid?
What, Mom? This... Mom, did you read it? Why? You shouldn't have.
Why? You shouldn't have. But those things you wrote, are they true? Not now, please, I'm asking you. Please.
You shouldn't have. But those things you wrote, are they true? Not now, please, I'm asking you. Please. Are they true or not?
But those things you wrote, are they true? Not now, please, I'm asking you. Please. Are they true or not? And if they're not how did you ever imagine them?
There's a whole lovers' code: A small yellow one means you're just good friends. A big red one means you're wildly in love. And regular melons, despite their small size, are reserved for the most ardent passion! Here you see a group of students, too shy to declare their love, going out with "guardian angels" friends dressed as watermelons to deliver watermelons to the girls' dormitories.

it's your own fault. Look here they come hot and sexy They're keen, I'll bet See the smoke from our cigarettes fill the air It rises higher still and its perfume lingers there
Is hould have sent you home when I found you... crying in the toilets. You need to clear your head. You're off duty for the rest of the month. How many women are going to die before you're willing to... pull your finger out of your ass? Don't talk to me like that Phillip.
I'll be right in. I know about you. Okay, you got me. Put the cuffs on now, Your Honor. I gave my women to o many calories and made them fat.
Mate you know what could happen if something goes wrong. Fuck you too, Nig. Fucking ass hole. God forgives people who make mistakes but I'm pretty sure... He doesn't forgive people who stand by while... His most important commandment gets broken. The thing is, Mary. All these women... All these women used to be on the website.
I drove. You wanna use my car? Your car? Why not? So how is this shit? It's pretty good?
Fucking ugly. You'd think they'd have something to take the edge off a chick leaving you. That'd be nice. Look, they have this theory. Maybe it'll help. I don't know.
Some foreigners love to spend money, but others are trickier. You don't want to waste your time with the stingy ones. So you have to work out whether they can afford you. Try asking the time. Then you can check out his watch real or fake?
It is someone you know. Now all we can do is wait. As the evil grows stronger it will take physical form. We must find out where this girl is living. Each night the evil will leave the girl and hunt.
that it was exclusive to the '70' s, although certainly the air of freedom made it easier for him to do what he did. I started my film in '72 and that was exactly when I was 30 years old. So I started my career... even that people would say my God, the career's already over. Peter Berlin was never young. Yes, I mean he never was
Oh, how long you have been here? Do you like it? And after I go through this 20 times, even the faces look all the same. I naturally get tired of it because I know exactly what they really are interested in. And it all happened in San Francisco.
Nut-nugat, chocolate-nugat, nuts, turkish honey, Muskateller and... a couple boxes fried almods. - Enough! Hold your mouth, goddamn! Goddamn. I tell you where the money is.
It was made by hands that have ki I led! I 'm tel I ing you I ki I led him How many times do I have to tel I you? Then tel I me what that marble looked I ike What?
They took the picture as a joke. You published it out of context, without-- Guys. I've got another ghost story. That wasn't a ghost story, Mindy. It's an urban legend.
You don't know.. You don't know.. Here is wishing Mr. and Mrs. Bothello a very happy anniversary. Ladies and Gentlemen: let's give them a big hand!
I can't believe you turn me down like this. You should learn to read the market trend. Take care. - Is this your boss' plant? - Yes.
Good morning. I just couldn't get Bonaparte to calm down last night. I was going to call... Are those flowers a peace offering? No. For the cemetery.
He was a big guy. Well, sometimes I jerk off thinking about Vanessa. But now that I know she has a hot daughter, did you take any pictures? No, no. But if you could ever do it with her daughter. Careful. Shit, you could end up in jail, she's a minor. Those laws haven't been thought properly.
No, no. But if you could ever do it with her daughter. Careful. Shit, you could end up in jail, she's a minor. Those laws haven't been thought properly. Most of these girls go out more when they're 15 than you and I at 30, they smoke, they drink, they take drugs tattoos, they pierce their tongue... And their clit.

So, if they can hold a cigarette in their hand, they can also hold a dick.
Yeah, a river of slime from your house to the lift, all down the stairs and to the rubbish container. Disgusting! And then you'd go in the lift... And a puddle of shit inside, someone would walk in: splash, splash. Then he'd go home open the door, Splash, splash, and your shit was all over the building, in every house. That's why supermarkets brought out these bags, which had super resistant handles and you could tie them super-tight.
Fuckin' Vietnam? So, why did she dump you? I don't know. She said she needed time to think, time to be with herself, time for... Women are obsessed with time.
- Are you really saying this ? One afternoon you meet five girls: next morning you've married one of them And I'm regretting it now. You don't know these girls ! Firstly, their logic switch is permanently off.
Tell me, if you want to live. Well, I don't fuckin' care whether you tell me or not. A? AB? A?
You need to get serious... Follow his orders no matter what. Whatever they are. Uncle! You know what I'm gonna say, so just do it or quit!
she told good jokes, multiorgasmic, good memory, good voice, good teeth, she beats me at ping pong and at chess. She know s all the capitals, even the African ones. She makes her own clothes and cuts her hair. Wonderwoman...
Yeah, poor children. It doesn't have to be like that. I'm not lazy. That's how it is. Things are not that complicated.
OK, tell me something. Last night, a moth got into my mouth. Did you swallow it? No, I still have it inside. Show it to me!
Last night, a moth got into my mouth. Did you swallow it? No, I still have it inside. Show it to me! If I show it, it will fly aw ay.
The strong ones, w e get there. We get where? Wherever w e're going, damn it! Forward, w e're alw ays moving forw ard. A cruel world has condemned me
No weapons ? No power ? The message on the artifact. Raux, search on Sukaal. Master Sukaal. My mission was successful.
Good God! But what is she doing? Slow ... Damn, Cheryl! You want to kill me or what?
While you are under this roof, I forbid you to blaspheme. Shut up and impale yourself on me. Hide me this stuff! So what did you do these girls? Why should I have killed?
It was not a real doctor. It does not bother me. It was a sorcerer. It was black magic. Voodoo is common practice since the 18th century, when slaves found themselves in Beauregard Square.
Give it to Ophelia. It will be a good breast. As calibrated, like son. Then you ... Who wants a cocktail sausage?
No one has ever really seen one. The more beautiful a woman, the more qualities you think she has. Jack, you should see montreal in the spring. The women are so beautiful your head spins. The most beautiful in the world!
What were the guards doing? Just put out the fire! Save the paper first! Go and save the paper! Day 1
Did you guess the answer? Yes, we can't accept even a grain of barley. Why is that? The landowner has supplies of emergency grain. A true person of the people must show mercy to the farmers.
Yes, we can't accept even a grain of barley. Why is that? The landowner has supplies of emergency grain. A true person of the people must show mercy to the farmers. A farmer feeds his cow, even if it can't complete its work.
Set it down. So according to the shaman, this wound is from lightning. Judging from its small size, it was a flint gun, not a rifle. She died 3 days before the ritual, so it's been 10 days. In this heat, how did her body remain so fresh?
They were seemingly happy. However... The mother was smart and polite. The father was hard-working. But he didn´t try to understand his daughters. Their individuality.
I was there too, right? Aye. In the flesh. So it ain't the Yotsuya ghost, huh? Then the next thing I know two doors floated by.
The same as me? Souls separated from their flesh. They cross the River Styx. And vanish in the darkness. Cheers!
This is my pleasure team. Who goes there? Poor  <hon>girls<hoff>. They died because of me. Hey, Datsueba.
Do as I say in my place. Got that? - Screw you. - Sure, no problem. This house has been vacant since the barbarians' attack.
Baghdad is sad. I can't look I would like to be blind so I wouldn't have to see them. I don't want to see them in front of my eyes. It's as if they were walking over me, over my feelings. I hope that no woman and mother in the world experiences what the Iraqis and their children have experienced.
Ashes... everything... The American forces have destroyed our home. Everything has disappeared we were just able to get out ourselves. The Americans came and said: "It's a fact of war".
Cool. Shall we get a room? Not like that stupid! You have to win over my heart! You have to write poems praising my beauty and then sing them for me like songs of love.
What are you saying Neal? Mom and Dad actually got it right? Damn, I wish this was as simple as buying a car. Actually, when buying a car, you can test drive it. You can check how to handle it, its power, it's smoothness
She passed out in front of the elevator. And when she came to, there was nothing. Better not believe every word she says. The ghost remembers only what it wants to. So you're saying... The music teacher and Young-eon were lovers.
- Whose voice was it? - I don't know. How you hear her voice... Aren't you curious? A ghost can have a voice with a strong attachment.
Fight, or tell us right now why you think our sweethearts capable of infidelity. Sweet naivety, how charming you are. Stop joking, or I swear by heaven... And I swear by earth I am not joking, my friends. Just tell me what kind of creatures these beauties of yours are.
Sweet naivety, how charming you are. Stop joking, or I swear by heaven... And I swear by earth I am not joking, my friends. Just tell me what kind of creatures these beauties of yours are. Are they, like us, made of flesh, bones and skin?
Stop joking, or I swear by heaven... And I swear by earth I am not joking, my friends. Just tell me what kind of creatures these beauties of yours are. Are they, like us, made of flesh, bones and skin? Do they eat like us? Do they wear petticoats?
We can fight at their sides, and die, if need be. Go to the devil, hateful ornament, I detest you! Could there ever be a love like this? Do not hope to present yourself to me until I return with my beloved. In your place I'll put on this hat.
See you around, Stuart. George. Boy, she's a piece of work. She sure is. Does she really expect us to believe some crazy story about a beast?
-Could have been better. -Good try. I would have made it. But there was this giant fish. It was a shark.
Forget the land and the.. ..machinery for that amount I will not even sell you the dust of GG city! If the CM is going to Rishivan then we will also go along with him. We stood at this very place and you had said to wait for just 1 year. Now it's a year and what do you have to say?
So don't buy a ticket. Let's go. 75 million. 100 million. Take your finger, clean the wax out of your ears and listen carefully.
I want my father back. Boss, I learned one lesson from my father. Each of us has that one thing we cannot afford to lose. You can lose everything else but you must not lose not that one invaluable thing. You can spend your entire life in defense of it.
Hold this goat for me for a sec. Mallam! Be right there. I come. You got it lying down already?
I still hope the old furnaces... will be preserved as museum pieces. After all, they represent Angang history. The first row of blast furnaces was left here by the Japanese. Half a century has gone by since then. They bear testimony of our past.
Yeah. The government belongs to me! And my fire is the best! How do you like this job? This job wears me out.
Yes. You must be asking yourself what I'm doing here at this time. I'm not sure if we're that close, neither what you think about me. I'm a man who has always lived life in the third person. Until recently... Not really long ago... before seeing you, hearing your words... I was someone who lived life in a simple manner.
But now I'm appealing... to try to prove it wasn't me who killed him. DANIELA CABRAL 19 YEARS OLD FIRST-TIME OFFENDER They took me to the selection, they told me to wait in there... before going up to the gallery. I didn't go up to the gallery because the other prisoners... don't accept this kind of crime.
They took me to the selection, they told me to wait in there... before going up to the gallery. I didn't go up to the gallery because the other prisoners... don't accept this kind of crime. If they know it, they'll come to me... they will, I don't know, they'll even want to kill me. Because I can't prove I didn't do it. They think I did.
Then she told me, "Daniela, don't go to the door hatch. If they call you, saying it's an agent... don't go near the hatch. " Because they can throw hot water at her. They threatened to do that when she was in the nursery... they said they'd throw hot water, and they do... and told her never to leave cell without an agent escorting her. She told me that, if they come... that, in jail, I have to defend myself.
There's no equivalent. There is no single figure who manages so much of the media, so much real power... not virtual power. That doesn't exist so I've never been able to write about it. For me, TVjournalism doesn't mean talking about cheese... or giving the microphone to whoever's in power at the moment. Journalism is independent, it means asking questions. And, above all, following up on them.
This is an old Chinese poem. It's beautiful, heartbreaking poetry, but it's not on any tests. It seems the poet wrote it after the death of his beloved. Even though mankind seems to have made great progress, In the human heart, deep within, there hasn't been much change. This poem was written about 2,000 years ago.
Stop trying to be clever, idiot. Hey! Lara! So who's better? Man-taek's fishy.
Floats endlessly Now, Guiga, you're going to play the piano. Give me your little hand. Your thumb on C. Nandinha was a boarder in Mercês College against her wish.
And Getúlio, man? He just disappeared. I want to learn the guitar... but this is for later. To get some money, I'm gonna give some yoga classes... or sell veggie sandwiches on the beach. I'm going to Chapada. There's a community there.
This letter breaks that silence It marks the first of my three hundred and sixty five letters to you One for each day of silence I will never be more myself, than in these letters They are my maps of the bird path
Glad to be here. Not so fast! Anyway... what is that time machine? Are you that advanced? We don't understand it, either. You don't?
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position as head of Field Ops until we avert this crisis. Whatever I can do to help. Let me make one thing clear. Ronnie was under my command, and you will be, too. Understood.
Jack, CTU believes the detonation of this warhead is imminent. Can you force him to talk immediately? I don't think so. I think the fastest way to make this happen- give him what he wants. Okay.
She says she doesn't know anything about him, but they're about to get into the computer files. That might help us find the override. Okay, thanks, Erin. It's right down this hall and to the left. Stay alert.
NTSP have arrived at the scene and are investigating the cause. At this time, the authorities are not saying whether this was an accident or a targetted attack but as you can there has been a... So far, everything is on schedule. Have yo spoken to Thomas? Yes, the briefcase is on its way to us now.
- It's Tomas. - Did Dar get the briefcase? Yes, he's on his way to you now. So far, everything is on schedule. The briefcase is on its way to us now.
I told him i wasn't interested. Can you describe the weapon, mr. Kovec ? I watched him put that sucker together. .50 caliber. Never saw bullets so big.
Look, alana, i don't know how long it's going to take For us to get out of here. I don't know. Who says we will? You keep talking about that door. It's been a month already.
He's gonna die. Jordan collier? Someone's going to kill him. No! No!
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out. How do you do that? I study them. Sometimes. there's a light in their eyes.
I do my best work when i eliminate sleep altogether. Well, if you need someone to splash cold water on your face, you just let me know. Thanks. Do you mind? I noticed that missing page made its way back in. Oh. Yeah.
I'll send them down. Mr. Navarro? I'm agent skouris. This is agent-- Please... please,don't talk. It's too noisy.
(Jack) Thomas Grace? Who wants to know? Let's take a walk. Did you know that we have astronaut ice cream here? The Neapolitan is a little nasty.
I believe that if the two of you go out on this mission, and Anna Espinosa has her way, that only one of you will return home alive. It's been 24 hours. Sark's tracker is still dark. I know.
Hey. Vaughn, what I said to you, what I did... Syd, you weren't yourself. No. My father liked spiders.
I don't find Nocturne. At least not what they make today. So what did you give Cahill? Old sample. It was meant to be destroyed.
Even better. Idiot. Uh-oh. What do you mean, "uh-oh?" I dropped my lipstick.
You're a go. Anyone have a visual on the scientist? He's holding court, due east. That was easy. Okay, Merlin, showtime.
- What are you doing here? - Duh. It's Wednesday, our grocery shopping day? Isn't that crazy? I thought my boring routine was killing me.
This is Fussy. His ownerwas killed, and he needs a home. No way, Francine! We're Smiths. And Smiths have manly dogs. This dog couldn't be any more effeminate, even ifit had 20 vaginas.
Everything that happens from this point on is just gravy. My dad was paralyzed in a gun accident... and he has something to say about it. - Tell 'em, Dad. - I will, Hayley. Gentlemen, my body is lifeless, but my brain still works.
Yeh, what of it? Nothing, congratulations. Stop those fireballs! It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack.
One of those things put two rounds into my father's chest. We have found Kobol, And when we retrieve the Arrow, we will open the Tomb of Athena, and we will find the road to Earth. What I need to know... is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena. I can show you the path.
We was looking for weapons of mass destruction. Did you ever find 'em? You know goddamn well we ain't find 'em! What are you? Some political humorist? You Garry Trudeau up in this bitch?
Uh... so I understand you just got back from Iraq. For real? Yo, what's it like? What's it like? What I supposed to say to that? It was cool, there was bitches?
I need to show that what happened in Washington was an isolated... What? Don't go near the Washington case. It's possible it wasn't even a downer cow. What do you mean, "downer cow?" Basically, it means the cow fell down.
But that would make us... a nation of nansy-pansies. I don't know about you, but... I don't want to be a nansy-pansy. Towns make rules all the time. Lots of them. Zone fast food restaurants out ofbusiness.
But why wait? That's the mayor's jingle. Why wait? Because this man and others like him... have sacrificed their lives and their livelihoods... building their restaurants. Maybe, as a courtesy... we could wait for a scintilla of evidence... before arbitrarily destroying their businesses.
Awfully tiny cigar. It's the kind of cigar that goes along with our wimpy defense today. Denise and I were discussing it. We think you're right. We think maybe... maybe our approach should be... guns are good.
This court is satisfied that the representation was adequate. Is there anything else? Yes, Mr. Borns may be innocent. The jury disagreed, and legally, that issue has been settled. The DNA evidence shows somebody else was there.
- Well, assuming she passes the psychiatric test... and is deemed competent for trial. How can you get to a murder trial in a week? Well, there are no facts in dispute. It comes down to justification only. Paul, we can't let this case drag on.
–What can you tell us about perspective? –Objection. –That's a question! –Sustained. –The brother told you about the priest? –Yes. And that's when you went to the church and cut off his fingers?
–After what they've done to me! Perhaps you should tell me exactly what they've done to you. My credit card bills. You're aware I have some uh, fiscal issues? It's come up.
We simply don't seem to care. Well, she does. She's in this courtroom honoring one dead soldier. That's a start. We're dealing here with a pageant in a public school.
The answer is no. I can easily get a court order with what I've got. So, get one. Let's go. Jill ?
My opinion is it's the same writer. Well, it looks like the Vladski tricked the Kenski. According to your credit card statements, you purchased several buckets of tar two and five years ago... at a local hardware store. Tell me, what's a receptionist at a hair salon doing with that much tar ? In Russia, I work for certain family.
They told me you dug up two bodies covered in tar ? So. How you going to separate them ? I'm not sure yet. Obviously I can't saw through without potentially destroying evidence, so... If the tar were harder, I could chisel it.
You may be seated. Dr. Grissom, you've had a chance to review Dr. Thayer's tape and associated evidence, is that correct? Do you agree with his finding that Joanna Whitson was murdered 15 days before her body was discovered? Can you please elaborate? Our crime lab analyzed fly larvae that was taken from the pig used by Dr. Thayer in his demonstration.
Tia, can I speak with you, please ? What's up ? Just take a look. That's your print. Why'd you pour the cooking fuel in there, Tia ?
Let's go. Bingo. Eric. That car was definitely tampered with. This switch was part of a small assembly rigged to the cruise control.
Right, I understand, but I think right now, the most important thing is to find that boy. Wouldn't you agree? Not if it means undermining this entire case. I have ethical problems with this type of behavior. Are you questioning my conduct?
Page definitely corresponds to a location in Dade County. Yeah, factoring in the soil evidence from the shovel, he's pointing us to a wetlands area in Homestead. All right, I'll meet you there. Underground scanning. What branch of the military did we get this from?
Gearshift's got a print. AFIS is going to have a hard time with this one. Print's smudged. There's not much ridge detail. Killer would have had to move fast.
I don't know why you just don't go talk to them. I mean, you're, like, 30 feet away. It's not a date. Besides, I'd rather just cut to the chase. You tooth all these girls ?
They're "eight penny" nails. Two and a half inches long. So is there any way to determine whether or not that's the murder weapon ? Do nails have striations ? No, but they do have tool marks.
That is not what you think. What do I think? You're twisting it, making it dirty. I'm just being honest. You haven't been honest with us yet.
Better than nice; like vanilla. Not bad. In fact, it's vanilla. - Really ? - Yeah.
- Yeah, dyes are different leaving me with a lone gray fiber... of unknown origin pulled from the gill of a swordfish, no less. Fiber that may or may not have anything to do with Fred Bayliss'murder. Yet, it's my only lead. So why don't you give me some good news, please ? Sorry...
There's no question. She burned down the mission. She killed those kids. Innocent people don't drive out to the middle of nowhere to burn their clothes. It had to be what she was wearing that night.
You realize the combined force of good and evil is our only chance of stopping the Avatars. We gave you the world you asked for. Except for the fact that you were killing people. Put the world back. Are you a whitelighter?
Well, that'll all change. Until tomorrow, everyone! - What's going on? - Bye! Ta-ta!
- No, we have time. - How do you figure? It's over, Zankou. We don't stand a chance in this world. Still, we planted a seed.
It's not just about the girls. It's about Sheridan. What about Sheridan? I know she's investigating the girls. But keep her away from the house. Something big is gonna go down.
You know ? Look, we're just a little out of sync, that's all. It happens. You know, there's nothing wrong getting some outside help once in a while. We owe it to ourselves. Flowers are not so much different from marriages, really.
OK, we trust him, he trusts us. I'm gonna go talk to him, see what he knows, and, uh... I'll call you. OK ? The whitelighter way ? No, Sam, the regular way.
Yeah, it's not that unusual. You'd be surprised at the number of women out here who turn absolutely platinum with grief. You can see it's not for eveningwear, but it's just glamorous for lunch. She was starving herself to fit into it and wearing it out the door. Ok. These two are for you.
You'd be surprised at the number of women out here who turn absolutely platinum with grief. You can see it's not for eveningwear, but it's just glamorous for lunch. She was starving herself to fit into it and wearing it out the door. Ok. These two are for you. Appropriate for funerals, but I think they could also double up for evenings out.
Now, you see how similar the roots of the teeth are? The height of the bone, the absence of filling. And with Flynn pushing me. What would be the benefit of more time, doctor? Well, for one thing, i might have found Lisa Barnes' more recent x-rays.
We are happy with the way things are. Actually, you know, Roy was still married at your wedding. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, my wife Lisa was declared dead, ok? I have the death certificate. So do i.
So the knife was yours, wasn't it? Yeah, it was mine. So what? I was a kid, I got it for part of a costume. You need a 10 inch steak knife for a Halloween costume?
I just saw you have the key to my apartment on your key ring Where'd you get this? You give it to me, when I start the job No I gave you the key to the deli I never gave you the key to my home
- I can stay - Oh, you gotta be kidding me Why is Stump even here? I thought you said we were gonna hang after you saw your dad He said King's in pretty bad shape
First your brother and now Scott. That's fine. But when push comes to shove you gotta save yourself. - He's my partner. - Amy, your company is like a hot air balloon. It's rising, it's way up.
Sorry, it's just, you know- I've been waiting since you were eating your salad, you know? I know. No, it's not your fault. * the phone rings in the middle of the night... * * my father yells... * You know maybe the key was mistagged.
Look,alex,every world leader is watching this summit looking for clues,gestures, whatever signals they can read to figure out what kind of a president mackenzie allen is besides female. Mrs. Benjamin harrison started the collection of china. I especially like this-- rococo-revival punch bowl from the pierce administration. Mrs. Harrison actually found this bowl in the,uh, white house attic. And had it mended and then... put on display.
She's not a lap dog. She's a doberman pinscher and she doesn't like the leash you got on her The stuff you've given her to do would make walter mondale's vice presidency look activist You need to give her something that she can get her teeth into without making you bleed. You've got to recognize something useful in her She's a woman
Let me carry you downstairs. Oh, Nate, look, don't you worry about me. I'll be fine. Don't worry. Don't worry, It's my fault I wore suede.
Somebody's got to give him a better name. He uses your bombs, your designs. Well, he should be careful. Those things are dangerous. Adrian... you can't fool me.
- No no no, what did you think? Well, you know, you said, "we need to talk." Generally, when couples break up, that's how they introduce it, you know, "we need to talk." - So I just thought it was... - Well, why would you... why would you even think that?
Well, you know, the fact that she's been with women before you. - I know... - I'd be really intimidated by that, because, you know, we really... - Intimidated? Well, because we don't know what we're doing as much as the women know.
"Puffy shirt" is my favorite episode. You know what? I love that show. - Really? - That's one of my favorite episodes.
- Bye bye. The Playboy mansion? That's where you were? You didn't think that I would mind that you're running around with nude women? There's no nude women.
- Nice talking to you. - People who are alive they need the... What do you think you're doing? What? You pull that plug and I'll tell.
What do you know about the place that was here before ? Brockmore ? State run mental health facility. Closed down in '79. Victim of fiscal reform.
Then, this one year, for Christmas, my Dad, he bought me a new mitt. I couldn't wait to get out and shag some flies. You see... Bibles ! They are like that new mitt:
Didn't you ? I mean tell me I'm wrong and I'm walking away. I have to protect this baby Sarah. Okay. I had a vision.
It was on the mother's jacket. It got wet. Ink's all smeared. Looks like a letter. I am counting the days 'til I see you and Miguelito again.
How much they depend on you. Never thought I'd be doing this alone... Hello. Walt. We're pretty sure that the van was stolen out of Boston.
You, little girl trying to cross the border with your mother. A frightened little girl hanging on to life. Shut up. You sat there for two days... and brushed the flies away from your dead mother, praying that someone would come. Someone would come to save you.
Bidding's open always on everyone, Miss Isringhausen. But I expect you understand, knowing as I do... should Mrs Garret lose her claim, rather than operate it themselves... her cunt in-laws will sell to third party cocksuckers inimical... to the whole of my interests in this camp! To buy my allegiance against myself... in-law cunts... and shitheel operators would have to bid very high indeed. No, more likely, Miss Isringhausen, I think you'd contemplate... changing your allegiance before I would mine. What benefit would I consider might accrue to me?
If a bird taps on a window or crashes into one... that means that there has been a death! We know there's been a death. We know now, but that bird crashed into the window... and died a while ago, before we knew... for all we know. I've shined me and Al's, but I ain't doing yours. Oh, well, I got me some new boots.
But not everyone... Call 911 and tell them you got the killer locked up in the basement! He is not a killer. ...got what they deserved. It is often said that Necessity is the mother of Invention.
OK, it's not funny. Actually, I wanted to see if you were aware that you gave me back the Valentine's Day card. I was aware, yeah. Oh. Well --
Look -- I'll agree with Dr Goldfine on one thing. We should slow things down. Really? Yes.
He's a great guy. But you know, I mean, he's a little buster brown. Don't you ever worry you're going to get bored? Thanks for your concern, Karl. I'm fine. Go figure.
Well, I don't hate her. If you want me to share stuff with you, be more supportive of Susan. OK. How? What do friends do? They call.
Get up. Get dressed. - Why? - You're coming with me. It's time to get wasted. Happy Hour started 45 minutes ago. Why would I go anywhere with you?
- Why? - You're coming with me. It's time to get wasted. Happy Hour started 45 minutes ago. Why would I go anywhere with you? That's what normal women do when they get depressed.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may take a moment during this terrible time. It's hardly the Queen's speech. I'm afraid that's been cancelled. Did we ask about the Royal Family? they're on the roof.

It's a gift of the Tardis. Telepathic field, gets inside your brain, translates. It's inside MY brain? Well, in a good way. Your machine gets inside my head?
Perhaps you could tell a story or two. Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing else left...? I scanned you earlier. The metalmachine had trouble identifying your species. It refused to admit your existence.
I'm sorry. But you've got one of the best minds in the world and you saw those gas creatures. I cannot accept that. And what does the human body do, when it decomposes? It breaks down. Produces gas.
Oh, come on, Charles. All right, I shouldn't have told you to shut up. I'm sorry. But you've got one of the best minds in the world and you saw those gas creatures. I cannot accept that.
I cannot accept that. And what does the human body do, when it decomposes? It breaks down. Produces gas. Perfect home for these gas-things, they can slip inside, use it as a vehicle. Just like your driver and his coach.
Failing! Atmosphere hostile! Gas! The gas! But it's 1869, how can I die now?
And they compensate you? A small stipend for my time. - Hope your malpractice premiums are paid. - There's nothing wrong with it. I am reimbursed for helping monitor a drug by doing thorough patient evaluations.
Perfectly. Just as you are. -It's probably just stress. -Plenty of that going around. Or it could be our new passengers. The Orion females?
Remember that time we saw the Chicago Philharmonic perform? And it was the first time you told me that you loved me. Now I'm smothering your spirit. - The very thing I fell in love with. - I thought it was my exuberance.
You think that's bad? You should have seen the year I was Kunta Kinte's foot. It wasn't that I didn't like Halloween anymore, I just wanted to celebrate it like a teenager, which meant going to a party. You know, parties, they used to be like this:
Chris hit him in the jaw so hard, my tooth fell out. Chris knocked Caruso's eye out, put it back, and then knocked it out again. Chris beat the snot out of him. You can check his nose-- no snot! Chris chased him home, knocked out his family, then took their house.
Where do baby ants go to school? Go on. No, all these people going about pretending to be nuns. - What do you mean? - Do you think that's right? - It's a film.
Sweetie, your daddy and I are going to the movies tonight. How would you like LaDawn to baby-sit? Yes! I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley. That's what I love about high-school girls.
How would you like LaDawn to baby-sit? Yes! I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley. That's what I love about high-school girls. I keep getting older, they stay the same age.
Yes! I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley. That's what I love about high-school girls. I keep getting older, they stay the same age. Yes, they do.
I mean, what's the purpose... Shiny red ball. Peter, watch out! So what can I do for you, Peter? Well, Joe, I need to talk to you about something kind of personal.
This is turning out worse than Stewie's iPod commercial. Peter, you just need to show what a good father you are. Then you can get the kids back from Cleveland. Wait a second, Brian. You're right. And the best way to do that is to show what a terrible father Cleveland is.
You're hurting his feelings. Stop it! There's no jason. Listen to me, sybil. Giving up that baby was the best thing i could have done. When i got pregnant, i knew i had to walk away from that baby.
This is not a popularity contest. No, not a contest. You've already won. Emily, you are acting incredibly immature! You couldn't wait to run over to that inn of hers for your secret clandestine meeting!
Why do you hate it? I don't hate it. It's beautiful. It's just-- what if Jackson brought home a set of his grandmother's pots and pans? Now, obviously, you need some pots and pans, and these are free and all, but they're really old.
Riff. And a real man doesn't use a charcoal chimney. Oh, so now I'm not a real man? He is too. I have pictures to prove it. Do you have a spray bottle? For what?
I need to see you both immediately. Our SIGINT post in Manila just intercepted an encrypted telephone call between Arvin Sloane and a well-known underworld fixer. - Did we run a trace-back ? - The route masking was too high. Sloane requested the fluid be recovered from this bunker facility called Novgorod 21.
Timing's everything. Call it a hunch. We tried comming you, but we didn't get an answer. Dylan, it was an ambush. The magog aren't that cunning.
We tried comming you, but we didn't get an answer. Dylan, it was an ambush. The magog aren't that cunning. The lancers... they're dead. You saved them from something worse. Don't worry.
Magog. That's not the worldship. I mean, that's big, but the worldship is the size of a sun. It's some kind of satellite ship. Oh, fantastic.
Almost none. Now you all are being too comforting. What's really up? You're sick, and you're making it worse by worrying. We've got that sarcophagus under the scope.
And what's your favorite color? What's your favorite song? Who's the goalkeeper for Manchester United? How many fingers am I holding up? You wanna kill me? Try. I don't have time for your quirks. The power to draw back Illyria lies in there.
Not a good idea. Somebody wants to talk to me about something. Ah, she wants to talk to you. Got it. For some reason women feel safe around you. Maybe because you've only had sex four times. Four women!
That's okay. You've only been a Jew about two days. - Just try to talk to him. - Like you talked to me when I was growing up? - I thought you hated those lessons.
He puts insidious ideas in our minds. More lethal than any warhead. He creates fear. But you're right. He's a machine... and you don't keep a deadly machine around.
Am I? I see the truths that float past you in the stream. You have a real thing about rivers and streams, don't you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession. Do you realise I could kill you before they came back in the room?
You recall not doing it, finding the bodies dead. But as for your fingerprints on the murder weapon... why you gave the police false information after... delaying in calling the police, gee... - Just can't remember. - Objection. What a perfect way to tell your story without really being subject to cross-examination.
Well, my dear, this is why you should never pick up the couch left for curbside pickup. Polyurethane foam. Outlawed in 1988 due to its highly incendiary nature. You light that crap on fire, it heats up, creates a burning pool of liquid, and acts as its own accelerant. Disaster waiting to happen.
One peak per marker. Shared allels, so it was either a father or a son. According to the autopsy she never gave birth. - So it was her father. - Ok, so how did it get there?
Who shot your dog? Trace Tech. He analyzed the fuel from Aaron's pump. Confirmed it's diesel. The hydrocarbons found in the tree were from unleaded gasoline. Means the fuel on Aaron's farm was not used to cremate Rita's body.
No, this promotion isn't about money. Must be nice to be independently wealthy. We're done here, right? Yeah. Vacuum metal deposition.
It was negative. That was the one thing we insisted upon, not that it matters now. Who's the guy? Angela wouldn't say. The statue's an incubus.
Along with my $10 million. Yamamoto never checked out. Vanessa Green made reservations at the Princeville in Kauai. She never checked in. And he left without his antiques.
Did my uncle evacuate? He ran out of here, tried to get me to go with him, but I think they're all overreacting. The skies are blue. There's not a breeze in the air. This isn't a hurricane, ma'am.
Well, we've known about the fragility of the Cumbre Vieja volcano for years, but even the experts couldn't predict when the collapse would occur. I've actually done some computer animation to simulate the event. But the bank teller told us the bank robbers have been planning this for three months. How is that possible if they didn't know it was going to happen? It's not possible.
He was killed today in 660 Ruthland Ave. / So, we found your print on the window used as an escape. I was there looking for a friend. The door slammed behind me. Got locked in.
I'll go check on the labs. - Addison, don't do that. - Derek, look, she's a fighter. - Look how far she's come already. - Don't get attached, don't get involved.
- Dr. O'Malley. How are the leeches doing? They're not. I still can't get them to bite. With all this blood, you'd think it'd be a no-brainer for a leech.
Charlotte's lungs were a little more underdeveloped than the rest of the quints. So we put a special mask on her to help her breathe, and we're monitoring her closely. And that just leaves Kate. She seems to be pretty healthy. No major issues have been identified.
For your recipe... one tablespoon coconut extract. It's like one day you realize that the fairy tale may be slightly different than you dreamed. Where are we going? Trust me. The castle -- well, it may not be a castle.
He's a dilaudid junkie. So what do you do? Check the database for history, refer to a program, and discharge. After you give him something. That's exactly what he wants.
You okay? Yeah. - Allison's shoes are... - What? The rape victim, Allison, her shoes.
You're hot. You're drunk. Hold still. Wait, you're that -- that girl from the magazine. The red bikini.
It's the only way. Malachi has been telling me about the mark, apparently, only special ghosts get one. I wonder why mine went away. I just think I'm not special anymore. I think you're more special without it.
- Right. They're a bastard, I know. I do know. It feels like having your head in a vice. - You know what I mean?
I do. Believe me, I do. He offered you something, didn't he? Azazeal. Something to do with Cassie! And in return you gave him the stone, didn't you? Ella, no. You took the stone!
- She looks OK, though. I mean... she's through the worst of it? I'll be back as soon as I can. How can a secure psychiatric hospital manage to lose a section patient? It's a good question.
She has a three-centimeter mass... in her right upper lobe. Maybe it's a granuloma. No. There's no calcification. It's small-cell lung cancer. The tumor's starting to press against your esophagus.
It's genetic. Caused the gland to wither to nothing. This is why she couldn't gain weight. Yeah. I'll call the police and Social Services and have all the charges withdrawn. I've sent a test down to confirm.
Increase the steroids to 100 milligrams every 12 hours and, uh-- start him on I.V.I.G. What is Mr. Giles's status? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. One gram per kilo.
Any new babes you might wanna tell me about? Leave him alone, John. Got a new motorcycle. Might have seen it out front, it's orange with a gigantic scrape. Is it the one in the handicapped parking? Yeah.
Pretty, pretty please. Lisa, are you sure you're okay with this? I should be the one to tell the family. Your hand is dying. The bacteria are eating it.
- Ativan. It'll help settle you down. - Why are you so calm? Not coming off meth helps. Last night probably shouldn't happen again. Do you think I want it to?
Face it. This might be an interesting case. What if his immune system is too strong? An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible. His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep. It wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight.
I never did! You too, Sequoia. Well no, that's not true, I... I know that everybody lies, but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn't be trying so hard. Your rings don't match.
It needs to be removed surgically. With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival. But I have to warn you-- depending on how large the tumor is and how ingrained it is, the surgeon may need to amputate your leg. I'm sorry. It's okay.
- Amputation is safer. - For you or me? - The blockage of blood flow-- - Four-day blockage. Yes.
Sealing it up tight, probably drooling and planning. But by the time you were finished, you were too big to bait, and there was nobody left here to hose you down. You got stuck in your own trap, Ronald. Like some huge bloated spider. Shut up, bitch!
Lewis. Lewis ? They're close. Yeah. Based on the first victim's blood test, the C.D.C. thinks it may be a strain of asian flu that hasn't been seen since 1957.
Well, when am I supposed to worry about it, Russell? When the military firebombs our house? Those guys were up my butt ! Okay, look, I gotta go. "Up your butt?"
When the military firebombs our house? Those guys were up my butt ! Okay, look, I gotta go. "Up your butt?" What if these creatures put holes in our bodies so they can, like, feed us information?
Nice. Ahem. Attitude and a little tailoring, maybe. I may need a little time. And time. Time will help.
I may need a little time. And time. Time will help. The laws of physics are immutable, are they not, noble warriors? The answer...
Don't go, okay? Look, it's fine. No, it's not fine. I don't do this. I don't wake up in some guy's bed and put my clothes on from the night before and sneak home.
Who likes the transitive property? That's weird. It works for me. Hey, Maria, you like the transitive property? Take me to the car, you sexy bastard. Wow, so this chair is new?
Not in a play that I'm directing. Well, then I guess you're not directing. Then I guess I'm leaving. Well, then I guess I'm not giving you a ride home. Then I hope the 147 bus goes down Wilshire.
You're starting to sound like the people I pulled from that burning car. Our research shows us that in your role as a single father, you're becoming very popular with women over 30. How do you feel about that? Great. You know, I feel like women really come into their own after the age of 30.
You guys are a beautiful couple. Now this may be the alcohol talking, but... It's the alcohol. Don't say it. Don't take this for granted. You have to put your love in a bottle and make a promise to drink from it every day.
To be honest, I haven't gotten around to the arts projects. You haven't read it? I've been focusing on the social justice programs. Look at this, Bette. There's a group, in Boston, wants to convert an old residential hotel into a shelter for homeless women and children.
Helena, civilizations wither and die without the arts. Very dramatic. I'm not ruling out the arts, Bette. I'm just saying the foundation is looking at different priorities. Well, once you read our proposal, you'll see one of the projects, "Our Clothes, Our City", is by seven young women, asylum-seekers from Rwanda, Kenya and Kosovo.
- I'm aware of that. - That's why I'm here. Obviously. - Obviously. Well, I'm sure you've received our proposal.
You did ? That's fantastic! Bette, I know you're anxious to hear from us. Rest assured I will read your proposal and give it a fast and fair hearing. Now, who wants to stop at the Enchanted Forest on the way home, hey?
That money and a little bit more. You mean the money that you were paid for parking stocks? The money you gambled to get our attention? I'm sorry, man. I never had a really tight whip.
And when I get back from the ladies room, I expect there to be a car out front. A lot of moxie in that girl. Yeah, Abby, she bought these rings. Irish Claddagh rings. See the two hands holding the heart?
Yeah, Abby, she bought these rings. Irish Claddagh rings. See the two hands holding the heart? Romantic. Whatever, they were, like, $30 for the pair. Jimmy, keep an eye on my chips.
I told her no. But she kept asking me and asking me. I didn't want her to be mad. So I said yes. Their mothers are full of crap.
When kids don't get the attention and affection they need, they look for it elsewhere. You think Lisa was one of those kids? I don't think so. The only time I ever had to call her in was over the sex bracelets, and I'm sure that was just peer pressure. Sex bracelets?
Cragen wants us back at the house. Take care. Logan would like us to file charges. Against whom? Dr. Blair.
I'm fine. Your trebuchet - why didn't it work? It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough. I don't think that glass is gonna break, man. Everything breaks if you apply the right force.
What? ! We've come up here to make a difference in the world! Yeah! To speak for women like this one who can't speak for themselves!
We've come up here to make a difference in the world! Yeah! To speak for women like this one who can't speak for themselves! Yeah, because they're billboards! Shut up.
We love you, boys! Right on, sister! Check out that pig. You don't have to talk about them like that. They've been really nice to us.
Check out that pig. You don't have to talk about them like that. They've been really nice to us. Yeah, and they really believe in this stuff. That is such a load.
Do you have a giant dollar? I'll get a whole bunch if you'll come back again. I'll come back every night if you want. You're so great. The girls at school won't even talk to me.
- We're not going to be able to win this... - Dewey, don't look into her eyes! Huh? What just happened? Damn it.
It's supposed to be hard to make. I can't believe you would humiliate me in front of my friends! Friends? Those women are monsters. They treat me like garbage.
There we go. If Mommy asks, you got a bath. -Did you get it? -Oh, yeah. Exhumed Maniac.
Your children and your children's children will grow up grounded in this house! I can't hear what he's saying. But judging by the color of his face, I probably shouldn't ask for the car this weekend. Dad, come on. I've got something to show you.
- Uh, yeah, it'll hold. Okay. - Bye, guys. - Bye, Mom. "When little Autumn Mowry"was 13, she broke her neck diving into a pool.
Oh, my God, I am so glad to see you. Why, you tired of making small talk with the bleeding hearts? Well, actually, these people are presenting a very compelling argument. The case against Butler isn't terribly strong. I hate to see him get out of jail because of it.
Did you hear the first part? I was riveted, and it's the fifth time I've heard it. Now hang on one sec, and I'm coming over to hear the thrilling conclusion. You're kidding, right? Well, it's the law of probabilities.
[ Man ] Keep up the good work. Here you go, fella. I always like to help the homeless. Don't spend it on booze! - Dad. - Move along, hobo.
- Randy, life isn't about always having fun. Maybe it's time for you to grow up and realize that. Now go wait in the car. I'm sorry about that. Don't worry, I'll find your dog, but that's it, right?
Oh, so you weren't sleeping with her? You're under arrest, Sergeant. For what? We'll start with adultery and work our way up from there. I don't mean to be rude, but couldn't you have just sent me my husband's personal effects, Agent Todd? Well, normally we would have, but that camera you bought him is pretty expensive.
Why do you think they give you those little key tags they scan when you check out? For discounts. It's to collect information they sell to telemarketers. What brands you buy, how much, how often... Isn't that against the law?
Where? Here. It's a mirror. Quick question. The pink ones.
Oh, there must be 30 pages there. More. What's carved into their backs? It's his calling card, McGee. Something wrong?
Well, shooting at human cutout is not quite the same, Timothy. No one is prepared for their first kill. Abby, I'm gonna need you to run his prints. Driver's license was phony. The only Andrew Aidan Ryan I could find is three years old and lives in Los Angeles.
The person I saw arguing with Benedict was a passenger. There was a third man. That's a great movie. Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles... We're looking in the wrong direction.
Someone else gotr bottle of Jack and you got their... Doesn't the post office irradiate our mail? Yeah, that's right! All Federal mail is funneled through the Ion Beam facility at Bridgeport, New Jersey. If it has DNA, it dies.
What? These blue lights. Are you serious? Ever heard of a placebo, Kate? Tony... placebos are administered for a psychological effect.
These blue lights. Are you serious? Ever heard of a placebo, Kate? Tony... placebos are administered for a psychological effect. How do you know these lamps aren't there to make us think they're helping, hmm?
You apply it with a feather. You don't use the whole chicken? I never heard oney dust. Yeah, that's because your mother raised you to respect women, McGee. It makes a woman's skin feel silky sh.
Well, Tony said he didn't see anything, but the eye sees more than we think it does. It's the brain that misses stuff it has to do with the firing of the optic nerve and the visual cortex... You found something from Tony's camera. Well, I went to the feed, frame by frame. Now, Tony is looking at the pay phone, because that's where he thinks the target is.
Of course. Just checking to make sure everything's in order. Would you like me to have the maid make up the bed for you, sir? Oh, that won't be necessary. Oh, and can you check the minibar?
It appears to be gold, surgically embedded in the conjunctival layer. Perhaps some type of body jewelry? Jewelry embedded in an eye? Oh, yes, you'd be amazed what people do to themselves. To Abby, please.
If it's still available, we need to take the job at the mortuary. The hotel De La Mer was Miami's most exclusive spot in the twenties. Is that urine? I wouldn't touch anything. What happened to this place?
The hotel De La Mer was Miami's most exclusive spot in the twenties. Is that urine? I wouldn't touch anything. What happened to this place? Well, it only has 16 rooms.
Take Austin and go wait in the car. What is going on? Did somebody follow us? No, no. I--I'm just not feeling well all of a sudden.
This is the woman he remembers, the woman he loves. He took that photo on our 20th wedding anniversary. Do you think you could make me look like this again? Maybe it would jog his memory. Here's my problem.
Open? "Open," if there's no need to hide the murder. "Secret," if it has to appear as an accident. You're sure about this? I mean, Korfelt hasn't even started talking yet. I've worked with the national security agency on intercepts of actual covert communications.
Not necessarily. You can create a Bayesian filter. I could, if I had any idea what that meant. Do you ever get any junk e-mail or spam? Well,that's why they create spam filters-- to filter out junk e-mail from regular e-mail.
What's a Millennium Problem? Seven, like, classic, difficult math problems. The Clay Institute of Mathemati offers one million dollars for the solutions to each of them. All right, well, that's motive. So, how would he collect the award?
Y said, if we cooperated... you said we'd get our daughter back. Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. I think there's a way. Reimann's is a master key- it opens all doors. Well, they have a plan to open just one door- it's a really important door.
I mean, they hooked their hoses to the standpipe, okay? What is that, the standpipe? The building's water supply pipe. It's firefighter use only. And it was functioning properly?
We need to notify Security in the building to keep everyone inside. - Roger that. - Excuse me. We need you to get inside the building, please. Agent Eppes,Lieutenant Douglas. Your teams are where? Blue Team and Red Team are about eight minutes out, sir.
Come on, it's not against the law for a bunch of lab techs to exchange information. You gotta admit, this is pretty major information. Why is that you don't seem too concerned? Are you kidding? I know this bug better than you,
I haven't done anything wrong, and I'd like you to leave. You sure about that? I can't stress how serious a matter this is, sir. Believe me, it's my big shot. My whole career is riding on this outbreak.
- All right. And if I am, in fact, meeting with George Lucas... - I have my Boba Fett T-shirt. - Dude, it's a little small. I got it when I was eight.
It's for my kid. She's, uh... she's had, uh, uh, some bad luck. Well, runs in the family, I guess. Look, the best way for you to get your money is to give me more. So why don't you sell the boat?
No, you didn't. I took a shower the day before yesterday. I'm making you a bagel. No. You need to eat.
She's always jealous of me hanging around Brooke. - And you know she has a crush on you. - That's not true. Why did we leave our last school, Anna? Because once the rumors started, we couldn't stop them.
What if he's just blinded by a pretty face and a hot body? Some would say the same about you. You can't let Erica get away with smearing you like that. You leave this unanswered, it becomes the truth. So, what do you think I should do about Erica's ads?
Goes in everybody's record, no matter how it's disposed of. No, sir. Good. Anything else? What do we do about the women?
- Yeah? Yeah. Well, they're improvised by people who don't really know what they're doing. I mean, half of them- old ladies, kids- just blows up in their faces all the time or just goes off whenever. We put a lot of rounds in that car. Yeah, it wouldn't make a difference if it's C-4.
Yeah. Well, they're improvised by people who don't really know what they're doing. I mean, half of them- old ladies, kids- just blows up in their faces all the time or just goes off whenever. We put a lot of rounds in that car. Yeah, it wouldn't make a difference if it's C-4. I mean, you can hit C-4 with a hammer, and it won't go off.
God. Veered off the material a little bit there in the end, don't you think? God, I don't know what is wrong with me today. I just - I spent the entire tour telling all these horrible stories.
- Just a sleepy little town. No. That place is her training ground. She's the child of darkness... and she's under his protection now. When people get close to me, if I get angry or upset- - Something bad happens to them.
Your son is the prime suspect in a double homicide. Hey. What do you think this is, siesta? See that? See my face up there?
That. You know, I never put too much stock in those mixers at Woody's. You know, I never put too much stock in those mixers at Woody's. I mainly went to confirm my conviction I mainly went to confirm my conviction that nothing would ever come of it. that nothing would ever come of it. That is so pessimistic. That is so pessimistic. It's not pessimistic, it's, uh... it's Jewish. It's not pessimistic, it's, uh...
Would you really have the 13th fasten their crest without you? You come back to the legion, you shall be inducted into the Evocati as a prefect. Of the first grade, with a signing bonus. Say, uh... 10,000 sesterce. I chose this path.
He does have a vulgarian streak. I don't mind it. What is this about the eagle? My personal standard was stolen by brigands. A bad business.
Tuesdays and thursdays... I scooter to my baby! Honey... I haven't fuffied in bed in, like, a week. With 27 deaths so far, this strain of E. Coli from tainted meat is quite serious. So if you're a big meat-eater, be careful.
- Yes! Turk was freaked out because Carla never joins us on Sanford and son night... or Cheers night. I think it was because she was feeling a little romantically competitive with Kylie and me. Woman, woman! I am not a lollipop!
What's gonna happen to you now? What do you mean? I feel like I started something with you, but I didn't get to finish it. We got Antwon Mitchell. You ever think about how it's all gonna end up for you?
Nine months and a delivery and you don't even want the kid. I mean, who would do that? - Christians. - No, not only. Some women just can't deal with making a decision, And they leave it too long.
And God knows, she looks terrific. - Aunt mary did? - I'm telling you, More women have miscarried Than they have masturbated with a dildo. They just don't talk about it.
- Excuse me! Did you see that? - What? I think that might be the dark blue nissan they're looking for. The guy who's murdering children.
Yeah. Listen, I can't really talk right now. I just stepped out of a meeting, but I... wanted to call 'cause I didn't get a chance to before I left. Is Lex with you? No, I'm solo. Well, you'd better stay that way.
Sir, we don't have a choice. Carter, what about the ZPM? If we wait, we lose any chance of getting it back to our time. Preserving the timeline is more important. For all you know, things could get better!
Jack, think about it. With a fully functional ZPM, we could power Earth's defences and open up a wormhole to the Pegasus Galaxy. Now remember Jack, 3,000 BC. When Sam diverts power to the time device, think about that date and nothing else This thing's Ancient.
So you're here to offer me the opportunity to ascend again. - If that is what you wish. - What I wish? What are my options? Personally, I would choose eternal enlightenment rather than the alternative. If it were only that simple.
Bring her. - What is the meaning of this? - I should ask you the same thing. Major Samantha Carter. Actually, I'm a colonel now.
You are truly blessed. Oh, I don't know about that. Just doing the best that I can. - How many have fallen ill? - I've lost count, but it's a lot.
You have my promise. Good. I would hate to see anything happen to you. I do so enjoy our dinners together. The Dart went back through the Gate.
It won't be able to dial, so it won't be a problem. Now, the ZedPM, however, will be. Now, as you know, the zero point module controls the flow of massive amounts of power. Like a dam. No. It's not like a dam, it's more like a... actually, yes, it's like a dam.
They don't think they need us, till they need us! Then they need us. Take a look at this. Six naqahdah-enhanced nuclear warheads. They emit almost zero EM and are invisible to radar.
You have observed the inequalities of our society, and you disapprove. I can hardly blame you. You didn't seem to have much of a problem with that in the village. I must maintain the image of my authority in front of the villagers. It is my duty, but believe me, between the two of us, you are in a better position to change things.
- lt's not my fault she had alcohol. How could you be so nice to her after you know what she's done? I thought you wanted revenge. Yeah. I had to win her round.
Get in the house! Sorry. I told him the truth. We had a plan, Matt. What happened to the plan?
What we have to do? It's two parts. The first part is spells the demon from the victim's body and makes it manifest which actually makes him more powerful. - More powerful? - Yeah. How?
Nimrod! Nimrod!" No. Negative. Not happening. And chicks, man. Chicks dig anything with big, round eyes.
Well, what makes you so special that you get to talk to your dead brother and no one else gets to? You know, I miss my grandmother, but I don't get to talk to her none. I don't expect you to understand. Well, now, that you got right, boy. 'Cause you got a family and they love you.
- You're so attached. - oh... look, don't worry. All she does is sleep. It's like taking care of a bowling ball. I don't like bowling, man.
You don't have to wrap it. It'll totally make him wish he was dead. Yeah. Well, it's between that or one of those shirts that makes him look all muscley. Look at the blanket I got for our new apartment. I found it in a dumpster.
Exactly. I don't remember that at all, man. Okay, Michael, Eric, pull your pants down and lean over the table. I'll go get those gigantic needles.
I want double reinforcements on every building. It's done,except Wi-Fi jammers. We're trying to cut the phone cable line, but it's buried 20 feet underground. It'll take a few hours. We can't wait.
- Caffrey's protocols? - Yeah. You really ought to start reading them. How'd it go? One of the detectives is none too happy we're taking over his crime scene, but,uh,he offered full cooperation. What are you doing?
All right,let's have our data miners turn miami upside down. Uh,focus on electronics--tv,radio,internet. Look for anything out of the ordinary that's happened in the last 24 hours. I've taken apart at least a dozen cell phones and pdas from the party last night. The alien signal's been imprinted on every component
- Are we too late? Well,so far,none of these phones have dialed out since the party last night. - What's it waiting for? - Could be on a learning curve. The signal's adapting to our technology.
"Genetically Modified Organisms." Yeah, I've been to the supermarket. It looks like Sonntag injected these plants with the enzyme. Designer DNA. It's the basis for most GMO research.
What happened a week ago? We had to up the dosage. He was having nightmares, waking up, screaming, that kind of thing. He had delusions that there are aliens among us-- not atypical for these kinds of illnesses. You see, extraterrestrials often represent our darker selves.
M-M-My dad and I were digging a well, and, um... there was a piece of metal down there-- an object... Wh-What kind of object? Describe it to me. It was copper-colored. It was about the size of a football.
Only after they brought it in the house. What about that chick in the condo? Her DNA's clean as a whistle. She obviously wasn't in proximity to the object long enough for it to do any damage. It must've been buried under enough dirt to dampen the effects.
It's probably just the eggnog. Well, we'll talk later, okay? When are you gonna tell her that I know the secret? We have the best dad in the freaking world. He got me an apartment.
More push. Less smush, got it. Hello, everybody. Would you mind leaving? Wow.
Alan, let me give you some advice. Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions. We don't want you to lose that ability. We want her to. Of course. Very good. What else?
All right. Just, you know, make it quick. My ass needs some major work here, okay? Well, the headphones aren't broken. I love this song.
It's in the flap. The flap, right. What flap? The packet I gave you. I put it in there.
The gun belonged to Anissa. This should be good. We know she has a firearms rap. Parole in those cases forbids you to own a gun. The boys attack her, she pulls the gun, they flee.
I can't wait until Diane and her friends see me driving. With any luck, I'll be driving up a virgin and driving home a well-oiled sex machine. Or a virgin who stole his mom's car and got thrown in jail and then became a well-oiled sex machine. I can't believe we got all the way to Diane's house, and you forgot to take off your mom's blouse Well, at least the girls know who I am now.
This is about me. This is how I feel about myself. And I feel inferior. Oh, come on. Come on, give me a break.
I'll go to the desk and straighten everything out. Go back to class. I gotta pee. Fine, hurry up. Hold up the bell.
I don't care if they were born that way so long as they are now Well, that's great So it is my writing that you like? Oh, I love it, but I may be the only one I heard from my contacts at The New Yorker They didn't really care for it Well, what'd they say exactly?
That was for me Mrs. Newsom, good news My schedule has freed up so I can do that job for you Yes- - Yeah, it would have been nice to work on that hotel. But I am-- I'm equally passionate about, um... converting your terrace into an eco-friendly ferret village I brought you some hot chocolate 'cause I remember that was your favorite
Well, if there's a compliment higher than that, I don't know what it is You know what else, my sweet, sweet Rosie? What, Mommy? Now that I have these glasses on... I can see the layer of filth that's covering every surface in this bathroom,including you! So get your two friends, chamois and 409, and get to work!
He's taking the piss. He took photographs before he covered up the slogan. Sexually-motivated killers often revisit the scene. To relive the moment. And having a photo's the next best thing. Roisin Johnson might not have been pregnant.
We have to go on. We don't have any choices. You won't take time off. Within an hour, you'll be back at work, pushing a rock up a hill. Tony, I understand that this is really difficult for you, but, please... help me. He's not making conscious decisions, Carol.
He didn't. I changed cabs. If he found you there, he could find us here. We need to pack up and go. Adisa, what is all this? General Gamba, he's in town.
No. I didn't wanna give her idiot friend any reason to come back to my house. What idiot friend? The one she brought to knock me around. What did you do, steal the DVD out of my mail? It doesn't matter how I ended up with it.
Just like the time when you took a month to tell me how Stella got her groove back. I was touched. First, she didn't have her groove, and then she did. Okay, fine. Maybe I feel a little guilty about how lucky I am.
This is a mustard we're developing. Grows just about anywhere and we're hoping we can seed it using crop plants. And what's so special about it? Well, there are a hundred million unexploded land mines in the world that are killing and maiming an average of- 26,000 people every year, yeah. - Yeah. That's right.
- Oh, Alejandro Malavilla. - Holà Alejandro, mucho gusto. Jill Langston. I'm just going to check and make sure his stuff's not all broken. Beavers have no exterior sexual organs, but they do have castor oil glands, which is where many perfumes get their scent.
We can not deny it. Thank you, baby. You have not loved, is not it? No, no, no, it's great. I can turn the page now.
I failed. Where are you taking me? We're taking you to face justice. Right. But where, specifically? A place you're quite familiar with, actually.
Because in my opinion, maybe 1 977 was the time rock music in London was the best. And that era is an era in my dream. So maybe one night I dreamt of that scene. And then I wrote this song to express my yearning for London. More and more young women don't think of nothing but earning money, so that they can buy expensive clothes.
It's a master of stealth. This cricket has huge eyes but it's difficult to see what's going on around it. Though the velvet worm has fangs, it will attack its prey when it finds it with a very special weapon. Anxiously, the cricket probes around in the darkness with its long antennae. The velvet worm will only know if it's found its prey when it touches it.
Like slugs, they're hermaphrodite, each individual both male and female. They mate by lying alongside one another. Two narrow grooves form between their two bodies. These are the conduits that carry sperm from one partner to the other. Their bodies slowly pulse as sperm travels along the space between them.
"What is the #%@@?" "What was I thinking?" So, you take it to a charity shop. That generally is the extent of our charity. We give away all the #%@@ we never needed or wanted in the first place. And that's why charity shops themselves have that incredible funk of depression. That layered smell and all the women who work in there are a hundred and three.
Sophie is from Marseilles, which means that she wears three or four outer garments even in July. Our English weather feeds her overactive French imagination. Oh, you disappoint me. Maybe we could tell each other ghostly stories. I'm in need of a little danger.
Certainly not a Christian man. Although I'm sure that Mr Eshton has all sorts of new ideas about that. For once, I must admit ignorance. The brain is a vast and wonderful landscape. We have not even begun to navigate its mysteries.
Oh, now, there it is! There is my book, The Beast Within, sitting there all the time. No, but I'm sure I looked there this morning. Maybe the ghost took it. The ghost? The ghost.
There is my book, The Beast Within, sitting there all the time. No, but I'm sure I looked there this morning. Maybe the ghost took it. The ghost? The ghost. Sophie says it walks the corridors at night.
Corner of Smithfield and Liberty. 4:30 PM, Thursday. Thank you. Just keep the change. Did you see that blue car go by?
Pivotal object. Very powerful. What's this? Oh, the prime object. The one that connects everything. They say that the prime object controls all of the other objects.
I try to do better, and... somehow I just don't do better. Tonight's a big night. I'm introducing the senator. Tim's very excited about that. That I'm introducing the senator. -I can't decide.
That I'm introducing the senator. -I can't decide. Those shoes are beautiful, sir, and they fit her well. Fine. I'll take those. Do you want to put 'em on first, walk around a little bit?
-I can't decide. Those shoes are beautiful, sir, and they fit her well. Fine. I'll take those. Do you want to put 'em on first, walk around a little bit? You don't need to know how they feel?
Those shoes are beautiful, sir, and they fit her well. Fine. I'll take those. Do you want to put 'em on first, walk around a little bit? You don't need to know how they feel? It's not about how they feel, Jack, it's about how they look.
I will see to it that you have the proper credentials. You have your five minutes, Miss Janacek. Thank you, Mr. Buckley! Please slow down. I can barely walk in these silly shoes.
Collaborate with him. And it's Christmas. In 18 hours, the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered to its Middle Eastern buyer, and we'll have credible intel to prove it. US Security Council will get a report by this time tomorrow. We're talking a military strike within a week.
I understand that you're the mother but you also have to think of his interest. Yeah, it's possible. But he is already damaged. I can't take any chances. Let me see your hand.
Parallel synchronized randomness. An interesting brain rarity and our subject for today. Two people walk in opposite directions at the same time and then they make the same decision at the same time. Then they correct it, and then they correct it and then they correct it and then they correct it.... Basically, in a mathematical world these two little guys will stay looped for the end of time.
He's an animal. He doesn't feel his body. I did everything wrong. I screwed up. I'll take the bus her e.
This dog proves Beck is innocent. He was on a computer at Medianet between 10:36 and 11:13, according to their records. He was told to leave the dog outside. 2 witnesses have positively identified him. Assuming the alibi checks out...
He was on a computer at Medianet between 10:36 and 11:13, according to their records. He was told to leave the dog outside. 2 witnesses have positively identified him. Assuming the alibi checks out... Don't worry, it will.
Few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was. Now, my dear, the word in French for Holy Grail. From the Middle English "Sangreal" of the original Arthurian legend. Now, as two words. Can you translate for our friend? Sang real, it means "royal blood."
You're an author, not a thief. The streets are full of them, blondes and brunettes. One in a red fox fur just getting out of a fancy foreign car. Girls in the plaza. They're everywhere, and none of them mine.
What was that? Nothing. Time's up, peewees. - It's Halloween. We got things to do. - We do? No, wait, you can't.
Your head's rolling. You can't see it, your eyes are on your head. - Sir? I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen. Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.
The resemblance to Henry is unmistakable. The nose. For 23 years, I toiled side-by-side with your father. Even now, he works from there and I from here. That's when I first planted the vines.
- I find that strange. - Yeah, that's what I said to Beth. It's Oedipal. What's the rush? Although I will say, when I was trying to potty-train Christian,
- We'll head away from the sun. - No, towards the sun. To the north. Starboard... Leftboard. Just follow my finger.
- That's outstanding. - Yeah. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. Lets people know you're not a homo. Married guy seems more stable. People see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the s. o. b.
It's real, man, smoke him out! Yeah. How do we do that Mr. Fucking Genius who didn't even graduate from The Academy. Listen, all right? Let it slip to S.I.U. that you have a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell S.I.U.
Good night, Wilbur. Fern had walked across the road to her uncle's barn hundreds of times before, but it had never felt so far away. It was just a big red barn full of typical stuff. Come to think of it, it couldn't have been more ordinary.
It's what they do to prisoners... at least the lucky ones. If I were you, cowpokes... I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna. Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason. Think of your girls back home, waiting for you. But a girl cannot stay home every night.
Politicians and actors. You put them in a restaurant together... they'd die of old age before picking up the check. Then New York City, Times Square... dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago... Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"? That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
He cant be seen. immediately after MiIIie's wedding he went to Europe. Looks like he settled there. Every scene.. every moment! This crazy heart is lonely.
Because I worry needlessly. What if those two guineas have conspired to fuck us on Monday? We can't risk it. Do you understand? Sean, we've checked everything. What about his jail cell?
- Yeah, I know what apnea- It's like a sleeping sickness. It's like I slept through the whole fuckin' trial. I wake up, the judge is sentencing me to 30 years. The hammer comes down.
Noir's the name. Guy Noir. But I'd taken temporary employment about six years before... doing security for a radio show called A Prairie Home Companion... on account of a serious cash-flow problem... due to a lack of missing heiresses and dead tycoons lying in the solarium... with lipstick stains on their smoking jackets. In other words, I was broke. This radio show was done out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald... and it had been on the air since Jesus was in the third grade.
Professor Hilbert, I've totally failed at the comedy-tragedy thing. In fact, I think she likes me even less. - I know, it's great. - What do you mean? You've proved something else entirely. The voice seems to be dependent on actions you take.
In fact, I think she likes me even less. - I know, it's great. - What do you mean? You've proved something else entirely. The voice seems to be dependent on actions you take. You reset your watch, it says you reset your watch.
- I know, it's great. - What do you mean? You've proved something else entirely. The voice seems to be dependent on actions you take. You reset your watch, it says you reset your watch. You ride a bus, it says you ride the bus.
What? Are you serious? I don't fuck around when it comes to ass to mouth. You never go ass to mouth. It's never my idea.
They're in the garden... Because you wrecked the fence. The car... Well... What? You came from up there and drove into the fence.
Karl, come over here! One moment... Emma, you have to be in it too. Mother, come here! The  <hon>car<hoff> smells of petrol
I would like to rent one for a longer period. I don't know. Three months or so What charges? No, you don't have to change the return ? ight.
What? The ? ywheel was out of balance. I repaired it. You wouldn't think it, but I know a lot about engines I get it nicely unbalanced and you ruin it! What?
A tall fat one and a small fat one. The tall fat one wanted to cut across the bull 's pasture. But the small fat one was afraid. The tall fat one said, "The bull won't do you any harm." So they walked across the pasture. The bull watched them closely.
Rudell. If a jury finds out we're a couple, then we both have a motive. And that changes everything. Don't worry about him, baby. He's just jealous.
Kenneth Giles. Can I shoot you? Kenneth, why would you want to do something like that? So the bullet bounces off. Can I?
- Leonore. - You come around here, dragging around like a wet goddamn dog! Leonore, stop it! Art, we talked about this. This picture's important.
What if they don't want sympathy? What else could they want? It's a publicity stunt, isn't it? For Christ sakes. Our photos are plastered all over every paper in Europe right now.
See you then. Do you know her? -Oh yeah. I was in a flat... share with her 20 years ago, but not for long. I could never stand feminists. That bitch and her friend were obsessed with rotating the kitchen chores.
Beautiful creatures. I'd never make the grade. At the end of my vacation I crept into Jane's room. I jerked off on my mother. And this fucking cat was watching me the whole time.
Well, Andy, I'm just about ready to flip my lid. Henry Winthorpe III just left The Factory. Oh, the toothpaste heir? How were his teeth? Oh, I didn't notice, but his cock was beautiful.
La Salle. Okay, so that's how you know it. Hell, we probably drank there when we were in high school. It's not far from home, Jo. I haven't been to La Salle since I was little.
I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service. Your whole life. That is a commitment to God as well as your people. What if my actions are damaging the Crown? Damaging it?
Diego, there are whole continents moving faster than you. We gotta catch up with the others. Knock it off. Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger. Have some fun. The ice is thin enough without you two wearing it down.
- Run for your lives! - Where's everybody going? - The world's coming to an end. - What are you talking about? Fast Tony - he says the world's gonna flood.
- Well, I do. All my life I've been oppressed, Augusten. And all my life I've worked hard to fight that oppression. When I was a little girl living in Cairo, Georgia, I had a black nanny named Elsa who lived in a shack on the other side of town. And in those days black people were called niggers.
It was maybe ten seconds, I think. Anyway, really fast. What are you talking about? She beat up Parrotfish with just one swing. He must be drunk out of his mind. No, trust me this time.
Never again will the winds be this shameless. Never again will our steps falter so blameless. Never again will the winds be this shameless. Never again will our steps falter so blameless. This rain is not so straight, it has a twist.
Grant? Are you okay? You okay? Meat Morning baby
Reach out and tell me your dreams. Your future Mrs... W-R-l-T-E. Can have the pick of the litter, Buster. Casanova Cop and his naughty nightstick seek receptacle for love.
That's all. That's all. We hauled 'em back to New York. The trial lasted forty-four days. They were charged with three murders and tied to twenty more.
The archaeological yard of Theresa Russel in Jerusalem. It is great. Cathy, the Old City is small. Some battlements separate it of the New City. Theresa wants to prove...
- The British. Remain where you are. That God protects the king... A revolver. To whom is this weapon?
How are the women? The fucking ho's, baby! The fucking girls! - yöu fuck the shit out of them! - Yes! Then yöu never call them again. Why yöu don't call them?
Certainly. May I? Where does power flow from? Skill or destiny, or divine right? We all know the story of a sword called Excalibur.
And maybe I snore a little, I don't know... Oh, that's okay, 'cause I know I snore. It's a nice place you've got here. I'm gonna have me a spot like this someday... someplace clean. You can get whatever you want, Rock.
Sergei? This is Laura. - My son's been kidnapped. - What? I don't have much time.
But as our daughter, Linda, was unable to look after her, my wife, Ellen, and I raised Vivienne as our own for 1 6 years. Vivienne was a real one-off, and the most gentle and generous person I have ever met. She had an amazing ability, accepting people for what they are, embracing their differences. Most of you are probably aware that Vivienne wanted to be a writer. On her last visit to us, only a week or so ago, she gave me a children's picture book that she was working on.
I don't want to impose on Mr Chong's time, but I need to speak to him. Mr Chong listens, no secrets for anyone. The facility you just bought has a structural weakness. Defect, flaw... translate defect. Where defect?
Thank you, I'll do that. Do you need anything else? Good afternoon, Mr. Gross. - Hello. I inspected the machine again this morning.
Which one of you is the rider? I am. My name is Eragon. I am Ajihad, leader of the Varden. If you are the rider, call your beast inside.
There used to be a risk, but nowadays it's a harmless operation. There. All done. Pass me the bowl! The placenta didn't even get damaged. I did not think it would be grown that far.
I've heard that she doesn't exist, that she's buried in that graveyard even that she's.... She burnt to death. The liars! They can't accept her, or won't. They seem to blame her for all--
She burnt to death. The liars! They can't accept her, or won't. They seem to blame her for all-- Edward, I think they're gonna hurt her, or even--
- Babies, what's wrong? - Nothing. You wrote a screenplay. And they made a movie out of it! I know and I should be grateful. Look, I'm very lucky. It's just...
' followed by the sheepish admission of truth. This heralds a period of deeper intimacy. A period I like to call the 'fart honeymoon'. Where both parties find each other's gas just the cutest thing in the world. But of course no honeymoon can last forever. And so we reach the critical fork in the fart.
[Chuckles] I mean, I run my fingers over my face... but that tells me shit about how I look. - And that matters to you, does it? - Sure. Yeah. Of course it does.
- Even when we were in school and you had to help me? Ahh. Wait a second. It's those girls you been dating. - I just don't get it, man. - Look, Danny boy. Girls are something you cannot figure out, all right?
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods, tell her no for the 40th time. No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. Then call my ex-husband and remind him the parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight. Then call my husband, ask him to meet me for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.
Have you ever lacked anything? Have you? Well, let's take it easy, okay? Let's go. I don't know why you want that sign.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Jenkins. - Second time this week. - I know, Mr. Jenkins. I'm sorry, it won't happen again. My first year at art college was boring to say the least.
Why aren't the floors protected? It was draughty. The floor protection's on the windows. Floor protection on the windows and wall paint on the floor. Where are the windows? With the doors, in the garden.
Where are the windows? With the doors, in the garden. Why aren't they installed? They are, in the garden. Why the garden? !
Sorry. I meant the Cold Duck. I've bought you expensive gifts. Like what? Your car. 78,000 francs.
I do like the sea. The sea? You don't find it boring? No. I like the feeling that the sea isn't judging me.
Thank you, gentlemen. Smile. That's a good one. I don't know how anyone can look at numbers all day. Well, if you look at them as just numbers, I guess it can get pretty dry.
Where you going? Why didn't you go, Steve? Get out of the car. Now. It doesn't run. They parted it years ago.
Holy liability he's alive! Eh-eh, get back to work everybody, he's fine! Carl Junior, are you all right? Would you look at the size of my 'Wood-Pecker! ' Don't worry buddy, we're going to get you to a hospital and fix you up real good.
No, you come here. My dad is a shaheed (martyr) too. Sometimes I dream that same voice I don't see the face, but I can hear the voice saying "You have five minutes to leave the house!"
God will guide you there. Hurry up now. Let's get going. Salvatore, you see these two girls? I'm entrusting them to you.
Come on, come on, come on ! Go, go go ! Charlie, drop the damn rocks ! Let's go ! I just got off an 18-hour flight from Indonesia.
You didn't have a sale for six fucking months. What are you talking about? You almost shit your pants in front of the president of Gyro Tech. I thought you were gonna cry like a little fucking girl. So shut your fucking mouth, and fuck you, too, you sleazy cunt.
Sorry. My hands are rough from carving. What's it gonna be? I don't know yet. We'll see. Every piece of wood is different. You're supposed to...
Yeah, it's a great book. So you've read it? Well, yeah. Funny I thought that was the only surviving copy. You know what? I meant to read it, but the library was always out
Come. Come. - Go! You too come soon, brother. You won't benefit from this land.
You are troubling me even after dying! If you had been alive, I would have strangulated and killed you! Have you gone mad! What are you doing! What are you doing!
Why ten days? Anything can happen in ten days. Call up the inspector and get the money quickly. Have patience. If you generate too much heat the grain will be charred.
So you wear bracelets in your legs? Well.. Actually, it's a two-in-one bracelet, sir. This bracelet is more of an anklet. When I sleepwalk in the night, I wear it in my leg.
Well.. Actually, it's a two-in-one bracelet, sir. This bracelet is more of an anklet. When I sleepwalk in the night, I wear it in my leg. Are you sure it belongs to you?
If anyone finds a red-haired baby with a girl in her early twenties" arrest her at once. - Sir. Believe me, I didn't do anything, sir. You won't confess like this.
- Well... - By your pause, I understand. Because I think a woman can be obsessed with a movie star like Brad Pitt - hello! - and I could be obsessed with Angelina - I just want to wet her lips and stick her to something. And also you could say obsessed with rock 'n' roll stars - women rushing the stage, fainting, for Elvis, for the Beatles, for Mick Jagger, just to say, "This is your baby!" But women don't rush the stage for comedians.
I'll send this expedition. - Okay. - You are the most experienced. Soon the signal will end? It must have an automatic transmitter.
So how are we supposed to get the flame to stay next to the meat? You've got a point. The secret of our trade's passed on from father to son! Mercy me. Beautiful girls everywhere.
You're already on a case? You haven't changed. I gotta hand it to you. You know what I nicknamed him? Mr. Urologist'
I'll leave the fucking force! Shut the fuck up! It's not over yet. We'll get them. I will!
The first tactics that use he is tentarte to the sin. Mainly when he is young because it is indeed when all these things begin. When one is young, the sin does not seem to be something very important. It seems something attractive, in fact something likeable, fleecy. But the sin is planned for destruirte.
Hey, fellas, gather up. Here's the thing. When you drink, the shape of the boot causes an air bubble to form in the toe. The bubble. This air bubble shoots around the heel and explodes towards your face while drinking.
I mean, come on. Cut it. This sweet nectar was my lifeblood. Oh, yeah, Landfill. Go for it, my friend.
Like us. I don't know about that... but there's something outside and there's more than one of them. So I figure, in the morning, right as the sun comes over the horizon... -we run for it. -Run for what? The car.
Like to take a look at those myself. Right, I will go first. Pavel goes last. Please, do not get separated. These people are getting worse every day. All right?
That was GM's failure, on those batteries. Once they put good batteries in, they didn't have any problems. Ultimately, GM sold its share in Ovshinsky's company to an unlikely buyer. Then, when the Ni-MH batteries were improved, so that they're now lasting longer than the life of the car and cheaper than an engine, Chevron Texaco stepped in and purchased control from General Motors of Ovshinsky technology.
Unable to change policy, activists staged a funeral to raise public awareness. It was the same month as the first stage 1 smog alert in southern California in five years. I was an EV1 driver, still am, from 1998 until December of this year, when GM will have to pry it out of my charger's dead cold hands. What the detractors and the critics of electric vehicles have been saying for years is true. The electric vehicle is not for everybody.
I've said this time and time again. People will buy anthing you convince them to buy. Feed people enough, and they believe that's a diet. Consumers, they couldn't see the difference between electric car and the car they're already driving because they don't read environmental impact. They don't read political instability caused by oil production in the Middle East.
There's still roughly a trillion barrels worth of oil in the Earth's crust. And if you figure that the average price of that subsequent oil will be 100 $ a barrel, that's a 100 trillion dollars worth of business yet to be done. However, at some point when an alternative is good enough, people will snap over, and that's what the oil companies fear the most. We use 180 million gallons of gasoline a week in California. Right now, the price is 2,20 $.
It came in about every 5000 miles. We'd rotate the tires, add washer fluid to it, and send it back out on the street. It's amazing. Look how dirty I've gotten just handling this stuff. It's kind of sad.
in our country. And when we think about censorship, what's being censored are scenes in movies, which mean nothing to these people. And of course, what's not being regulated is the ways in which these corporations control the flow of information. In the recording industry, the film industry, TV industry, radio, press, everything. And by the time it's completed, we have three, maybe... maybe two companies that essentially own access to our culture. It'll be impossible to break up.
See...didn't I tell you. That it must be the boy who drowned in the pool? I've seen ghosts like this before. At my old house... a motorcycle crashed rounding the corner at night. The driver flew off his bike and died instantly. After that night I'd hear the same motorbike skid around the corner almost every night.
I'm your new assistant. Did you get the crease under the hairline? Yes, Willie. 20 years, Marc. No one has done more, worked harder...
300 parts per million. Now, as I said, they can also measure temperature. Here's what the temperature has been on our Earth. Now, one thing that kind of jumps out at you is... Well, let me put it this way.
The possibility of losing what was most precious to me. I gained an ability that maybe I didn't have before. But when I felt it, I felt that we could really lose it, that what we take for granted might not be here for our children. These are actual measurements of atmospheric temperatures since our Civil War.
Way, way above everyone else. If you take population into account, it's a little bit different. China's playing a bigger role, so is Europe. But we are still by all odds the largest contributor. And so it is up to us to look at how we think about it, because our way of thinking is the third and final factor that transforms our relationship to the Earth.

It's different when they're your own children. Now, it may seem like that. Just wait and see. Dad, why are you wearing that hat? That's a new habit. He even wears it when guests come over. This hat has more uses than you think.
Yes, he played like the foreigners. And his hair? I've got a better story. Some women in white scarves stood near the Bahraini bus. So, they had to let 'em in.
Search him. Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved. - Chemical response team, we need you here. - Copy that. On the way.
I got it! Sorry, it just came to me. I play a lot of Sudoku. Excuse me, I'll just... if you could... I'll tell you more.
But you should know that no one's coming for you. We intercepted your message. Nice try. My message didn't go throh a relay. it went directly to my people. That's not true exactly.
Not exactly. I understand you belted him once. Yeah... That was something that I did without really thinking. Don't apologize.
I just want to know why. It's what you said at the ceremony before the attack when Galactica was being decommissioned. You gave a speech that sounded like it wasn't the one you prepared. You said that humanity was a flawed creation. And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed.
Before you know it, crazy becomes normal. Huh! Ha! Huh! Huh? Huh? Ow! Ow - Easy.
He never ostracized her when she got divorced, never demanded... she get job, never asked her how she spent her money... never came home smelling like another woman... and he never made Beverly his trophy. Barry Mani low was simply there for Beverly. In fact, Barry Mani low treated Beverly better than most other husbands did. Now, he may be very ill now... but there's a slight chance that he can recover. We need to hold onto that chance.
Not the dense kind. Sponge cake. Fluffy. - Where's Tommy? - He has a meeting this morning. Well, tell him he needs to pick up the liquor at Breen's. Pete McGonagle's expecting him.
Eileen, please, please, please get Tommy to take Jimmy back. You know how stubborn tommy is once he's made up his mind. I know how persuasive you can be once you've made up your mind. Creamed asparagus. Mary Kate, watch the stew.
Excuse me, miss? I was wondering if you could tell me which room you sent the man with the head bandage to? Is this an official police matter? Yes, it is. I sent him to room 1008, a Mr. John Smith.
Lieutenant, Mr. Riley is a top level informant in an on-Going federal investigation. Moe Riley is a known criminal asshole guilty of murder. You have no direct physical evidence. His ear was found next to the vic's body. No, no, no. It wasn't his ear.
Is that why you own a gun? Well, I used to. But my gun was stolen out of my purse, one night when we went out. Is there something you want to say to me? You trying to buy back some time there, Mrs. Wannamaker?
What's in the jar ? That's how we build our target database. "Target ?" It's a seminar term. Girls write their names, numbers, they put them in the jar, they get on our list.
That's how we build our target database. "Target ?" It's a seminar term. Girls write their names, numbers, they put them in the jar, they get on our list. And then they invite their friends.
Great. Hey, could've happened when I brought that chick up there. You-you can't prove a thing. - Here's the thing... that aroma dispenser... it was on a timer. We were able to pinpoint exactly what time the pheromones were disbursed into the room.
Oh, if you take a spider and you wrap it in a raisin and swallow it... it's supposed to be a remedy for malaria. Delicious. I mean, stella, this woman has a medical degree from a prestigious school. Sounds like she was moonlighting as an alternative healer. So Dr. Jeffries was using the leeches to treat Paul and she was on her way to bringing them to the basement when she was shot.
That's your print. So what ? I handle paint from the warehouse, A lot of people do it. But you handled this one... as a weapon, leaving a full print... on top of all the others.
She told me... and I told her that I would take care of it. And that's when you fired the gun. You knew we'd find GSR. I shot the gun into the ground outside of my house. I used a towel to muffle the sound.
The sisters think it's way too dangerous. When used out of control, yes. So can you help me control it? Come. That penjing tree is a simple living creature within the world surrounding us.
Just your average tackily dressed demons. There were some other guys with these kind of red gown, robe-y things. They must be after the staff. - Buddha's staff. - No, don't touch it.
- You know, or maybe it was just... - Me. Well, no, it couldn't have just been you. I mean, that was a pretty powerful transformation down there. Well, tell that to these flowers.
All right. Where do I find the mark? How's it going? Not good. They've split up and they keep moving around.
Craig, I strongly advise you to stop talking. Meredith Burke knows what you felt. She's Miles Burke's wife. They have two little girls so small. They don't know what to make of this.
This guy's life was falling apart. He needed money. He never meant to kill anyone. Well, he did. What if I can get you the body?
He ended up with multiple stab wounds and a collapsed left lung And he still managed to call 911? He's a trained surgeon.He knew not to panic The evidence against Mr. Jackson is overwhelming is overwhelming. -Almost too overwhelming
Let's confront Dr. Towers with the evidence see if he can find a clever way out Doctor, if you don't mind,I'd like you to walks us through what happened the night of the attack just one more time Walk you through it? You know, with all due respect, how much more do you people need? Austin's prints are on the knife
Nice chair. I don't have one of these suckers and I started this firm. What can I do for you, Dad? Remember my idea about having our biggest client buy up that block, clear it out, put up a skyscraper? Dad, I believe the Lockhart Tower was my idea.
Now, I got to get back to work, but I don't want to go until I know that you know, it's all good. All good. - It's all good? - All good! All good, my ass.
Well, you can't expect an old fart like me to do it. I'll break my hip. Okay, okay. Dad, I'm home ! What happened to the power ?
Do you come to me placated, Mr. Swearengen? Never more so, not even as a tiny tot. Let's hear the speeches together. Show me your hole in the wall, which I find a useful advance. De Tocqueville said,
One never quite knows when one needs one's doctor. It appears undamaged. Do you think it will still work? You broke the bond with the ship when you moved it. Which means it was off-line when the mirror broke. That's what saved it.
This place won't last long. So, what do you think? Why don't you kids take your time and call me after you've talked it over? Just close the door behind you when you leave. Wow, look at these. If I get this big, I think I'm gonna, like, kill myself.
- It's a baseball card. Al Oliver. He played in Pittsburgh. Lifetime 330 hitter. That card is going to be worth thousands of dollars someday.
Strange,huh? Whoever did this was obviously an expert. Same thick brush strokes,same color palette. Even has clete's mark in the corner. But as we know,dead men don't paint.
Buddhists call it Karma. Christians call it the Golden Rule. Jews call it... I don't know, Rabbi Hillel said something poignant. Universe always settles the score. Does it? No.
And if you have the test, and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose nearly 100, right? No arrhythmia, so Ritalin isn't the big problem. Something else is going on. Fine, let's play doctors.
First thing that comes into your mind. Hold... this... and this... Whoa! There she goes. Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.
Battleship. I've never lost a game. Neither have I. Of course I cheat. Oh, yeah, me, too.
business gifts to people who've never been born. But that was quite a while ago. Whatever happened in there this morning, I'm sure can be fixed. Let me tell you what's going to happen because of what didn't happen in there this morning. Judge Swan is going to cite our firm, you're going to be reported to the state bar, and my best friend could lose everything.
Next time maybe you should consider knocking! I thought I taught you at least that much about life. Oh, my god, you are so beautiful. I had no idea how beautiful you would be. At first the boxes
What will this one do? Will it make the chickens stop talking? Huh? I bet you don't hear chickens, Craig. No, Ted, I don't hear chickens.
Ugh, what a visual. Oh, God. Mom... you're in pain, aren't you? No. Well, yes.
Where are you right now? I'm just, uh... just inside the border. The guys at Woodburn said I could get drugs in Mexico. Teddy, no! No! Do not buy meds in Mexico, Teddy.
Do I buy or lease the little lady? Uh, it's hard to say, you know. It depends on the person. I usually buy. Yeah, but then you're stuck with the car.
Lean in... with the shoe! Lean in! We've been here... for half an hour. The shoes aren't going on! They're two sizes too small.
Al! And do my eyes look a little Black? I'm serious! No come on Al you got embraced. I sure did. No it's called the vampire's embrace, they're just like...
No come on Al you got embraced. I sure did. No it's called the vampire's embrace, they're just like... This lesbian vampire goth codes... so what they do, is they pick a victim... they like take 'em home seduce them, fuck 'em blind... You don't even now...
because those people are my friends. Your friends weren't really friendly to me. What? I just... I feel like... I just don't really fit in you know.
What about George Bush... he's a total dickhead. When what about is dick? I... think that's really... that... the... question we need to put to the Democrats, why are we not talking George Bush's penis? You know with all the times that the Republican talked about Bill Clinton's penis. You know, we knew its... its shape, we knew its size...
Take that, society. Next! Hi, Dewey. How was school? Terrible!
Next! Hi, Dewey. How was school? Terrible! I missed the school bus because I didn't know what time it was, and then I was late for a spelling test because I didn't know what time it was, and then David Klausner beat me up because I didn't know what time it was!
- There's no radiation, no side-effects. Dr. Sooran said she wouldn't even charge us a dime. You already spoke to her? Not about the psychic stuff. Just about getting scanned for the girls.
Something the matter? I-I don't know. I can't seem to find my car. You don't remember what level you parked it on? No, I-I thought...
- I don't either, Randy... - My God, I'm gonna vomit! - Hey, Earl? - Yeah, Randy? - Do you think an ostrich can get all the way here from the right choice ranch?
- My God, I'm gonna vomit! - Hey, Earl? - Yeah, Randy? - Do you think an ostrich can get all the way here from the right choice ranch? - Yeah, I think it could walk, that distance if it really wanted to.
Cool. Hey, say "Moose" and "Squirrel." ( with heavy Russian accent ): Moose and Squirrel. Yup. That's how I thought she'd say it. JASPER: It's not bad, huh?
Try blowing on it. Excuse me? There you go. ( clears throat ): Thank you, sir. I could see that karma wasn't punishing Mr. Patrick.
The urn contained burnt wood chips concrete, dust and pebbles. The ashes are bogus. What kind of guy lives in a coffin-storage shed at a funeral home. Perhaps a poor one. I'd buy that, except for the fact that it looks like this guy did an episode of Trading Spaces with Satan.
Yeah, well, all those schmucks who play the game for fun, they think it's cheating. Well, those are the same schmucks that should stick to slot machines. Well, you see, that's why I like playing poker. 'Cause I can handle the ones that try to take advantage. Poker, I mean, you got to have a mind, a pair of eyes.
Oh? Tough day? We just got these two missing girls from India. - India? - Yeah.
Now, based on what information we do have, I can reveal the most likely locations and times for the unrecorded stops. Imagine you held a candle to the bottom of a treasure map to reveal the sections written in invisible ink. I don't know, Charlie, it still feels like we're pretty much guessing about where he went. Okay, yeah, a little a-at first. But this log is extensive.
So you're saying Rhimes' killer is responsible for ten murders? No, far more. I mean, he may have pulled the trigger on those ten murders, but they aren't his only victims. Right, because of all the retaliation shootings, you mean. Right. When you include all the victims from these ten shooting chains, you've got yourself one person setting off over 60 murders. Hey, guys, listen up.
How many lives we save because of it? Then why don't you tell me how a gun that you signed for ends up back on the street in the hands of a killer. Who the hell knows; security's not perfect at these things, a lot of people come through here. Now, we probably took 50 guns off the street that day. If one of them sliped through, got back out, that's still 49 others that we took in.
Okay, what's that? And when we choose, we're left with our choi... Oh, my God, you're listening to your own voice. You see, all the TV shows I watch, all these women have voice-overs. They even gave one to April on The Valley.
It's the look my dad goes for. Um, and this a list of nonnegotiable qualifications that she must possess. Mental stability, crossword enthusiast, loves horses... Must have own money, plastic-surgery-free, fluent in Italian. This doesn't leave much wiggle room, Summer.
I need you to beat this, Christina. - And I'm not the only one. You can bring such hope. People are too stupid to fix themselves. It's too late.
He had a partner. I have to find that guy? I'm confused. When do you start chipping in? See, your information was good.
Those 100 repeating genes: membrane pumps. Membrane is porous. So whatever gets into the bacterium, if the bacterium doesn't like it just pumps them right out. But why would it need 100 pumps?
Hey, Caroline, how's it going? We heard from David. Yeah? That's good news. Is he coming back? I'm sure he will.
No. I was married twice. Divorced one, the other died. Wrong one died. Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something called systemic amyloidosis. Now, it's in your liver now, but it'll eventually shut down all your organs.
Yeah, Chloe's on her way to pick you up. Okay, bye. Newspaper's got it wrong, huh? No. They didn't.
i've lived this day before. i kind of went back in time. right. what did you do, spin the earth backwards on its axis ? come on, you didn't manage to pick up the lottery numbers while you were at it, did you ? see these flowers ?
What does it say? "And those who are prideful and refuse to bow down shall be laid low and made unto dust." Is that all it says? Yeah, that's it. Open a channel?
Made a stop over at O'Hara before continuing on to its final destination, Charles de Gaulle airport. You're telling me the virus has already reached Paris? Three of the people on that flight have tested positive for the virus. French authorities are doing all that they can to track down the passengers, flight crew, any ground crew or airport personnel that may have come into contact with them. And anyone who came into contact with them, and anyone who came into contact with those people.

As an Ancient how could you not have known? Of course I knew Sam. But I had no choice. But you have a choice now. Your brain is fighting a losing battle.
Your front yard- weeds are overgrown. No, really. Citation 621-J2. 621 's your yard. J2's weeds. Gotta get a weed whacker.
Then she's stealing from the united states army, and i can bump it to my superiors. Uh, tiffy mentioned to me special circumstances. What do you have in mind? We want to get her attention. Suspend payment on her next check.
Well,yes,you were,robert. Ok. My plaid shirt. Is it a school day,mommy? Yes,darling.
I ended up telling the janitor that your locker was mine and I forgot my combination so he'd open it up and I could leave you a little surprise. But I made it before I heard they dropped the charges, so keep that in mind. You lied to a janitor? I've resigned myself to burning in hell. You know, all the girls on track are jealous of me.
You lied to a janitor? I've resigned myself to burning in hell. You know, all the girls on track are jealous of me. I'm sure they could burn in hell, too, if they'd just put in the effort. No.
- We could be winning... - You've done a hell of a job. The nuclear thing, there's no way you could have anticipated that. In a few seconds, six states will close their polls. Once all the precincts in those states are closed we'll be able to start bringing you the results of this election.
This is not how allies are suppose to treat each other. Granted we got our butts kicked but we still need each other if we're gonna survive. Our sensors detect your shields at minimum. If you do not capitulate immediately we will open fire. You'd be destroying the only other ship out here with life support capabilities.
But there it is. 'Anything we can do? ' No, I'm all right. It's just... Gets into your head, this thing.
Please. You're burning me. Inside. Behind my eyes. It hurts. Even my memories hurt.
So I'm ordering you, sir, tell me what's going on! She won't stop. She never stops. We started hearing stories, all round the place. People who have changed.
Now he's... he could be deadfor all I know, and that-- that was my fault. I take responsibility for that, and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns. I want two guns, John! I'm sorry, Jack, that's the way it's gonna be, Jack. Two guns.
David. Those documents were provided to us by Wilke and Price. They were more than willing to cooperate once we alerted them to the possible irregularities in the account. What irregularities? As you can see, the account was opened with an initial deposit of $50,000.
I don't know, he's, like... six or seven, maybe. Sweet. God, he seemed so sweet. Tyler. His name's Tyler. Tyler.
We were friends. I wouldn't hurt her. Did she say anything to you over the phone that might explain what happened to her? No. But while we were talking, she asked me to stop by when I got out. I just didn't know. Some people like apple, some like pecan, others, blueberry.
Tomatoes? What, like they were gonna attack you? No. I just hated them. I hated the little gross seeds. I hated the pulpy pulpiness. I hated everything about them.
I put the word out with patrol... You know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight thing. Juan Pierre flagged this one and called me. This is a busy street. Anyone see the driver?
No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack. So, um, I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts. Yeah, it is fun. Morning. Oh, my God, I got flowers.
Morning. Oh, my God, I got flowers. They're on my desk and you assume they're for you? Oh, I'm so sorry. They're for you.
Hey, did you get the flowers I sent? You sent. Of course. Thank you so much. I love them.
Apparently, that's not a problem. Anyway, I was just wondering if, hopefully, there might be another opportunity to.... Well, someone is popular today. Check it out. These flowers kick those flowers' ass.
Flipping burgers is work. This weekend's going to be fine. Maybe even fun? Yes, fun. Oh, hey, I left April's bike in the garage.
The girls know. - What? How? - I don't know. Summer confronted me yesterday, and then I had to tell Marissa.
Yeah, well, we drained it a few months ago and filled it up with trash, and nobody found no body. Yeah, well, you wouldn't if you weren't looking for it, but we will be. Not now, you're not. If I shut down, I lose ten grand a minute. well,... you want to lose another ten arguing about it, or do you want to let us get to work ?
I'll take your arguments into consideration, and I'll have a decision within a few hours. These little bastards are the bane of my existence, I swear to God. You get this a lot? Yeah, they're attracted to the heat when they're cold, plus, they got collapsible vertebrae or some deal, so they can squeeze through a crack yea big, if they're determined. And he shorted out the wire just by biting on it?
Leo loved you. You knew that, right? I don't know how he could have done it without you. You remember that trip to Seattle during the first campaign? When he couldn't find his umbrella, so you grabbed a garbage can to hold over him?
He cares about me. I care about you. And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine. You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything.
Fine. Go ahead and glow it up. Katara, I'm just being realistic. I don't have time to do this the right way. This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant.
A few hours later he's covered in injuries and stiff as a board. I told you what'd happen if you put him in with me. I'm not the one who should be examining my conscience. What happened in there? He wanted the bed.
It's not the way bob and i do it. I thought you said serena was christened. I just assumed... yes, she was. She saw my two girls praying, she wanted to join in.
You men. I thought: Take this job. Identify the problems. Fix the problems. But it's a cancer now.
I just think it would be the height of hubris for us to claim for fact that we know what we would do when faced with that kind of pressure. But that's just one reporter's opinion. We created her. Out of thin air. I just don't care how funny the picture is.
Very festive. I'm sorry about that. I'll have a floor guy come fix it. Well, don't worry about it. The house was too perfect.
He had it the whole time. Dad, what? When you searched the place, Did you see a gun, an antique, a colt revolver? Did you see it?
-What do you want with my car? Wow. It's yours. It's just that my dad is super into them, and he's always talked about getting a "souped-up 'cuda". That car belonged to my dear departed husband, bless his soul.
Him or me. My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. You draw up a map to your balloon, we go out there, we find it. And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.
They charged him of fraud for telling the American people the truth about the income tax laws. The jury obviously agreed with Joe. Well it just showed Mr. Banister to be honest and straightforward, and working within the law. Wernest Cougland, a Federal Express pilot claimed there was no law requiring Americans to file an income tax, she also won in court. 24 people were criminally charged by the IRS, because they claimed there was no law requiring them to file an income tax return.
Who owns the Federal Reserve? It's secret and we can't find out what's happening, so, but the Congress created it, and it's not authorized in the Constitution. The Government borrows money from a private corporation useing the name 'federal' that prints United States on it. And then it pays back to the Fed, which is owned by private banks. We don't know who all those private banks are. The money that the government is paying back to the private bankers is the money that comes from you and me.
The Ood, how do they communicate? I mean, with each other? Oh,just empaths. There's a low-level telepathic field connecting them. Not that that does them much good. They're basically a herd race, like cattle.
Derek, do you want to put some music on? Yeah. Who wants guacamole and margaritas? Mmm. Me. Good.
- Time to what? - To live. - What are you saying? - Don't be worried. I'm just telling you how I feel.
And multinational. You kidnap young woman from El Salvador and get them to work for you as slaves. You kidding me? They want to come. Work a few years, pay off some debts.
No, you barely know him. He is not the same man you see at work. Don't you think it'd be wise to slow down right now? I want to have a life like everybody else. What if the cancer comes back?
too good a man to lie. i'll read your mind. his timing is off, his rhythm is off. this man has no business calling himself eugene foote. you understand, sir, that in the months since the initial surgery, scar tissue has formed around the pacemaker?
Why is it that you feel the need to lob a grenade at every guy that I date ? Quiet. He's here. Hey ! It's amazing what you can learn when you're a fly on the wall.
My cake ! Clark, your mom thought we might want to share some of the leftover birthday cake. Well, I'm sure there's a goat on this farm that will appreciate my knack for batter. You handled the whole party thing really well, by the way. Thanks.
It's about knowing how deep you want to get involved and knowing when to say stop. Lana, what I'm about to show you... Means you're all-in... 100%. What is this place ? The future.
Not without a bone. I'll take the truth. I assure you the vaccine is processed and ready... But I'd be foolish to hand it over to someone whose agenda is still up for grabs. Lex, it's a vaccine.
Yeah, I know. So let me scan this and see if we got any. Why would fine want to expose himself now ? He's afraid I'm going to help you to stop what he and Lex are planning to do. Which is what ?
Maybe that's what this pattern is trying to warn me against. I have a strong sense that this warning I have been entrusted to pass on is related to something more terrible even than the virus. Maybe the virus is just a part of it. Yeah. Do you have access to the lab ?
"In the evening, at night." "If it weren't for those horrible, agonizing, sleepless nights, I would never write." But this way I'm continually reminded of the darkness of my solitary confinement. I can't write during the day. The light distracts my attention.
He called me the greatest friend, and equally the greatest enemy, of his work. I had given him quite a dressing down at the Askanischer Hof, almost shouted at him in fact. He remained mute or stammered in dismay. When he announced that he and Felicehad separated, he suddenly began to cry. It was the only time I saw him cry.
A delivery truck pulls up, blocks our view. For how long? Two, three minutes, tops. What kind of truck? Bread, dairy... I can't remember. Did you have an alarm?
You just wandered in here by accident. Slipped into the wrong suite by mistake. I came here for Lia's things, for her bag. That's it. Now I have no idea what you're talking about, Michael.
Sorry. Spreadsheets. Bane of my existence. Combines my hatred of math with my fear of little, tiny boxes. Well, little, tiny boxes can be scary.
Just wait till the first time you don't bring home the dry cleaning. Dude, this is my day. Can we not talk about dry cleaning? - Absolootie. - Thank you.
If they say that men are responsible for themselves, .. We will not say he is responsible for his own individuality. The Catholics blame sordid human nature on stress. Everything is dirty and slimy and is suspicious. They accuse you of writing against God. I am not against god because I am without god. 'Being' is the existence beforehand. Does that mean that God give us up.
But I don't want just part of your heart. I want all of it, and you can't promise me that. Flight 63 to Los Angeles now boarding. Listen to me. When I first came to Everwood, I had a serious drug problem, and I knew it, but I tried to ignore it.
Well, that's true. I just haven't seen that side of him before. Of course, I've only known him for five days. I like that he's edgy. Because I'm edgy, too.
Well, I'm staying. I'm staying, too. I'm sure Abby feels safer already. I see you've vacated the elevator for the evening. It wasn't quite so cozy in there after an hour with Queen Boudicca.
Some of these women have criminal records, right? Drugs, prostitution. A few, yeah. But they would never hurt Breck. You seem pretty sure about that. Put it this way, our women come to Shield House to start over.
- Okay, look. I've been going over this Sotheby's list of everything Breck sold them. There's jewelry, silver, watches. Net worth: Over $30,000. But the interesting item is a vase worth close to five grand.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut! He wouldn't be able to yell with his mouth wired shut. The bottom line is... this is not the man on the phone. I bagged a cell phone inside. I found it on the couch next to where you were lying.
It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists and diehard modern hippies young and old. I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord.
Who? You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse! noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here. This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength. The smug?
The nine-millimeters are trickier, but I got a definite match on the Beretta and the Tec-nine. That leaves us with... this final round the runt of the litter. Ducky said it went in through the back and lodged in the chest plate. Kill shot. The rifling was almost stripped.
Okay. But... it's bad. When we first crashed here, I thought this isn't all bad. It's like the all-mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing, but I did drop a couple belt sizes.
i don't date women over 35. 40 if i'm drinking. all right, then. you can have her back by 7:00, 'cause i have a dinner i cannot miss. mr. milbrook, thank you so much for stopping by. how goes your motion for a mistrial?
Yeah,but then you ended up in the back alley,right,talking to russo? What,you think it was his fault that you got fired? I was never in that alley. Hair...from the kinka-poodle,or what is it? Got on you,and it transferred to russo,right? You know what "transferred" means,blake?
What,you think it was his fault that you got fired? I was never in that alley. Hair...from the kinka-poodle,or what is it? Got on you,and it transferred to russo,right? You know what "transferred" means,blake? He was nowhere near the animal-- it was in another car.
I should have listened to you. You were right. - I did not mean to do it-- - Shh, shh, shh. The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
Uh... 58 seconds. Charles, what is it? I need to talk to Don. We searched that storage locker that Justin Price rented. Found some unused ammo.
If you're not careful, she's gonna wanna move in. Would that be so bad? Hey, I don't have a lot of rules around here but nine of the top ten are just different ways of saying: "Women are not allowed to live here." They come and they go.
Where's a sitter when you need one? And we're back in court on the Arrow lake water case. Opposing counsel is relentless. Yet another evidentiary hearing. Denise, per your status report,
Maybe she was a girlfriend. Or maybe she was just trying to jerk you around. I spoke to every one of the nurses on that floor. The patient only had six visitors, two females, no babes. His mother and his aunt.
Gillick is very good. Your recovery time... This stomach kills me, my neck is throbbing. My leg feels better. That's amazing. It's unbelievable.
He was questioned because he was a stranger to a particular neighborhood. Now, did officer Ryleson come to that conclusion in part because he was African-American? Yes. He admitted that. But where's the line between racial profiling and common sense?
Why's that? What do you know about it? - You're a childless old maid. - Take a powder, Helen. Women all over this city live by the advice in "Dear Lo."
Not feeling too hot. You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll give you a hand. Yeah. Hey, thanks for coming out here, risking your neck for my boy. - Live together, die alone, man.
I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that. I found another hatch. Another station on the island. They called it the Pearl. And I saw a film there.
Where? Out and about. You mean right here in Boston? It's the most convenient locale. Don't do that, man.
She's been clean for five years. Denise Bauer, attorney, Daniel Post. Guy dying of cancer. You're going off like a dog, aren't you? What do you mean?
Does anybody know who these kids are? No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days. Excuse me, Excuse me.
Well, Stochastic, sure, Markovian, maybe, but Brownian? Let me see. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I do see this. See what? What? Picture a pool table... with a cueball in constant motion.
Fuck what they say. This here's police work, and I'm asking if you police. All right. Listen up, you mutts. This is complicated.
Easy. Yeah. I might have known I'd find you boys in here, burning that oil after hours. Nigger, I'ma kill you twice. Oh? So you don't want your shipment, huh? Say your piece.
Sorry, remind me, how many men do you have? Twenty-four. - And he has? - One. But the point... But you let him take the house.
Please? Let's go. Up. Up. Is Claire okay? Did she have the baby?
This is the price that these cave commuters must pay for their daytime sanctuary on the ground. Small wonder then that there are other cave dwellers that stay put. Many caves are like islands... cut off from the outside world and from other caves. This isolation has resulted in the evolution of some various strange creatures. They are the cave specialists... troglodytes, animals that never emerge from the caves or see daylight.
And the Belizean white crab is another creature that is unique to just one cave system. Living in perpetual darkness they have all not only lost the pigment in their skin, but also their eyes. It takes thousands of generations for eyes to be lost, so these species must have been isolated for a very long time. But the blind salamander has other highly developed sensory organs. Receptors in their skin detect minute movements in the water made by its prey.
Another band of stalwart heroes come to tempt fate in the hopes of claiming the legendary prize. - What do you know of the Sangraal? - Only what I have heard from legend. That it is located in a cave beyond the outlying forest, but that the journey there is fraught with peril. Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay enchanted the area with a terrible curse.
Do you know why? Because I'm leaving you. You see, Sancho? Chivalry is civilization. It rewards those who tell the truth.
Look at how strong you are now. Don't you see? - Aren't you? - Yes. Look up. This tree is beautiful too.
Nothing that might indicate early symptoms of sudden onset monsterism? I am fine. Actually, you are. There's no signs of radiation poisoning. No evidence of genetic manipulation.
Paul was making his getaway with what he thought was a stolen ticket. He was rich. it was the happiest three minutes of his life. And over the next several days, the ticket made its way through camden county, just waiting for karma to deliver it to the right person. if willie the one-eyed mailman had better depth perception... that ticket could've been his.
And over the next several days, the ticket made its way through camden county, just waiting for karma to deliver it to the right person. if willie the one-eyed mailman had better depth perception... that ticket could've been his. some people could've even quit their day jobs, but they were too busy working to notice. some people could've had it, but karma wanted them to find other things instead. things like love.
Yep,a lot of people could've had that ticket. But it just wasn't meant to be. it was almost as if the ticket knew where it was supposed to go. Okay,fine, you took the lotto ticket instead of helping me, but that ticket was yours. Why don't you want the money?
We've been here before. You know what? Save a tree. Say it out loud. I'm prepared to offer you $4 million. Four? OK, first let me counter by saying fuck you.
Authorities have decided to declare the high alert yellow flag Mexico City and outlying areas in a state of panic. Roads are clogged, people are being forced onto buses, families are a little girl lost in the chaos of the evacuation. Airlines have cancelled all flights to the Mexixo City airport. The fucking water in the Gulf of Mexico! OK. Ocean water has a pH level of 8.5, right?
Look, to show you there are no hard feelings, here's the rest of it. And that's the last you're going to get from me. The point I'm trying to make is that Western society is starting to accept homosexuality. - Slowly, but yes. - Yeah, but come on, it's come a long way.
Who's winnin'? Uh, I wasn't really watching'. Really? How's life, sheriff? Get up, still in the mirror, no complaints.
The storm caused a sandbato form at the north end of the bay. - Right. -The shift in the bottom features disrupted the tidal flow. All right, so it's like a car race. The flow around the track is even and thus predictable. But let's say there's a crash-- the flow is disrupted, cars have to steer around the wreckage.
I can hardly go chasing her across the country. What do you need? That container-- it's gone. It's already been unloaded. But the port says they use some kind of a security algorithm.
- There's something I have to do. - What's that? Alright, well, I wanna rap this up and do what my dad would have really wanted. Get on with the party! And thank you all so much for coming out here tonight. To celebrate Raife Davies' life. His wild, uncensored, outrageous life.
Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls, no good can come from it. Unless, you know, it's 2 a.m., she's blind drunk and wants to get even with her new cheating boyfriend. She just wanted to invite us to the ballet. Yeah, right. And girls are completely unaware that you can see their nipples through their shirts. What does that have to...?
Look, I don't wanna say anything bad about the guy, but he was in rehab twice. Heroin, you know. It's a bitch to kick. Prior to the movie in Chatsworth, when was the last time you worked with Chris Mundy? A few days before on Raymond loves everybody. And did you check his HIV status then?
I don't need to take a test. You don't want me to find out that you have HIV, do you? Because that would suddenly give you a very good reason for killing your husband. My husband did not have AIDS, and neither do I. You can only live in denial for so long, Annalisa.
so you know it's a long vowel sound and not a short one. And sometimes I like to dot the "I" with a little smiley face or a heart or something. Something to brighten the reader's day. I asked you what your name was. Honey, you keep that up, it's whatever you want it to be.
- You signed papers? No, this guy don't work with papers, man. He's back. He's holding me to my contract. What about the deal I got you?
Your friend Gaeta was on the welcoming committee. Look at me. Long as you're here, maybe you can help me out. I'm missing something. I lost it in detention.
How do you feel? This is Ann. And what I'm gonna do is, if we preface this one with a short sentence and say... "Bishops, archbishops, and cardinals have consistently lied to us and to the public and to law enforcement agencies about the cover-up of sexual abuse by the clergy, period. " We'll address it to the Pope, and it'll be from you specifically, but speaking in the name of all those who have been victimized and molested, and I'm gonna put it in language that they will... direct language they'll understand.
Perhaps that's where some of the problems began in that... in Ann's situation. There are two types of people in the Church: The hierarchy in the sacred pastures, as they call them, who are picked out by God to lead, and the vast throng who are the lay people, and their duty is to be docile, obedient followers. It says that. The system, it's a monarchy.
As of June 2002, we had over 100 criminal investigations ongoing, and that encompassed over 100 individual priests. What that tells you is how large the scope of this problem is. I think the Vatican is looking for a way to say "We've solved this," and they are scapegoating... because so many of the victims were male victims, they're scapegoating the homosexual priests and saying "If we get rid of the homosexual priests, then we'll be rid of this problem. " Most men who abuse children are heterosexual. The Bishops' Conference, I think, would like to project that this problem is now over with.
Okay. Thank you for doing this, Thomas. I know an open house at the Center isn't your favorite Sunday activity. I love a good barbecue. You've been spending a lot of time here.
Synchronisation: Derud, Harkot. h I thought you said this planet was uninhabited. According to the Ancient database.
Is that what's interfering with the radio communications? The Genii must have found this place, activated it somehow, and they couldn't figure out how to turn it off, so they did what any other good soldier would do in their situation. Shot the hell out of it. Looks like it's healing itself. That's the beauty of hybrid organic design.
Glad to see you've got it all worked out. - Definitely not all. - Some? Well, actually, very little. Look, I can only surmise that it's some sort of Wraith experiment.
Arclight, this is Roundhouse Zero-Six. Do you read? We just lost contact with the UAV. E.M. interference? I don't think so...
Do you read? We just lost contact with the UAV. E.M. interference? I don't think so... The signal was terrible, so I had it boosted so at least we were reading something, but then all of a sudden it just disappeared.
Bye! It's a real shame, you know. If you want to start smoking, these are the business. I don't want to start. For me, cigarettes are valuable things.
What happened, did you switch off your radio? I'm coming from the TV station area. I've been trying to get hold of you for over an hour. I'm in trouble, Viorel, one of my soldiers has run away. How come?
- Come on. Thank you. And what do they have there? Corn, I said. It's ours.
Try the base's frequency. They might know the password. I say it's the same password. We're under army command. Go ahead. "The paper will be blue."
What did you want to celebrate? Remember you sent me a Lucky tree? It blossomed today. Really? That's really rare.
Professor, How's your head? I guess I'm fine. Can you get up? Oh no, the car...
No. It's the Smart House. A state-of-the-art model home, designed to anticipate its owner's every need and desire. Of course, it'll take some time to learn all of your personal preferences. Well, my preference right now is to have a house that isn't radioactive.
Korea. Jamaica. Swaziland. This is just some great shit. You're gonna be selling this shit inside of 3 months.
Well, I have a $1 million cheque. How big of a bill is it? - 90 days, that's it. - It'll make people see a different side of me. You realise how important this franchise is to the studio?
Use morgan here. How did your wife like that necklace, angel? Oh, you were right.She loved it. You nailed that one. Everyone hides who they are... at lea some of the time.
It has to do with how... a retrovirus like HIV or HepB makes a home in its host genome. David, got to think these guys are up to something more than just sending wine to the President? I think I'd like to meet them. This is what's going to happen to Mexico City? If things continue as they are, it's not impossible.
It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets. But the animal... Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur. Well, normally it's only 1 ticket per passport, but, this document is so official,
She sounds healthy. She's beautiful. It's so... squishy looking. What should we name her? I want our daughter's name to be unique.
And we are thrown into that position. And again, we can use here The Birds as the final instalment and read backwards other classical Hitchcock scenes in the same way. Isn't exactly the same thing happening in what I consider the ultimate scene in Psycho, the second murder, the murder of the detective Arbogast? Hitchcock manipulates here in a very refined way the logic of so-called fetishist disavowal. The logic of, "I know very well, but..."
We've seen and heard enough. Jury, do your duty. Just watch us do our stuff We find the defendant guilty He's guilty, he's guilty Hooray!
The beloved falls out of the frame of the idealised co-ordinates, finally there exposed in his psychological nakedness. "Here I am as what I really am." And I don't think we have to read it as a happy ending. We don't know what will happen. We have the letters, "the end", the black screen, but the singing goes on.

And again, we can use here The Birds as the final instalment and read backwards other classical Hitchcock scenes in the same way. Isn't exactly the same thing happening in what I consider the ultimate scene in Psycho, the second murder, the murder of the detective Arbogast? Hitchcock manipulates here in a very refined way the logic of so-called fetishist disavowal. The logic of, "I know very well, but..." We know very well some things, but we don't really believe in them, so although we know they will happen, we are no less surprised when they happen.
So management has decided to close down. - You mean, I'm out of a job again? - I'm sorry, Peter. Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house. Okay, find the Easter egg.
Oh, man. 13 minutes after midnight, members of the wedding party entered the safe room, placing the ring into a safety deposit box, which was slid into the safe and closed for the night. No sensors indicate that either the safe door or the lock box was opened again until the following morning. Please note... he has activated the time-lock, which prevents the safe from opening. No one walks into that room again until the following morning, when the ring is discovered missing.
She's dead, Clarence, and your DNA is all over the crime scene. We have you. I didn't touch her. The pain on my face is a gift from her bodyguard. Bodyguard. Yeah. Private chaperon, same business that I'm in.
Oh, don't give me that "We are the world" crap! That woman's uterus is harboring a stolen baby. So if you know where she is, you better start talking! Or else, I'm gonna get the health department down here and take a closer look at what you're serving as mu shu pork! Boy, those people just don't have a sense of humor, do they?
Look,you want to save your little widow? We've got to find some evidence to put these guys away. I'm standing firm on this. Fine. What about the window?
Maybe passed it along as a gift. Like the green river killer ? Yeah. He'd leave jewelry for his female coworkers and then become aroused when he saw them wear it. After everything they do to these girls, why do they leave'em in these horrible positions ?
If their criminal desire wasn't present, their partnership wouldn't work. The offenders share a common delusion. It's one that you and I would never accept, but it's this bond that justifies their actions. So we're looking for two sick minds who complete each other. It's kind of like the perfect storm.
I mean, she had to know what you were doing to all those women and stayed with you anyway. Must feel great to be appreciated by the woman you love. - It does. - I bet. I know you and Amber would do anything for each other.
Well, Jacksonville P.D. searched everywhere, even swamps, and still didn't find the victims'vehicles. I got Garcia tracing VINs, but my guess is they dispose - of the cars just like they do the women. - Yeah, but the bodies are easy to find. Why do they go to so much trouble to hide the cars ?
Yes. "We must cultivate a theory about love and passion. "The heart needs training. "Our young women must know themselves. "Be conscious of their identity.
Then he made the best friend of the guilty person strike his fingertips with a ruler. Denying our identity wasn't enough. They wanted to shatter the solidarity between us. Hear the cuckoo? Yes.
You can feel its... What are they called? - Its veins. - Its veins. And the leaf isn't exactly the same on both sides.
Tree roots can't cause damage like that. I'm constantly raking up leaves and filth. It's a real headache. I understand, but a tree is alive. It's useless.
This pretty little lady is not only my daughter. She happens to be your biggest opponent in the election. Beauty and the beast. You're funny. Let the men do the work here, Dee.
Un-freaking-believable. - This is awesome, Veronica. - Thanks. And the secret parties with the booze and dudes? We're talking one greek house down, nine to go.
Oh, we'll be seeing him real soon. So... what did we learn from our little experiment this weekend? Let me hear from one of the participants? Oh, my god. That happens to me all the time.

Yes! Yes, shawn. All I'm saying is that it might be easier to try moving into a different house. One that's less... haunted. I tried that.
Yes, shawn. All I'm saying is that it might be easier to try moving into a different house. One that's less... haunted. I tried that. Whatever this thing is, it followed me all the way from san francisco.
I tried that. Whatever this thing is, it followed me all the way from san francisco. Maybe it likes you. No. I don't think so. What makes you say that?
This serum contains promicin. Everyone knows what that is. It's the neurotransmitter that gives the 4400 their abilities. It's here, now, within our grasp... This video went up the internet six hours ago.
- Oh, my. "Oh, my, " what? I'm detecting several more whales. How many more? Dozens more.
Even above the waterline? We are already being affected. Several of us are experiencing headaches, not as severe as Dr. McKay or Colonel Sheppard, but if these whales get any closer... - Turn on the shield. - Aye.
All right. Let's see. - Did you put up the shield? Yes, but it only extends so far, and the whales' signals seem to be able to penetrate it. Well, we might be able to manage it if there were only a few dozen whales, but we're talking hundreds now.
This, this is the sun, and this, this is us. A bolt of energy unlike anything you could possibly comprehend is gonna shoot out of the photosphere at a tremendous velocity. Okay? It is gonna immediately start fanning out, like so. I know.
This could have been suicide. And I sure would like to know why a rehab center has windows and balconies. So you're saying the center is responsible for Daniel's death? Why not? Yes.
D.A. Delivered new discovery. On amber wilson, I hope. Sort of.They're letters Molly wrote to amber. They're love letters. More like porn.
Maybe there's a real value to figuring out who we are alone. because we can't invest in someone really special... until we invest in ourselves. (stand...) maybe being alone isn't something to be suffered through. Maybe it's something to celebrate. stand on your own... and sometimes the universe celebres with you.
It was the sun in my eyes. Oh, my God, that is so weird. I can't believe that happened again. What? I broke a... I broke a window in the science building right over there my senior year.
Hodgins, are you still there? Hey, pretend it's me asking, OK? Look, we're just exchanging theories here at work, like always. Two substances, right? Put them in the same place at the same time.
Epps tell us the name of his accomplice? That's too easy. Well, if it's too easy, why can't we find him? You know what? He talked about impregnating Caroline. What is with Caroline Epps? Why have a child with a monster like him?
It's a known fact that you're a professional psychic... "Professional" implies that I made money at it. I don't. The panel needs to know how you became involved with the religious cult known as the seekers. I had a vision.
One of my whales refuses to leave the Montecito's Hawaiian Villas. He's been camped out for a month. Running up an extensive bill. Caviar, champagne, local strippers. The Hawaiian Villas? Yeah.
We've been looking to publish a game like this for years. Yours is actually the third one we've tried to develop. You know, this is all kind of bittersweet for me. - What is? - This ending.
This waitress knows everybody and everything. And her girlfriend is a publicity agent for a big public relations firm. She'll feed the story back to her boss in new york who loves to give gossip to real reporters in exchange for favorable stories being printed about his clients down the line. By the time the leak gets back to l.a. and it's read by our potential jurors, it's three people away from me and untraceable.
What, you don't ever get tunnel vision being on a manhunt this long? I did. Messed me up, changed me. I had to give up that game. That's the difference.
Uh, actually, Larry doesn't have a number. He doesn't have a phone. - Really? He doesn't have a cell phone? - Yeah. He calls them "electronic leashes."

Everybody, down ! I said, watch it ! Watch it ! There is nothing wrong with my software. My software is perfect, isn't it ?
You believe that the book has all the answers. To morality. Not science. But the book is inconsistent with science. You know how many epileptics were tortured because they were possessed?
You're going to be okay, buddy. Thanks for saying that. Detective. How is she? Based on her MRI, the bullet grazed the parietal lobes of her cerebrum.
Come here. Come with me. Get in the corner. Get in the corner. Garcia, you listen to me. Take this gun. I don't believe in guns.

Wow, stars. [Birds chirping, bells chiming] The stars make me dizzy. - Me too ! - Me three ! See the stars ?
- Lily. - That's the one. Man, her nut don't crack. Let's do one for 4th of July. Her nut does crack.
Are they still gonna publish your book? Anita would have wanted it that way, although I'm sure she would have preferred a version where she lived. Still, she was thrilled when my publisher bumped up the release date of "Smell of success." - When did they bump up your "smell"? - Two weeks ago.
Intelligence gathering is a game of imperfect information. We can't be sure we've made the right guess until the game is over. Oh, this game is over now, Harry. You run this thing into the ground. Stop it dead.
- I've just heard back from forensics. The sixth body, the one we took to be his, it wasn't. It was some poor vagrant shot in head and piled on to make up the numbers. Whoever's got Zaf, I think they keeping him alive. I'm gonna follow up the Magritte lead.
Why can't I go now? What about these people? What is the estimated mortality rate? Mortality is 94%. But over a limited number of infections cycles, virus goes off like a bomb, kills as many people as possible.
They need medication to alleviate their terrible suffering." Of course, everyone agrees, these people need help. Then, building on this niche, the market is broadened to include less-severe cases. A good example is cholesterol. When I first sat on the Drug Council, Quebec was spending $2.5 million on treating cholesterol.
Why? Because some seniors don't want to take medication. I can't believe my life revolves around pills and drops and whatnot. It's frustrating. I can still take the bus and go dancing. So I can take pills.

And you're so sure why? Matter of physics. I'll make it simple for you. I know they didn't cover that in your G.E.D.Course. What I did here,I filled the central cavity of the bullet half full with mercury, so when the round is fired,the mercury sets to the rear of the bullet.
You have a receipt for that at home as well? Why don't you write down all the information... about the car that you gave her? So if Lake is telling the truth, she's got a half day head start and could be, like, 400 miles away. All right. There's nothing like a nice tight APB.
The door she went to... she went with a bunch of people? No... No, there was no one there. They all went out through the billing department. So the exit she left from, where does it go?
If that's it, can I go? Yeah. If you find who killed him... give 'em a medal. Guys like Delaney make it hell for the rest of us. Your point?
- What? There's something you gotta see. I was already seeing everything I needed to see. What's going on? Remember how I recorded those kids' songs months ago?
Oh, well, that's a very nice... - Get away, get away, get away. Of course. Excuse me. Do you know where the chewable vitamins are?
At first, I thought it was because I went over my minutes. It's okay, I took that Verizon bastard with me. What's it like to die? Do you see a white light? If you're dumb enough to watch the explosion, yes.
What exactly happened to you? What happened? If you must know, I am a horrible suicide bomber. - What happened? - I had a premature detonation.
I need this ghost to cross over right now. If this guy isn't santa, how did we wind up with the letter from riley to his father? Good question. ghosts don't have mail boxes, they only have what they die with. Well, that means this ghost must have died with the letter.
He used to try and track where his father was on a map. He was so sure he was going to come home to us someday. The lie just got bigger and bigger, and I didn't know where to stop. The truth would have crushed him. Christmas... was the hardest time.
Just not enough, I guess. Here he is, alan silver. died of heart failure in '97. This guy made it big. he founded nature for life, those great organic coffees and teas. Ooh, I love that stuff.

My sister does not care for the expression "suck". We will repair to our rooms, and consume our fruit in solitude. Excuse me, Dr Harrison, sir. But the Misses Jenkyns send their compliments, and hope you are not too fatigued from your journey. And the Honourable Mrs Jamieson and Mrs Forrester have done the same.
If he lives on maimed, so will my self-respect. I am going to Manchester. Frank, I will not support you in this. Amputation will save his life and secure your reputation. You will take his arm off at the elbow.
What is the problem of ordering the same dish? As long as you like it will be fine. Do you know why I could remember your name? No. Because I remember you used to cheer me up a lot.
No matter what I do these days it's still not good enough, is it? Of the night that has yet to pass, is there any other way to go? I know the sun will shine tomorrow. When we are in the new morning, I hope that we will find the way. When the sorrows of the yesterdays come crashing on my lonely heart, the reason that I lost our love is because I neglected the needs of both our hearts.
Are you chewing gum again? Spit it out. Now. Here, spit it out. How may times have I told you not to chew gum?
Like little kids tell you what they want for Christmas? Best job I've ever had, hands down. Which is weird because that's not the way I grew up. Merry Christmas! Okay, well, what is on our list? Well, weed wackers...
They are made from snow. Every snowflake is formed from dozens of delicate ice crystals. No one has ever found two that are the same. Individual snowflakes may be fragile but put enough together and they can create one of the most awe-inspiring sights in nature. Every year, around a million avalanches thunder down the Earth's mountains.

Each dune is six kilometres from the next. Together they cover an area twice the size of Great Britain. The polar ice even creates its own climate. The air is so cold that it holds almost no moisture so, in fact, Antarctica is the biggest and driest desert on Earth. But beneath the ice is another even more magical world, one that's been lost for more than 1 0 million years.
Filmed for a year from a satellite above the North Pole, you can see how the Arctic sea ice grows and shrinks with the seasons. This changes the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth, and this in turn can influence the climate right across the planet. The effects are even greater when ice spreads beyond the poles during an ice age. Then increasingly large amounts of the Sun's energy are reflected into space. Climate and ice are intimately linked.
We're on a part of the ice sheet that's connected to the Jakobshavn Glacier. Konnie's trying to understand what's causing the ice to speed up and break off into the sea, and whether it's related to climate change. The ice moved fast, at first by 1 0%, then by 2002, 30-40% and it produced more water, like this river. And this water is probably the explanation why the ice here starts to move faster. Each summer, as a result of rising temperatures, more and more melt water is forming lakes and rivers on the surface of the ice. And this is where all the water flows, into deep shafts called moulins.
No one knows for sure where the water ends up when it disappears into the moulins, but Konnie believes it flows straight to the base of the glacier. If he's right, this could explain why the glacier is moving so fast. Water is heavier than ice so it will push itself under the ice and lift up the entire ice sheet. So this water here dives down to the bottom of the ice sheet, lifts it up, lubricates it and allows it to move really fast? If we have a water column that goes all the way down.
Now it's a lot, yeah. It's a good sign that the camera's on the right track. But if this water does reach the very bottom of the ice, there's still a long way to go. MAN: I think it's stuck. STEWART: It's stuck on a wall.
For the moment, it will have to remain a mystery. Konnie and his team will have to redesign the camera and return next summer. But wherever this water ends up, it's clear that more surface ice is melting. Scientists have mapped the area of the Greenland ice sheet that experiences surface melting in summer. As recently as 1 992, it was a relatively small area around the edges of the ice sheet. But by 2005, the melt zone had massively expanded.
This ice world is so huge that some of its greatest wonders can only be seen from space. These are megadunes of ice, carved by centuries of relentless winds. Each dune is six kilometres from the next. Together they cover an area twice the size of Great Britain. The polar ice even creates its own climate.
Yeah. Grown up stuff. You said I was a grown up already! That I wasn't in the little league anymore. This is another kind of grown up. Things change when you're this kind of grown up.
They in turn catalogued celestial groups into what we know today as constellations. This is the cross of the Zodiac, one of the oldest conceptual images in human history. It reflects the sun as it figuratively passes through the 12 major constellations over the course of a year. It also reflects the 12 months of the year, the 4 seasons, and the solstices and equinoxes. The term Zodiac relates to the fact that constellations were anthropomorphized, or personified, as figures, or animals.
Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus's existence. Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Tacitus are the first three. Each one of their entries consists of only a few sentences at best and only refer to the Christus or the Christ, which in fact is not name but a title. It means the "Anointed one". The fourth source is Josephus and this source has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years.
However, its battle against the central bank concept and the corrupt, greed-filled men associated with it, had just begun. So what is a Central Bank? A Central Bank is an institution that produces the currency of an entire nation. Based on historical precedent, two specific powers are inherent in central banking practice. The control of interest rates, and the control of the money supply, or inflation.
One of the unspoken partners of I.G. Farben was J.D. Rockefeller's Stand Oil Company in America. In fact the German Air force could not operate without a special additive patterned by Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The drastic bombing of London by Nazi Germany for example was made possible by a 20 million dollar sale of fuel to I.G. Farben by the Rockefeller standard oil company. This is just one small point about how America business funded both sides of World war 2. One other treasonous organization worth mentioning is the Union Banking Corporation of New York City.
Because less 15 percent of you read newspapers. Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube. Right now there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube. This tube is the gospel, the ultimate revelation. This tube can make or break presidents popes prime ministers.
The plane did not cut all those core columns. We designed the buildings to take the impact of the Boeing 707 hitting the building at any location. The building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners. ...that the plane flew straight into the building. Straight through, right.
"Give me control of a Nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws." M.A. Rothschild, Founder of Rothschild banking dynasty. It's important to clearly understand: the Federal Reserve is a private corporation. It is about as "Federal" as "Federal Express." It makes its own policies, and is under virtually no regulation by the US government.
Jimi Hendrix The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious shovanism, to rabid nationalistic fervor, are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism, and recognizes, that an organism at war with itself is doomed. Bill Hicks used to finish his shows with this: Life's like a ride in an amusement park, and when you go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are.
The mother holds it together. It's-It's actually difficult to, uh- oftentimes to explain to women... why Ford films are so meaningful. I don't know, uh, if he has as many female fans... as he might or should. Uh, we know his treatment of women in his films is often prehistoric. So as long as the mother was there with her apron strings, you know... in the kitchen serving this family's brood of boys, um, she was doing her job.
So, of course, now it's John Ford saying I wonder how this is going to work out. Because John Ford, of course, generally had his way. Darryl F. Zanuck... born and reared in Wahoo, Nebraska, was, um... American-born, American-bred... and at his studio he loved the theme of Americana. With the United States coming out of the Great Depression... studios, primarily Fox... went back into episodes of American history... to shore up a recovering America... in a sense of itself, where it had been and what the promise could be. And this episode of Dr. Mudd and John Wilkes Booth is a fascinating one.
Because in reality, the fact that Zanuck did this... and wanted a graveside speech given by Henry Fonda to his slain brother... which surprisingly Ford didn't do. Didn't echo Young Mr. Lincoln or Judge Priest. Zanuck put that in, and he trimmed some other scenes... which were, uh, I think, justifiably a little too long. They needed the trimming. So the Zanuck cut, I believe, was actually a good Ford cut. And it showed that Zanuck honored and appreciated his best director.
- What I figure it is... I think the thing is right in the bedroom. This thing wants to communicate. So, I figure I'm gonna go out and get a Ouija board... No! I don't want to know what this thing has to say.
OK, I want to give you the name of Dr. Johann Averies. He's a colleague. He's a demonologist, he specializes in this sort of thing. - He's in Los Angeles. - OK. All right, check this out. What if we just get this Ouija board, right?
He's a colleague. He's a demonologist, he specializes in this sort of thing. - He's in Los Angeles. - OK. All right, check this out. What if we just get this Ouija board, right? We find out what it wants, then we give it what it wants and then... gone.
I think I found something pretty cool, and I'd like you to help me figure it out. So, sit down. No? Or stand up. I caught on camera everything that happened after we left. - When the cursor was moving by itself.
And the whole payment system was built around: Do I give you this unit of information? or don't I give it to you? And that was how the whole model of copyright was built from the book on up. What used to be property - music, cinema - now becomes very, very easy to transmit across barriers. We have today the ability to make copies and distribute copies inexpensively.
And this young Oliver Twist, if he were to be found, would he be sharing those expectations with you? Oh, to have your inheritance halved by a workhouse bastard. That must cut like a knife. This letter's far from worthless, Sir. Give it to me.

The source is His gift to us. Through it, one of us may be reborn into something more. More than immortal? Perhaps. Perhaps the sanctimonous bullshit Giovanni. You don't know where the source is. No one does.
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff. I think it does prove that he's here in Haddonfield. It was a Halloween prank. Kids pull shit like that all the time. The stone will be returned tomorrow.
You are not a fucking baby! You hid it. You hid it in the cupboard. At the very back of the cupboard, with Nini's silver. - I did no such thing.
Her name was Velvet. Nobody forgets Velvet You look kind of skinny. I feel skinny. It's allright.
A few days after three black prisoners are murdered the DA announces they're not gonna press charges. Hi, Betty. An hour later, a guard is strangled, thrown off the tier. The authorities go straight to George. They say no one else could have done it.
Hey, I'd like to see the minutes from the grand jury testimony if I could. Absolutely, right this way. Why, I heard a strangled yell and looked toward the corridor and I seen the officer being assaulted. He was being held down by one cat and he was being attacked by the other two. After Jackson had him in a headlock Drumgo and Clutchette were stabbing him.

You got a plan B? Trust me. Meet me in the john in two minutes. Welcome to Feng's bathroom. Hey. May I interest you in an Altoid or some Axe Body Spray?
Is this your car? Can you turn that thing off? It'll go off in a couple of minutes. - Can you turn that off? - No, I can't, sir. What about that controller, beeper?
Sometimes the world tries to knock it out of you. But I believe in music the way that some people believe in fairy tales. I like to imagine that what I hear came from my mother and father. Maybe the notes I hear are the same ones they heard the night they met. Maybe that's how they found each other.
Well, it's kind of an ending. But it deserved to go out with a bang. What ended? Negro Day. What? All right. velma von Tussle just told me we have had our last show.
- It doesn't even rhyme. - What's your problem? - It's pretentious. Nick's always trying to make himself important. I think Powell has serious issues.
If you want to post a letter, you do it through me! One letter every six months, no longer than 500 words. No reference to other prisoners, no mention of prison conditions. And no bloody politics. If you fail to adhere to these regulations, your letters will not be posted.
Look. - For Christ's sake, mind you don't fall. - This one's really pretty, don't you think? - I once had two daughters. Both called Cornelia. But they died.
Uh, Marieke, carry this for your sister. Be her champion. Hmm? Now, Carl, kiss Hendrickje. Hmm? And then for your sake, as well as for ours, you must leave. This painting is dedicated to your father. Mm?
If you don't like it, you take my shift next time. For psych tests on deep space, I ran sensory-deprivation trials. Testing total darkness on flotation tanks. And the point about darkness is, you float in it. You and the darkness are distinct from each other because darkness is an absence of something, it's a vacuum.
But we're not gonna do that. Just to make it absolutely clear, there's no way we're gonna do that. Do I have to spell it out for you? We have a payload to deliver to the heart of our nearest star. We're doing it because that star is dying.

The old lady's beat to shit, the husband's mean, cracked out, tries to give us trouble, Nicky lays him down. We're doing an inventory, but it looks like we messed up because there's no dope in the house, and I go in the back room... Now, this place was a shithole, mind you. Rats, roaches all over the place. But the kid's room, in the back, was spotless.
- So you were successful? - Yes. The fourth general. I want to ask you before I go if I could take one last look? I believe this is the one they call General Akeela? It's actually "Aguila," but that was a good try.
Look, I saw the tape, okay? He was drunk, high. He just fucking lost it. He lost it then, and he's losing it now. There was these two girls, right? Named Marda and Una.
He lost it then, and he's losing it now. There was these two girls, right? Named Marda and Una. They said they were cousins but... We used to hang out together from time to time.
John Major and the British backed the Fox, even though they would never publicly admit it. Yeah, they brokered the peace agreement, but some would suggest they made a secret deal with the Fox that if he stepped down from power, they would not arrest him for war crimes. Who knows what's true, what isn't? The whole fucking thing is dirty. But in dirty times... dirty deeds need to be done, right?
Do we know who she was going with? Still working on it. Other than that, no serious debt, no weird activity. What about the plymouth county victim? We find any connection between them?
Look... don't worry about it. Twelve-year-old girls blow their boyfriends... before having even kissed them. I'm not talking about the fucked-up ones. Good girls from good families. They think it's normal. Know why?

You cannot see them, but it's as if you are in one room and they're in the next. - I should have died too. - Not your destiny. I have no destiny. Every living creature has a destiny, be sure of it.
Are you all right? Guys. I never thought I'd see you again, you know that? Let's get something to eat. We've not established the protocol for minors. We have issues of disease and sanitation. We don't fully understand the virus yet.
Pilar... How many similar cases have you had in this damned village? Get another distraction, I didn't invite you here. What should I do? My dear, you are a good mother.
"So?" Yeah, like, "So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter." "So, you seem to always know what's best." "So, I guess I'm invisible." Now I've moved out, we're dividing furniture... Women.
Now that's gross. You are twisted, you know that? No, I'm not twisted. I'm honest, okay? I mean, most girls would have lied.
You are twisted, you know that? No, I'm not twisted. I'm honest, okay? I mean, most girls would have lied. If you had asked them what they did for a living, they would have lied.
And these pampered post-war pinheads thought that they could just breeze through life, doing whatever the hell they wanted. For instance... When the men would normally go to war, you know, all this male aggression serves a purpose. It keeps the herd strong. But these guys said "I don't like this particular war." "I think I'll stay home."
Because she didn't show her work correctly. But she got it right. The standardized tests require her to get to the answer a certain way. But her mind works a different way. Well, my job is to get the students to do well on the standardized tests.
We're going to dig water wells here, and water wells means irrigation. Irrigation means cultivation. We're going to raise crops here where before it just simply wasn't possible. You're going to have more grain than you'll know what to do with, and bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am. New roads, agriculture, employment, education.
I don't belong to one church in particular. I like them all. I like everything. Where are you from? That would be telling you. That's what I want to sell you. What are you doing in Signal Hill?
I'm sorry, Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecs. No, I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face. I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves.
You've had a long flight. You're under a lot of stress. You're under arrest. I ain't under arrest. - Do you drink? - Oh, God, yeah.
That monster Nessie still here? 'Aye, she's still here. Well, who don't you tell Nessie that this Harry Houdini's gonna tie a knot in her tail and fling her into the Scottish Ocean? ! What about $10,000, Mr. Houdini? Are you psychic, Hamish?
- Mr. Houdini? - Mr. Houdini! Mr. Houdini! What do you hope to prove by this experiment? Well, well, the 'psychic reporter'.

- Yes. - My father thinks she's an abomination. Does he? He's not different from the rest of the men around here. And I don't see other women in the wagon train wearing pants or carrying guns.
Hot cider? Not only are you a murderer of love, but you're the worst parent ever. Sweet. Well, um, as you probably know, we have met with two other candidates, but my father and I are confident that we have saved the best for last. Uh, girls. You can leave if you like. Oh.

Don't ever say anything like that. What? You can do anything. If you set your mind to it, you can do anything! The Human mind... The Human mind is an incredible thing.
-lt might make you mad again. No. Go. There is no point in you coming here every week if we eventually don't discuss your life and discuss your family. Is this session over yet?

Why would we cancel the meeting? It's great for them because... (Shulie) This is fucking bullshit. Peter, could you take over please for a minute? I'll be right back. It's fucking bullshit!
It's great for them because... (Shulie) This is fucking bullshit. Peter, could you take over please for a minute? I'll be right back. It's fucking bullshit! Sadie, I don't know why your friends are here when I'm trying to have a meeting or why they can't behave like adults, but I still have ten pages of a budget that I have to get approved.
I don't know. Why not a giant vagina? I'd go visit that. I bet you would. Well, what about the Vietnam Memorial?
- Doesn't matter if we win. - As long as the casino loses, yes. That could actually work. So you need to rig... Craps, blackjack, roulette, slots. Now this polymer reacts to ultrasonic pulses.

Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss" or "Dance With Me Tonight"? This is embarrassing. They don't want it. No, it's not. These songs, they're fantastic.
I'm feeling generous, so I offer him one of my girls, and you should have seen his eyes light up and said he needed girls. Some show he was planning. I have... had... a stable of girls I offer him for the week. We shake on it, and the next thing I know, my dumb ass is dosed. And the next thing I know, my girls are gone.
See what you can do. Uh, all right, big guy wants us all to concentrate on EuroTech. And nobody talks to them except me and Richard. You got it. All right.
No, no, no, no. I don't think so, no. Not like this. Because I've heard differently. Yeah? Because of the French mothers. What, uh-what about the French mothers?
No. - Everybody has got that. Like a dream. Dream! - No!
Oh, beast. She misses you. You giving her her medication? Yeah. Did you water my plant?
The one from Urban Outfitters. You saw it! Jesus, Jon! - Excuse me. - Hold on a second. Yeah.
Sit down. What's wrong? I need you to go down to family court with me right away so you can tell them that you're taking the girls. I need you to raise them. Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids, but I can't take them full time.
- Yep. I was thinking maybe we'll stop and pick up some groceries and a cooler. I don't know your financial situation, but... No, no, that's good. That's great. Okay.
Your article-- it's called "Women Who Led." I hope you're inspired. I hope you can inspire others. You can contact me. My details are on the back. Quinn: "l never intended this to happen, but the burden of Hobbs' money sent me in a different direction. I discovered the world and through it, I discovered myself.
Then... Berlin is still standing? In its old glory? As I've been told? You may have bombed us, but you'll never hit us!
That way you can feel deep down... Yes, but I never close my eyes. Out of principle. Not even when I sleep. I don't quite understand.

Come and eat with me. I fear I am not an amusing guest. I invited our Carmelites' confessor. Well then... lt's a contemplative order. Our saint, Theresa of Avila, set its rule in her book the "lnterior castle".
And besides, what is your grievance? My heart was not enough, you brutally demanded my person. Brutally? You came to me as one would to a bad woman, with no respect... and none of the attentions of love. If I did wrong, may I not be forgiven?

You know, I wouldn't even mind this stuff, if it wasn't for all the airbrushing. See how smooth her skin is? She probably has cottage-cheese thighs. They just paint over it. And now men look at these pictures and think that's how women should look.
You've made copies of my paychecks? How'd you get these? - My salary's not your business. - Of course it is! - We have a child and she costs money. - Did you give her the key to my desk?
Now look what you did! Snowball! Come here, Snowball. Come on. God-fucking-damn it. First, your idiot of a president declares a ceasefire even though Saddam isn't dead yet, or even captured. And then, I ran over a cat, about a block away.
Jessica? Yes, Daddy. Now, who wants to get the fireworks? I'll get them. Just don't screw it up.
I heard he might run for mayor, and to tell you the truth, I'd vote for him. He's a hell of a guy. Um... Hey, um, did anyone mention to you about the new mentor program that we're doing here? No.

There aren't many people in Marmorera who could know her. What about the young lady's dress? Could it be examined closely? The young lady's dress? You'd better ask at Savognin Hospital.
The lady tried that this afternoon. - Count faster, Beavis. I mean, how primitive do you think we are? It's not a bet if there's nothing at stake, right, captain? I mean, even you need a chance.
Here we go again. ...a deliberate exploitation of memory and the senses. They brought the elements of strangeness into areas... You're not too familiar with the female anatomy. To Baudelaire, beauty was ugly, unpredictable, even frightening.
Never. Good people never hold grudges. You have to be a good man, hard-working. Enrique, never let them erase the memory of your parents. Make sure you take yourfirst Communion properly.
Okay, that's all I need. What if it only goes a half hour? There's a chance that someone... The show can't. It won't. And even if it does, we will have the most unbelievable clip.
Looks like you get stuck with the check. We live in a country that's considered to be the ultimate model of government. By the people, for the people, and of the people. But most Americans would be surprised to find how afraid the Founding Fathers were of what a direct democracy could do to the country. Can anyone tell me why? The young man snoring there, perhaps?
Watch any corner of foaming water find me the most accursed of all whales! Moby Dick. Yes, Moby Dick! The same one that dismasted me! To whom I owe this stump on which I rely.
What is that thing? He beats me. -Son of a bitch. I'll bump. They laugh.
My dear inspector, This time, that's it. Here I am." VIP Section individual cell For all the sex offenders, the "nonces", as they are known here. Sir, .. ... I do not know whether you will read this letter.
No, you hadn't... Yes, you had gotten to the dummy. 'Cause you're saying I'm his partner. It's like when we went shopping, you tell me: "get 5 boxes" Then: "Why didn't you get 5 different boxes?"
The detainees at Guantanamo are being treated humanely. I love you. I love you. Don't you collapse now. Everybody else can collapse but not you. Don't you collapse.
Shady-looking fellows. Suspicious gents... Excuse me, I would really like to know... What are you gentlemen doing in my yard, by my house? You call this a house? It's a shack.
Rule number 1, poker's all about deception. - Hello. - Hey! She left. Stacey did?
Stay here with me, okay? We'll take the ferry tomorrow. Promise nothing else will happen. I promise. Well, the starter motor's perfect now.
Promise nothing else will happen. I promise. Well, the starter motor's perfect now. The car's old, but it's still strong. I can't do anything about the door. - No spare parts.
You gonna drink that whole bottle of cough medicine? That's a dumb way to get loaded. Let's look at the itinerary. Fuck the itinerary. You know, I think I'm gonna have to get that belt back after all.
You understand? Jimmy Whitman? Yeah. What happened to him? He got hit by a taxi.
Down and out himself. Couldn't sell anything. Was he ahead of his time? Did he just lack talent? I couldn't tell. To be frank, I found his canvases horrible. Anyway, the man gave me two coins.
Cinema is distasteful. But a great actress is a great actress, even in a bad play. And I am the greatest. Absolutely! That's why I want you in my picture! I accept.
Absolutely! That's why I want you in my picture! I accept. If the future generations will miss my Phèdre, they'll have at least that: My moving shadow.
Like he isn't standing right behind me? Well, once we're clear of the 23rd. Just four more days. When do I get to find out why you brought me here? Well, there hasn't been a lot of rain but it's enough.
Yeah, but that was just a one-off, wasn't it? Exactly, a one-off, an aberration. We've all taken a wrong turn and ended up somewhere weird. Like a vagina. Otto, I am not gay.
And I never knew what to do with the typography on my designs. We would make book covers and record covers as school projects, and I'd go to the local art store, I'd go to Sam Flax, and I'd buy Helvetica as press type, and I'd rub it down in the corner of the album the way I thought it was supposed to be, kind of flush left. And of course it would never line up properly and thing would crackle and break and it'd be terrible. And Zagorski told me to let go of the press type, and illustrate the type. And it hadn't dawned on me that typography could have personality the way drawing did.
But my father said, lf ever I have an idea of a new typeface, I'm sure that you could design it. I have here a type specimen book of both type foundries, Stempel and Haas. You have to know that Haas was controlled by the German type foundry Stempel. And in turn Stempel was also controlled by Linotype. Now we go down to the cellar and see in our archives where we can find Helvetica.
I can't explain it I just love, I just like looking at type, I just get a total kick out of it. They are my friends. Other people look at bottles of wine or whatever, or girls' bottoms, I get kicks out of looking at type. It's a little worrying I must admit, it's a very nerdish thing to do. I'm very much a word person. So that's why typography for me is the obvious extension. It just makes my words visible.
It's very hard to do the more subjective, interpretive stuff well. You know, I can teach anybody off the street how to design a reasonable business card or newsletter. But if I bring the same group off the street and play a CD and say, "Okay, now let's interpret that music for a cover, well 9 out of 1 0 are going to be lost and are going to do something corny and expected, and one person is going to do something amazing because that music spoke to them and it sent them in some direction that nobody else could go. And that's the area to me where it gets more interesting and exciting, and more emotional. And that's where the best work comes from.
Like we'd throw you anything less? - Nice. - Later, guys. Later. Oh, here comes some chicks.
I can treat. Of course, then you'd have to invite me to the dinner. She knows I'm broke. She knew before she met with my father. Daniel, I don't think it's really a good idea to let Wilhelmina pay for dinner.
-How are you? -Oh, the whole family is abuzz. Everyone's pointing fingers. Brother Albert says his poisoning is a conspiracy involving your husband's brother. That's ridiculous.
I'll go and shower. Do you want something to eat? - Not now. Look at the flowers. I've already seen them.
-Yo, Baiano! -How's life, my friend? Baiano was the one in charge of the NGO's slum. -What's up, Lombada? Any news?
If your father is meant to be sacrificed, that is how it will be. Now tell me what the FBI said. Good. You did the right thing. Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package?
Match between my team and your team. I mean, between mens team and womens team? Yes. Your team and my team. If they lose, they lose...
Don't think that the match is against 1 men. You must sbow the entire nation that women can perform better than man. How good are the men also, that they don't do work. They can'teven make simple decision. Your match is against tbose fools...
Earl, give him $500. Look, I don't know if it matters to you, but the kid with Jimmy, I don't think he was a Donnelly. Seemed more like a crackhead to me. And Jimmy called the kid Whitey. Now, for some people, losing' a dream can make you dangerous.
I'm sure we've met, haven't we? Or in another life perhaps. No, this one, but it was a long time ago. It's your lovely accent. We were wondering if you could translate something for us.
Please, sit. Thank you. Are you here because of Platt and co? Why? For a time, those young men were very close.
I'm not a nice guy. - We're closing I am a big shit. A modern hero. I find my trousers in Vogue Italy and in Deutsh and VanityFair prior to the month of purchase.
He also just learned English. So, no one leaves a waterless hole from now on. - Ananias. - What? We lost over half our men last night. We can't possibly expect to fight these things again... like that and survive.
No head, no confirmation that Andre G is really dead or that the head is actually his. I mean the cops are gonna be all over your boy Don. This story is solid. I ran this whole thing by legal so unless you brought muffins, I'd think that we're done here.
I was just hoping I could show you something. Well, should we go to the bathroom for this? What do you want? It's... my grandpa's key. He just passed and left it to me in his will.
It's got nothing to do with you. Yes, it does. I don't understand how you all can like each other so much. Me and my sister-wives.... Always held themselves apart.
Here we go. That's the one. That is good. "Maximum strength. Night-time use only."
I prayed because I was so angry. This man was destroying my family. So you read that scroll and called up a golem to kill Keith Harrow? I did. And you believe your prayers were answered.
No? Well, we wanted to meet you face to face first. - Mm-hmm. - Then we saw on your website... That you really like to kind of foster... Okay. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. We can get to the paperwork in a second, okay?
- Mm-hmm. - Then we saw on your website... That you really like to kind of foster... Okay. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. We can get to the paperwork in a second, okay? Now, I listened to the demo again, and it sounds great. It does. It sounds great.
Can I sit down? Sure. So how'd the rest of your day go? It get any better? That's why I'm here.
- Make the door open! Shawn! Where are you going? My partner and i just need to confer in private. Compare notes and whatnot. Okay... the girls are sleeping over at the omega mus'.
Alice,you do not want to do this. Give me the ax. I'm not who you think I am. No,you are exactly who I think you are. You're the reason girls vomit and starve themselves to death.
This is so... scary. I was lying in bed watching one tree hill, my favourite show- chad michael murray is so hot- and I have this cute liquid kitty alarm clock,right? It meows,and it blinks its eyes every half-hour. So... all of a sudden,they just started blinking, over and over and over, and then it just stopped! And then... it let out this half-meow... mraah! And then its tail fell off.
Wait a second. Doreen wasn't supposed to die. This was an accident. The wood. the wood was rotten. The latch broke.

Shit! No-one here. Come on, quick. It works! 'Your battery is running low'.
Can I help you with something? Hello again. Hello. Is there something I can help you with? I was just looking at this chair.
Dr. Turnbull will see you now. Oh great. Come on, Bob. We've been studying ways to repair optic nerve damage for several years now. What we're doing is we're injecting a solution containing self-assembling peptides into the damaged area.
That sword is my destiny. A samurai's weapon must be used with honor. And respect. This sword has many lessons to teach. Swords are for killing.
- Just go. - You know... It's okay. It's okay. It makes sense, facing the kind of sentence that you're facing, that you want to give up.
You said you needed to be selfish about your music. I could sign tomorrow. It would be... it would be enough, you know? What kind of pussy-ass 18-year-old settles for enough? I want my life, I want my music...
What does that have to do with us? Nothing, really, except... Gloria's wearing my mom's earrings. Why was she wearing your mom's earrings? Hey, Gloria, how're you doing?
Inside is an extremely deadly variant of Russian influenza. I will take it to a crop-duster at Denham airfield, which I will fly over a 35 square mile area, releasing the virus onto those below. I will repeat this at four other as of yet undisclosed locations all over the world. Does it bother you that we're going to release a deadly virus? Well, we have a vaccine.
Janine didn't miss it. I did. I slept in. I didn't call her till too late. It's not her, it's me. Those bales on the east field got rained on last night.
It's precisely why I've been studying him. Could his condition become dangerous to himself or to other people? If he absorbs too much, or comes into contact with an unstable ability, then most definitely yes. Can you fix it? Alter his genes somehow?
Thanks anyway. So have you seen my lunchbox or not? I don't know. - It's wherever you left it. - I left it in the car.
Thank you. Thank you for being honest with me. So what? What if it is true? What are you gonna do about it? There is nothing you can do about it.
Wipe your arse with it. I really don't care. Well, well. Lucius Vorenus. You found my gold yet?
His mortal flesh is in the throne room meeting the delegation from the Senate. - They're here already? - Yes. Senator Bibulus and several other distinguished men whose names I forget arrived this morning. And why are you not in there?
I'll be going then. Should I give him your love? What should I tell him? Tell him that he's still got all our money and we want it back. All right, the blue.
Talkin' about toxic. You are so beautiful. Shut up. I just like you. Thank you.
We knew that the radioactive clouds would spread over every continent. We knew the planet would be uninhabitable for many years. And so you built this place? That we could rebuild without fear of the Wraith ever returning. So, you see, these souls must survive.
Sheppard, Ronon, come in! Still here, barely. I was pretty sure you were dead! Yeah, well, same here. According to the readings in here, your compartment was almost completely vented.
Well, this is a nice surprise! What's he doing here? We're taking this walking stick! It belonged to Imholz, didn't it? I really want this stick.
If we go ahead with this... it'll clamp down on the collateralizing of property. That could lead to a lot of defaults on loans. And if those start to mount... You worried about the banks? They can handle it.
- Who else has seen this report? No one. It was on top of Rednazki's inbox, still sealed. You stole it? Borrowed it.
I don't know. Is that his? It's hard to tell. It's not like we went to Tiffany's, you know? A lot of people could have that ring.
The problem with the double bubble, is you gotta chase down every jackass on the street trying to hone in on you! The other problem is, I'm one of them! Are you guys having fun? My man Dokey! Yeah, I got that package for you.
It's just a fancy word for fuse. Someone had to be on the other end of that tube to flip a switch. And whoever it was needed to have a clear line of sight so they knew when to trigger it. Exactly. Look, we follow that tube to a nearby manhole cover, maybe we'll find the initiator.
you were perfect-- two guys who had every reason to hate the government for what happened to your fathers. -and you set us up. -you don't know it, but I saved your lives at the drexler. did you get out? the bomb had a fail-safe.
Now I know the reality... it's a curse. Why? I can see the whole of history, but I don't belong anywhere within it. So, your return to this time had a price. Time's splintering. This city exists on a rift in time.
What's the matter? Go ahead. This is stupid. Without a new carburettor, it's not gonna work. Having hope is never stupid.
I promised they would be clothed and fed... and could go home within 3 years It's been 5 years now... We attack at dawn Lian I like to study different faces... but I haven't seen a new face... since Suzhou came under siege a year ago
General Zhao, take your time to think it over General He You must be wondering... how long it takes to get from the gates to here? I had the same thought the first time... I stood outside the palace gates
That's an out-of-body experience? Or an O.B.E., as we pretentious experts like to say. An energy body or an astral body carries the consciousness from the physical body. And the energy would have to stay close to the physical body, wouldn't it? Well, that depends on how advanced the energy is.
Honey, I still don't get it. I mean, the ghost was killed by an undertaker? They thought he or she was dead, but he wasn't? They died in some kind of surgery? The ghost was obviously feeling helpless.
Well,thank you. I appreciate the support. It's good to see you. Weren't you impressed? Well, you were talking to a room full of republican women.
I know you will. I see it. I see the light. You've seen it before. Not as beautiful.
I don't think doctors should make promises they can't keep. Laura Grey-Thompson, born four days ago with jejunal atresia, corrected surgically. Post-op course... Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
It's too late. You're gonna end up looking into my cases,catherine. they're clean. I promise,every one of them. Except the alvarez homicide in philly.
Big whoop. I was in Hotlanta. That whole town is whack. Yeah, that sounds amazing, but you know what? The lady, Jan Levinson, wanted to go to Montego Bay. You took the Ice Queen?
Really? I have a special assignment for you. Who's the target? A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture... the file name is "Jamaica Jan Sun Princess."
What? I think I should go with you. Take care of Ma. And lock the door, Kevin. All right, I'm gonna shoot that guy. When I do, I want you to run to the dock and throw the grenade.
Susan made a deal... I'll hire the best lawyer in town on one condition... You can't see him anymore. And a missing wife returned. Hello, Alma.
- No. - Yes. Those people you passed? They're your competition. Am I supposed to believe any of this? I admit without the PowerPoint, it does seem a little farfetched, but if it is true and you refuse to compete, you'll never know what else might be waiting for you at the finish line.
But the end of gasoline meant the end of electricity, nuclear power. There's coal, but you still need trucks to deliver the fuel. No electricity means no refrigerators, and that means spoiled food. In days, grocery stores were picked clean. Within weeks, there was looting, rioting, and chaos.
How are the dogs ? Tender Listen, I have a friendly advice... Keep your eyes on the price. What?
When I go in and say "Ho, it's so good to be home!", that's the cue for you guys to rush in and descend the guards. Any questions? Are the guards mentally ill? What? How are they supposed to believe that you are mick jagger in that ridiculous mask? This mask is only supposed to get me pass the security cameras
I know who I am ! I'm not sure you do. Your name is Clark Kent, not Kal-El. And Jor-El isn't your father. Dr. fine, Dr. Milton fine, please report to level three, stat.
i do, i want him to fuck me. i don't really have a shot with him, i think, because- ha ha ha ha! i just don't rape movie stars, i'm not really- i'm fucking fat. it's ridic-like, i even wear- like, i have this problem now, my pants keep- like, i can't keep them- they won't stay up, because-here's what happens. ok, you get fat, and some of you skinny people- won't-i don't give a shit about you, won't get this.
i'm relieved. now when i see a beautiful girl walking down the street, i'm like, "hey, fuck you, i don't give a shit." - ew. go fuck somebody else, i'll jerk off to you later, probably have a better time. - not like she would've fucked the shit out of me anyway, you know, like she would've given me her best. i never really got the best out of a beautiful woman.
- my wife and i are sitting on the couch, just sitting there, just fucking married on the couch, you know? just-and my wife looked at me, and i don't know where she got this sort of sense that i was- she said something like, and i was like, "oh, who gives a shit?" like, i don't know what it was that tipped her off that i was starting to feel real bad- here's the thing- is that as far as sex, for guys it's just not comp- we just need to release, that's all it is, we just-we just need it.
just-and my wife looked at me, and i don't know where she got this sort of sense that i was- she said something like, and i was like, "oh, who gives a shit?" like, i don't know what it was that tipped her off that i was starting to feel real bad- here's the thing- is that as far as sex, for guys it's just not comp- we just need to release, that's all it is, we just-we just need it. women, it's like a fucking emotional thing, where they need-we need to come just 'cause we need to, women, it's like they get into it.
um, unless you have a reason, like you want to fuck somebody and they won't let you, in which case, uh... - what other option do you have? how else are you supposed to have an orgasm in their body if you don't rape them? that's fucked up. so, here's a weird thing that happened to me.
No, I'm good. - Maybe a glass of water. - Great. I just don't see how they fit in the voting boxes. Come on, these women sacrificed their life so you can vote.
Denny, I think you're absolutely right. Of course I'm right. Let's go get the hookers. This isn't a complicated case. The defendant lethally injected five people, causing their deaths.
Maybe. So what? That doesn't give this doctor the right to take the law, and more importantly, their lives into her hands. Physician-assisted suicide isn't even lawful in this state. To kill a patient without his consent, do I really need to stand here and argue the illegality of that?
To be continued. * Saw the people standin'... * thoreawrote, "if you built castles in the air, "your work need not be lost. "That is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them."
Yeah. I was sitting right there when I painted that, just a few weeks after I finished building this place. You built this cabin? With my own two hands. Wow.
I have to recalculate the profile for two of the target cities. I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary. You think the authorities know we're working with Fayed? If they don't, they will soon. I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash.
I'm sorry. I can't do it. - Sandra, please. - I've already lost one brother. I can't lose another one.
I'd be happy to have Logan's car crushed. - What's he drive? - Not his. A little Mercedes at this address. You can't miss it, the plates read, "GOTZMINE."
How'd you find out? I found out from Tim. So, what'd he wanna know? You know, what I heard. What I saw and what time it was. And what'd you tell him?
- You are needed in Metropolis. It is a matter of terrific urgency. I have isolated a match via interstellar records... from your father's archives. The subject in question was biologically engineered... to be the ultimate soldier. Precise, clinical, unstoppable.
See you. Well, now you know. You did some time. I bought some coins in Turkey. Beautiful pieces. 11th century.

- Will there be a lawsuit? - Julia! Do you have a message for other rape victims? McPherson, my office. I need to know who the hell leaked that videotape.
Of course. They both have weak immune systems. What's going on, guys? Sinatra is one of those diseases where technically it's not the disease that kills you: it's the immune system's response to it. Your body is trying so hard to kill the germs, it literally kills itself.
And those babies went to couples who could afford to raise them right. You mean couples who could afford to cut in line. I never harmed any of those girls. Isolation room,selling their kids. You got a funny way of defining "harm."
It was Bill's idea to keep quiet about St. Mary's. And you just went along with it? He was my husband. I didn't have a choice. Till the day he died,we never discussed it again.
Thank you. I can't believe I got through. Listen, I just got back from Los Angeles and the smog was terrible. I was wondering if anyone there has any thoughts on the subject. Max, I'll take this one. I know what he means.
Questions so far? You sure it's not Hairrow? It's a ten-hour drive to the Canadian border. We're going to have to go without a surveillan van. I've got it covered.
- Yeah. You know about this promo? I took care of it. She did the dolphin voice. Yeah, I asked Promo to stop running it.
The president travels on the 18th. - By sundown on the 19th, we will control the country. - Casualties? - None. - Mm-hmm. - And this? - At the hour of the coup... we will take over all radio and television stations.
Yeah. Are you sure you're okay? What? Why this sudden concern with my health? I don't know.
Yeah, it's gone anywhere from three-and-a-half weeks to as short as six days. Guess I should treasure every moment. Well, we have to get this thing out of you before it does too much damage. Your body's in good shape, so... Thanks for noticing.
If you do get into trouble I want you to say, "my mother is not going to like this," and I will come right in. I know what I'm doing. All right, don't accept any drinks from anyone, and don't leave your drink unattended. If anyone gives you drugs, take them, but do not take them. Do you understand?
Thank you, uncle earl. He told you to buy her some earrings? Not in so many words, ma. Man can't speak, remember? I took some initiative.
With Orlean Abbot's arrest, Roman's shooting, we-- We don't know what the future holds. We need this company. We need it now. I don't have faith that this is for us. I think the company is corrupt.
Yes, it is. And you... You lure rich suckers into the casino to lose millions of dollars. So, you continue to do that. And now if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. This conversation is not over.
I mean, I know Julie and some of the othersare bad, but... What happened? I was at this prenatal yoga class and these young women, they're monsters. They wanted me to join the six-pack pack. The what?
Mister! Mail carrier, sir. Excuse me, please. Um, could you wait? Hi.I'm sorry. Um, a woman in that house where I live just gave you a letter that she shouldn't have,and, uh, I kind of need it back.
This is a big operation. Yeah, well, you should see this place when it's up and running. Loud as an A-bomb and just about as safe. Listen, we really need this downtime. I mean, look around.
Lieutenant Caine, I'm in the middle of rounds, so I only Did you find my baseball? As a matter of fact, we did. Along the way, we stumbled onto this. Do you recognize that bracelet?
But he brought me a lovely bouquet of flowers in apology. - They're right... - Uh-huh. Kelly, where are the flowers? They were just there. I just put 'em right there.
You don't have to say anything at all. Now or ever. What's a windmill park? Looks like Dad owns a couple of windmills in Palm Springs. - We own windmills?
The odds were against  <hon>him<hoff>. Opening a successful restaurant in Manhattan is like catching a firefly in your hand, only a hell of a lot more expensive. Well, all I can tell you is this amuse-bouche is great. Yes, my mouth is very amused. That's funny.
You ever see the movie Moscow on the Hudson ? Since replacing a passport and credit cards takes a while, Pierre had no choice but to be my guest in America. So I got him a motel room right next door to mine. So I am guessing there is no 24-hour concierge ?
Goodbye? - Goodbye. It does not exclude other continents. No, not at all. I would not surrender India in order to find a woman.
Don't even try. You're literally wasting your breath. I've injected 3ccs of tribusonol into your larynx. Do you have any idea what I do here every day? How many lives these hands have saved?
This is Adrian Monk. He's a special consultant. What happened to your nose? / Uh... - You get shot? - Shot? No. No.
I've been working there for ten years, and they never bothered me! If I were you, I would not be such an environmentalist! I boiled some water! Would you like Bancha tea? "Bancha"?
Listen, I confessed because I wasn't able to tell the difference between my own thoughts and my visions. I saw her get killed, but I wasn't there. It wasn't me. I know that now. How can you be so sure?
I saw her get killed, but I wasn't there. It wasn't me. I know that now. How can you be so sure? The voice in my head, it stopped when I went to jail.
Mrs. Cutler, your daughter didn't die from an overdose. Now don't you want to know the truth, because I know I would. You've got ten minutes. Thank you. It all started when your daughter and her friends went to a party hosted by a woman named Bianca.
Get back here. You know, this is nice. Just two friends having dinner. Hanging out. No pressure. Nothing weird. My stereo does that all the time.
Tyrone. He's known her since she was still Enid Wyman. I bet she's a full-blown witch. I mean, everyone that Henry is involved in, they just love the black magic. I do not love the black magic.

We got nothing on the home phone, a few strange hits on the work line, but when we ran the cell phone, we hit the jackpot. We found a number that he calls only from his cell phone, all hours of the night, way too often for business... Unless it's monkey business. - Sweet! - So we contacted the cell company for the name. The number is 555-01... 9...
We found a number that he calls only from his cell phone, all hours of the night, way too often for business... Unless it's monkey business. - Sweet! - So we contacted the cell company for the name. The number is 555-01... 9... well, where is it?
Stop it, sam. You're only making this harder. * all i wanna do is be true to my ways * And when you hide what you feel, you end up with regrets. I love you, too. * all i wanna do is be true to my ways * Being honest might not make you the most popular girl in the school yard, But it will earn you respect.
Take me to bed or lose me forever. Really? All right. It's been a while. I'll try not to touch you too much.
Carl, eat an orange! Eat an orange! Dad! Okay. Okay, I'll do it. I'll go back. Just stop throwing the gerbils.
All right. It's been a while. I'll try not to touch you too much. My hands are cold. They smell like turkey.
Josh? Here. Your new I.D. - Thanks, Veronica. - Good luck. You think you're nervous now?
You alright? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. and... and that's when you came up behind me. And... whatever it was that I saw... Wasn't. What do you mean?
Connor played a hunch and he was right. Sorry, riley. If we go strictly by your criteria we could miss the next opportunity. If there is one. Well i'm sorry, my database isn't set up to predict hunches.
Identical blood and identical DNA. Just got to figure out which one of them it belongs to. Antibodies, Eric. Antibodies. All the girls were born with the same blood.

What they don't know is that every time the body experiences a specific trauma, it builds antibodies to fight it. So you got different lives, different traumas. And Beth Selby's blood is going to show presence of anti-RH positive antibodies, which a woman's body produces when she's pregnant. Well, we find that in the blood, she's our killer. And thus, the antigen antibody test.
Oh, and the passenger seat, I've got lots of cow juice on it, so it's now at the back of Hammond's truck. (radio) At this afternoon, skys will be considerably cloudy, with showers and thunderstorms likely. Northeast winds, 5 to 10 miles per hour. Come on. Alabama's only 40 miles now.
Northeast winds, 5 to 10 miles per hour. Come on. Alabama's only 40 miles now. Our scrapyard cars had covered 650 miles and inevitably they were becoming more than just metal. This whole thing now really sums up why I love cars.
Alabama's only 40 miles now. Our scrapyard cars had covered 650 miles and inevitably they were becoming more than just metal. This whole thing now really sums up why I love cars. Now you take this Camaro, the dash is more plastic than an American newsreader, the engine's got less power than Belgium, the suspension is softer than journalism in an in-flight magazine, and of course it reeks of cow. But, I adore it.
Now we're alone you and I, I've got to admit to one or two very small faults with my Cadillac. First is that squeak, which is a loose belt or a belt ring or something. The other, it is fantastically slow this thing. I'm doing 55 and I'm putting my foot down. And I'm really struggling to get it up to 60
First is that squeak, which is a loose belt or a belt ring or something. The other, it is fantastically slow this thing. I'm doing 55 and I'm putting my foot down. And I'm really struggling to get it up to 60 If I'm honest, it does pull a little bit to the right.
Like a-a screwdriver? Nail gun? Ice pick? Yeah, something along those lines. Oh. Cold steel to the brain-- would that kill him?
I like nicknames. They are universal mnemonic devices. Why are we doing this? Don't we know that cause of death was brain scrambling due to an ice pick? The technical term is "pithing."
They are universal mnemonic devices. Why are we doing this? Don't we know that cause of death was brain scrambling due to an ice pick? The technical term is "pithing." And it's not how he died.
No? Fine! This is so fun! Steve's too busy with science and girls to play with me. I wrote a song about it.
You need to fix it 'cause it seems like you guys have a pretty good thing. And pretty good things are rare and hard to come by. Unlike really screwed up, complicated things which - seem to be everywhere. - You know, things are great.
I did. Take off your shoe. - You have type two diabetes. - Ten years now. You inspect your feet, notice anything?
Maybe the girl murdered her boyfriend in the swimming pool... and dumped his body in the reservoir. Very likely, provided you also believe she swallowed him whole and then... drove 20 miles down the motorway to regurgitate his remains. All right, then you explain it. We know it's the same beast in the pool and the reservoir. Perhaps the anomaly has a fixed point of origin in the past.
Well, the DNA is conclusive. It's the boy from the swimming pool. Or what's left of him. That's a bolus. A regurgitated mass of flesh and bone.
What? You bugged me? Of course you did. That's how you found the Dodo, right? You were the one with all the secrets, swat teams, girlfriends-
I just keep thinking about that night at Monique's place. How you made sure I left with my wrench, the one with her blood on it. Well, it was your wrench. Why are you rehashing this? My ex-wife confessed in her suicide note, the case is closed.
- Uh, hey... - Your door was open. - Can I come in? - Uh, what are you doing here? I read your letter.
- Your door was open. - Can I come in? - Uh, what are you doing here? I read your letter. I had no idea it would be so sweet.
No. No, I don't want to bother her. She just got engaged. This therapy isn't just about recovering your memories. It's about you getting closure.
Bye. In every housewife's closet there's an article of clothing that tells you more about its owner than she would want you to know. It might be a shirt that she despises, but wears without complaint. Perhaps it's some lingerie she knows isn't hers, but refuses to discuss. Or a dress she once loved, that she can no longer bear to look at.

Yes, you can learn a lot about women from what they choose to wear.
I think that Brennan told Jones everything and he suspects that his bombshell bride killed the PI that he hired to tail her. He's protecting the love of his life! Okay, okay, listen to me, listen to me. You are making a lot of assumptions. We have just started the case;
That is a trapped spirit, captured on film, they ensnared at the precise moment it was traveling from this world to the other side. How can this happen? I think I have figured it out. A single touch from an incubus, she would be completely under its sexual control. The incubus father seduces Mrs. Jones and with the help of Enya, at the clinic, implants a piece of his soul.
John, before you go you should know... Jack and I made a deal. In less than an hour he's leaving this island on that sub, and it's a one-way ticket. The anomaly wiped out our communications. We have no way of contacting the outside world.
Come here. Come over re. Yeah. Let me ask you something? Does that, uh,nose ring hurt? What?
The ones who control you. No, I'm sick. You're sick. I'm sick. We're all sick.
Try to get me going. I want you to get your cock out. Come on, take it out. I want you to throb it, I want you to jerk off. I'm hard. Well, show it to me.
Oh. So did you focus on the couriers or food service people, the dozens of homeless people who are there looking for a bathroom, or really any members of the general public who are perfectly entitled to enter the courthouse? –No. –So when you said you searched exhaustively, it was just until you got tired. –Objection. –Sustained.
How am I supposed to do that? The shape of the Globe gives words power, you're the wordsmith - the one, true genius, the only man clever enough to do it. What words? I have none. You're William Shakespeare!
Once more unto the breach! I like that... Wait a minute! That words are mine! Oh, just shift!
Bring her in! Oh, God! Oh, God! What the fuck? Look at my tail, Edgar.
- The fire is the delivery system. - How's that? The bacteria gets picked up by the convection of the fire and then carried by the smoke. Firefighters get in contact with the air currents. The wounds get infected.
Okay. I better get that. Okay, if we're gonna find some of these spores, we'll wanna look right here. Where your guys likely contracted the anthrax. That area was already burnt over.
So someone built this smallpox genetic code based on a sequence that exists only in cyberspace. So someone can just build smallpox? Well, theoretically. The technology is relatively straightforward. We manufacture genetic material from chemicals all the time.
No, no, no.She wants to see me naked. She sent me flowers. She's just thanking you for the play. See, some people feel an emotion called gratitude- there's a card. - I suspected.
And on that day, Mr. Gilroy decided the suffering had to stop. The law says that if someone poses a deadly threat to the safety of others, you can protect them. Even if you have to kill to do so. Tyson Shaw was responsible for the suicides and drug overdoses of young women. He destroyed lives for profit. He was a brutal parasite who had to be stopped.
Can I speak with him at all? My husband died three years ago. I'm sorry. He died holding that... thing. I wanted to throw it out.
- Hundred percent. - Count me in. But if Raquel Welch shows up- - You have an out. I - I don't want the complaint actually filed.
He just disappeared into this, like, haze. I know this sounds crazy, but I think it was Lem. I think he wanted me to tell you this story. Maybe it means that everything's gonna be okay. Right? Let it go, man. It's just a dream.
My tomatoes are just coming in. - It's good to see you. - Yeah. You seem good, Junior, I gotta say. Fuck does that mean? I'm fucking incarcerated, for Christ's sake.
- The Havenaire. We met those 16-year-old hillbilly whores near the taxi stand. You want the old days, let's go there. We'll get a room, bucket of ice from the machine, bottle of Scotch, order up a couple of steaks... Now you're fucking talking.
Thanks, Bobby. Don't say shit to Carmela. Me and Tony almost got a summer place-- Down the Shore, remember, Tony? Any more stuffed mushrooms?
- My turn. And don't you ever tell the kids that about their grandfather. Of course not. So did you guys look at her hair? Was there powder burns?
Funny how everybody forgets that, huh? They are grateful, Tony. Jesus--! You know, you and your sister, you are emotionally blocked. I'm old, Carm.
You asked how the impossible could be possible. Hibernation. It's how you can appear dead when you're still alive. There's no other explanation. Hydrogen sulphide replaces the body's need for oxygen.
Our victim's still without a name, and doctors say he's in a permanent vegetative state. And Christopher Bowfield's prints weren't a match to the prints I lifted from the door of the ME van. Just means he didn't open the van door. I also checked the air bag in Bowfield's silver Mercedes. It was gone.
Detective, for me, "strange" is a relative term. Yeah, yeah. Ooh, uh... What am I looking at here? Let's say you were born without an ear. What we do is genetically alter the rat to remove its immune system, then attach the mold of a human ear with your muscle and bone cells inside.
Yeah, yeah. Ooh, uh... What am I looking at here? Let's say you were born without an ear. What we do is genetically alter the rat to remove its immune system, then attach the mold of a human ear with your muscle and bone cells inside. Because the rat has no immune system, it won't reject your human cells.
He's sweet and charming and gorgeous. Like his brother. Yeah, kind of like that. I'd be mad, but you're right. He really is awesome.
Distinguished guests, parents, and this year's graduating class. My best friend reminded me of a quote by William Shakespeare that seems appropriate. "There is a tide in the affairs of men, "which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. "Omitted, "all the voyage of their life is bound up in sorrows and in miseries. " Mayor Scott, would you like to hold your beautiful niece?
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat! Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell! It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
Everybody's gonna be going shoeless tonight, Turtle. So don't think your smelly feet are getting any special attention. There's gonna be a sign right there that says "No shoes" and a basket right there to house them. Well, you might want to get a sign and a basket for bras, 'cause these sorority girls, they sound kinda freaky.
Trust me, Jake. You want to be a good little soldier here. And if I'm not? If you're a bad little soldier, Well, that dear old mom of yours, That adorable little sister...
WOMEN [SINGING]: ADAM: WOMAN 1: WOMAN 2: WOMAN 1: WOMAN 3:
I'm good. How are you? I'm all right. So I'm just going over this little speech I'm gonna make. I've been asked to say a few words today but only a very few, because quite frankly the time for words has drawn to a close and action desperately needs to take its place.
Yeah, alright. When this is done, I want this on air within fifteen minutes. I'm terrified, Sam. You'll be fine. You want justice because you believe an innocent man is in prison.
Case was wrong. -The kidnapper might have a point. -You are joking. Ray, you handled the forensics on that rag that was found in Charley's mouth, didn't you? Here we go.
I have never seen you before. How long have you lived among my people? I only arrived a few days ago. Where are you from? She is a friend of mine from another world.
That guy in there, he seemed genuinely surprised when you accused him of working with the Wraith. Why would he deny it if it was true? I would think that would provide an even more effective threat to get us to talk. So they just happened to arrive here moments after the settlement was culled? I find that a coincidence.
Show me where, Goat Turk, and I'd be happy to. Where's the front door? - Yeah, that's a gill. - Yeah, it is. Bring those horns down here.
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! I just don't want to end up like my aunt Sheila and get married and have a kid when I'm 50.
I told 'em.I told 'em,but would they listen? No,no,just an old man running off at the mouth. -Did you see this happen? -No. Woke up this morning and found it like that.
No,no,just an old man running off at the mouth. -Did you see this happen? -No. Woke up this morning and found it like that. I shot an arrow into the air, and it fell to earth I know not where.
.... Two holes. And then I went and I dumped his body into the culvert. Me, by myself. Right now the D.A.'s not sure who he's going to charge. What he needs from us is the most accurate timeline we can provide.
I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy. And the natural form of these invaders is not human. They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons. And man's weapon against them is the sword. Cut off the tail, the serpent lives.
- I hope so. And what about the other part? The part about they found the plane and we're all dead. One thing at a time. There's not a single audible channel.
No record, but he's got a motive. You know, it doesn't really track. O'Neil was an A-list player. His agent said he picked this movie over a big budget film in Toronto. Well, maybe the movie in Toronto was more risky.
That's so brilliant. I've always wanted to go to New York. I mean, the real New York, not the new, new, new one. Well, there's the genuine article. So good, they named it twice.
I'm no psychologist, but I believe the best way to relieve anxiety is to talk about it. Do we know the cause, Alan? I... mm... hate... to... disappoint, but... whatever affect you have on me isn't neurological. I see your lips can certainly form the words properly. And that tongue of yours easily wraps around the most challenging of syllables.
I went numb. At some point, I lost myself. I started to pray because I often find consolation in my faith, and, one day... I heard a voice. –A voice? –Yes. It wasn't my own.
Well, I-I can't speak as to whether God spoke to this woman, but my view is he would certainly forgive her for her actions. For killing Sean Harmon? The Lord's powers of forgiveness are without limit. And in this case, there's also the eye for an eye principle. That justifies killing somebody?
You see what it's saying? It's 1013. Deacon's out there. Guys, I found a way to get our boys out. Hey, Johnny...
I can barely look. Did I pop a stitch ? No, it looks alright. Have Catalina bring up more towels and I'll call the doctor. Luckily nothing fell out before the doctor could restitch Little Chubby.
Now, I come to you, that is an opportunity. Be wise and take advantage. Now, can you fix the ectricity just like you fixed the water? At's not that simple. The water pipes are inside the prison.
I've answered every one of your questions. I've acquitted myself the best that I can. Now what can I do to make you trust me? I don't trust anybody today. We have the picture.
Papo, Cheo and Sammy. I know, but it's the only other cell on the 2nd floor with a direct line to the fence where we won't be seen - by the other tower guards. - What guarantees they won't be there? By 2pm, everyone'll be out in the courtyard for the lunchtime soccer game.
But everyone runs away after the sunset out of fear. Tell me what to do? Okay, okay. When the cot is polished, keep it there. Does it look like a cot to you, it is a bed, a royal bed.
An ailment or something else. The one who told her that she is upstairs, but she was not. That's our patient. What did you say her name was? - Radha. Adha. - Radha, and not Adha.
Not here, somewhere else. Mr. Badri, please keep two chairs outside. - Yes. Okay. Son, don't get me wrong. But with my entire experience, and the affection that I have for you I am warning you.
But then... NO! NOOO! It's been taken from me. I have dry balls.
Song? You didn't say anything about a song before. - What song? - The Imagination song? That could be it.
big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and - It's a-! Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel. Hey, it talks! The little squirrel talks.
You're great, holding on to 336 Of course, I told you to follow suit Living the good life just beware of the anti-corruption guys Don't talk nonsense Cheung, you're really loyal Why don't you throw this crappy car away? .
I've said it many times before I didn't kill my wife Bugger off if you don't have enough evidence Pour a glass of wine for the lnspector You've probably never tasted a $30,000 bottle of wine Poor cops rarely taste the fine things in life
Start the line feeds. - There goes the gene solution. - The life blood. Gotcha! Look!
If some how you reach this in sir's hands.. ..my work will be done. Ok. I will do it. Did you not hear? A ghost is hiding in her.
I will just take a bath and come. Calling on the phone even in the bathroom? It is long back they are all ready. - ls father ready? The ghost that came yesterday came again today.
You serious? Yeah, my boss told me that uh... he'll see to it I'm stuck writing speeding tickets for the next 15 years. I told him I don't mind; you can't get all twisted around writing speeding tickets. you don't need a haircut. Cut it anyway.
You don't know the meaning of the word. You can love perhaps for a year or a month, a day even for an hour. And in that hour I do believe you love as well and deeply as any man. But after that hour, you love not. You love another and then another.
It's kind of a pre-insemination party. Good. I know you understand what I'm going through, Margene told me. Do you think you ever wanna have two or three more? Have a regular-sized family?
But this is a religion, Bill. And the believers believe in me. And there's nothing you can do to stop me. Do you understand what I'm saying? What do you want?
- Mrs. Epstein! Listen, I'm late for my Hadassah meeting. Here's the key. Take your time. Oh, and don't be shy.
- Shall we see if he's free Friday? - Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure. You know what?
It means, "Where do you want me?" Pink sugar! Sorry. Sorry, Mac. Listen, Katherine, most people go through their lives never having a chance to make a difference.
Let's get a blank ballot and try to demonstrate this. - Go. - All right. Dimpled number four... Bush. Could I have everybody's attention?
Well,he's not gonna grow up between now and dinner. Let's just go and try to have a good time. Yeah. try. oh,dear. Don't stir the rice.
she's not my boss! The room is simply lovely. You've outdone yourself. Thank you,mrs. Downing. Listen,when I present the founder's award tonight,I was wondering-- oh,dear. Has no one spoken to you? About what?
No! Dylan. Dylan, I'm sorry. - I had no choice! - No! and it had finally caught up with her. There's a ritual my friends have observed for years.
I just came from hip-Hop class. I have big news. I found the perfect apartment. Really? Yeah.
I'm just lying on the bed, all alone. Are you wearing those new panties l got you? Not anymore. Women don't really do this, do they? Yes.
And what is that? This is the heartbeat of the child that I'm carrying. I want you to watch it. And for once in your monstrous life, for you to think about someone else. Because this baby is not just some instrument for whatever wicked game it is that you're playing. It's your child.
- Don't you worry about that, it's just national television. So you have a wild catch strike We got a work out on Las Vegas, but it's not your typical strike because we're talkin' about strippers here. Their spokesperson is the president... of the Montecito Resort and Casino, Danny McCoy. So,Mr.McCoy,can you tellus what the strippers are up to get out the strike? Well, I guess, they...
Maudette was a fang-banger? How do you know that? I don't know, Sookie. The way that you just know things sometimes. There's also hookers who specialize in vampires.
We must find you a new husband. I have another gift for you. I am with child again. Your Majesty, councillors here is the new act, The Act of Succession which I am commanded to present shortly to the Houses of Parliament. The act nominates the children born of His Majesty and Queen Anne as first rightful heirs.
Oh, there was something else. I understand you have a wife and son. Yes. What's your son's name? Gregory.
It's got, like, four tracks, it's digital and everything." And I'm saying, "Hold it. "You know, I was thinking more along the lines "of a little... to get the riffs in." And then I come here, you know, and I find this old tape deck.
Nena, that's wonderful! - It was an accident, but still... - Did you tell your friends? - Well, Julia knows. - No, I mean your other friends.
(laughing) - Shhh! - l'm not complaining, but those hands of yours should be somewhere else. I could've gone to a guy, but I always end up punching them. Don't you ever smile? Doesn't matter.
Give him a meatball sub, a cold beer, nine innings and any Bruce Willis film where Bruce gets to fire a gun, and your basic male is happy. - Euphoric, even. - Yeah. But the female? Oh! The female has to have everything just so.
He's going to be okay, right, doc? Define "okay." - Not dead. - I don't know. Can't you tell us anything good about Earl?
Can't you tell us anything good about Earl? He has a fantastic mustache and, praise be to Ganesh it was unharmed. Other than that, all we can do is pray. I bet you wish you had more than one god now, uh? So, there I was, fighting for my life.
We... crave beauty. Like a piece of fine art by... any number of renowned artists. Or an arty photograph... of Cindy Crawford nude. That, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are...
Hey! I've been eavesdropping. I got Lady a real gift for our one-month anniversary. I cured her fear of the unknown. Women are like crows.
Come on, Jordan, think. There's got to be a way. Oh, my God, enough. You know, there might be something I can do to change his mind. So here's the truth,
I think it kind of separates you from all the rich, handsome, famous, successful, educated types. Flatter me all you want, you're still cut off. Listen, pal, my name is technically a brand. So I could sue you for naming that shot after me. First of all, you named the shot after yourself.
I don't know how to defeat it. You're jor-el's emissary.Do you have any ideas? The only way to destroy the phantom is to expose it to blue kryptonite. I don't understand. Everything affects us in opposite ways.
The shield. It's a kryptonian S.O.S. I found it in a time capsule that was buried over a hundred years ago. It may belong to this scientist. You may have found his beacon.
No. If kent was alive, he'd be back by now. Trust me -- he's long gone. Well... lucky you. But there is one problem.
I mean, look, if that's how you win wars, then i don't want to win. Then what? What do we do, dean? I got a plan. I'm not saying it's a good one.
The least ridiculous lie i can come up with in the next five minutes. Good luck with that. Not to pressure you or anything, - But what are you planning to do about us? - I'm gonna kill you.
Why? I don't understand. Hey,hot stuff, we can take care Of a few kitchen witches, thanks. I'm not talking about witches, you jackass. Witches are whores.
You're gonna give me a name. And if it's the right name... I'm gonna send you home warm and dry in a fresh set of clothes. If it's the wrong name, you'll be fed to the crayfish. They're American, these crayfish. Big, hungry bastards.
You don't know how much trouble you've caused... but please understand that I will kill you very slowly... if you don't tell me where my... The address is in my jacket. I wouldn't mess you around, Archy, it's in my jacket. What does it say? You want to know what it says, Len?
My name's Archy, formerly known as Archibald. I work for a man called Lenny Cole. And Lenny Cole has the keys to the back door of this booming city. Let me give you an example of how Lenny works his magic. Two years ago, this property cost 1 million pounds.
Yeah, she's a good girl, Jackie. You give her another drink. Yeah, you're right. He wouldn't give me his favorite painting, would he... if he didn't mean business? Yeah, I've took it off the easel, and I've put it on the wall.
The cars, the holidays, the tennis courts, the swimming pools. I own these bollocks. And right now, they're more fragile than a pair of quail's eggs. Now, get it done. Come back here. Where do you think you're going with that painting?
The Pastor's not here. You're a man now, Jakey. Uhh... The love of the Lord Jesus is as the ocean, vast and endless. We see it lap upon our shore.
Maybe a nice set of tits. And the poems? What about the poems? You have to compose the poem before you got there, right? Otherwise what, you're gonna blow out the guy's brains, sit down and write a little sonnet for yourself? No prints on the poems, so probably I wore gloves when I wrote it.
Help me wake them up and we'll get out of here. McKAY: All right, looking good. Rodney, it's being held together by a force field. I know. I just wanted to give the cells time to establish their own internal cohesion.
davis, you alrey got a ticket? and what were you doing in southampton? uh, i had to see this investor, charlie nadler, a big shot pain in the ass. wouldn't drive into the city. but the guy's connected, so i-- i thought you just picked up the car this morning.
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it? They've had a hell of a week. They're under pressure and stress. - Tell me about it. - They get back from work, if they work... A lot of them are single mums, they're exhausted.
- I'll fix you breakfast. - What happened? Apparently, a tornado touched down over at Four Tracks Corners. It turned over that rent trailer in the clearing. You know the one?
You sure? Because I haven't... Yeah. It's dead there, Bob. My God.
I thought the meetings amusing. Amusing? Obviously you're not an alcoholic. No, I'm not. Meetings are a discipline.
- What are you saying? - Hmm? They saw it, you see? They saw the statue. People are that gullible? No no. They're romantic.
Victor, we're meant to be going to a concert. - Are we? When? - Now. Would Mozart match your mood right now? I don't think he'd match mine.
If you can use them. 06-44-20-40-60. You be careful. Send me a text message. So I know you're okay. Women say they like fragile men.
Don't sweat it, Roland. You did your best. Did you impress upon Colonel Connor how important it was for him - to read my plan? - Yes, ma'am.
Nothing was going to change that. No. Death is a part of life. You can't have one without the other. It was too soon.
But to get a bunch of people worked up over something they can't do anything about, that's... Well, that seems a bit reckless. You just need to steer clear of Army policy, and we should be good to go. What about freedom of speech? First Amendment's one of my favorites.
It's just that I'm not going to have the energy for the bar business anymore. So I'm getting out. But re-opening is all you've talked about. Look, I know it still has a ways to go, but it's coming along. This place can only go on if you do.
Go play with your sister. Telling a kid we're black because we're sick is not a game! Camille! What? Was Agathe white before?
I mean, that's saying if you're planning to go to Barcelona, you'd better get your skates on, cos that really is the last call. HE LAUGHS So... Might get another cup of tea. Do you want one? No, best not.
# Into our lives # # Reach for a hand to hold # # Any wonder we need to find # # A certain something certain # # Turn out the light and what are you left with ? #
Look, you were a valued customer. I wanna make sure that stays in place. Fucking cunt. I hear that most people think that Porky getting done in is down to me. It's just fucking rumours, mate.
He was loyal. Honest. Old school. He was a fucking good businessman. Made me a lot of money, didn't he?
We had to take the box out of the trunk to get to the tools. You will never understand anything. It's silly of me to think you will. We had to take the box out of the trunk to get to the tools. That's why we moved the box.
For you. A dead canary? - It helped me to come here. To have a real life. You always laugh, but you do nothing.
I'd think twice, Tom. Rise and shine. Time to buy our house. - Tine... We're here to sign the compromise.
Mehtar ben Jaron, the international mandolin-star arrived to Hungary yesterday. Music is a bridge between people and me. I love Hungarians, I love to play for Hungarians. And Hungarian women, well... 'The Crab Crawls Backwards' That's the name of the foundation.
By bringing her alcohol? Come off it, Lieutenant. These girls are a lot older than their age. She is 14 years old. Yeah, but I spend all day online with these girls.
I found impressions inside the layers, but the leather was too pliant. And you're hoping the wood underneath kept the shape. Not anymore. What is that, is that a license plate? It happened during impact.
But when Tiffany sent astroboi her pics, it opened a direct link to his computer. I got his I.P. Address right here. That's as good as a phone number. Yeah. And all I have to do is figure out the internet account it belongs to.
I show them Cassie's binder, and I hope to scare them out of this chat room. You never found the girl? No, I think we scared her off, but patrol did find her pink hat on the other side of the park, and Natalia is processing it now. Is this the hit-and-run car? I thought Calleigh hit pay dirt with this.
Those people are officers of the law. And they took an oath to solve this murder. And right now,all of the evidence is pointing them directly to bryan woods. Now,maybe in the backs of their minds they're hoping it's not you,for my sake. But once you get in front of that jury there won't be any hope.
That's next-door to the Maddox house. Do you know what "swatting" is, Mr. Jackson? Killing flies? Try people. It's when someone places fake phone call to 911, causing SWAT to respond to a non-situation, and results in the injury of innocent people. And why would I know what that is?
I got a guy here that says he might be able to track the buyer. Thank God you're okay. It was crazy. The bullet just rolled off the table. Then the lab catches on fire.
You can get them. One, form a barrier. Two, check conditions and redirect when exits are blocked. Three, open exits and inflate slides. You're doing great right now.
That's disgusting. Bella, what do you think? Yes? That looks great. You said that about, like, the last five dresses, though.
It's called Hamlet 2. A sequel to Hamlet by Shakespeare? Yes. Yes. Do you think it's a bad idea? Not necessarily, no.
Pop round over the weekend, I'll give you the works. For fuck's sake, Poppy, it's assessments on Monday. I've got to get ready! Poppy had no idea how much work was involved on assessments weekend. I prided myself on being best. It was like being the best at anything. It takes hard work and preparation.
- Okay. There you go. It's okay. You can tell her. Zack wants me to tell you about those photographs.
Oh, these routines... - Have I seen these? - No. Not yet. That sure is a pretty car you have.
Gee, you think? Did my dad give you a name? I am the knight industries three thousand. You may call me Kitt. All right, Kitt, so where are you taking me?
You didn't say a word! Is this the guided tour of Flatey? Yes. Welcome to Flatey! Almost the northest island people are living on... in.
I mean, look around. Do you really think I fit in with that crowd in there? Who cares if you don't fit in? I've never fit in anywhere. Those girls in there are wearing masks.
Horse ain't the only thing he killed. He's a whole lot stronger than you think. Ever hear of the windigo? Sounds familiar. Spirit of the lonely places, a hateful thing that lives in the cold winds of the high mountains.
Duck, it has now become your meeting. Tell us what you see. I find myself a little unprepared here, but I know this. I'd like to bring this company into financial maturity. The last two years, we've been held back.
Are you serious? You can't be serious. I wanted other things. I don't understand. One day you're there... and then, all of a sudden... there's less of you,
You know he's going to ask you about the picture. What picture? Some new painting. He calls people in to see what they think. No, I think we're going to discuss expanding the television department.
I guess we can throw it in the mix. Let's start regional. See how some strangers'wives feel. I would recommend buying air time during Love of Life. Women watching TV during the day like to fantasize about having active lifestyles. They like where they could be going with Sea Ski.
I need to talk to a few people. It's OK, Eli. We've got it from here. We've got to inject now. Please step out of the way.
Right down to stalking his daughter? How is Maya? Those last three girls you killed, where are their bodies? 'Cause the families want closure, right? But... this ain't the movies.

I just see you as a... As a wrap dress with an overnight bag kind of a gal. You know, not a... Eight-piece luggage set type one? Are you a duchess? No. Then your house is too big.
Mm, you're infamous, Rush, but you're not famous, and only in a very narrow demographic. Oh, ha, ha. I'd try to outrun him if I thought this car of yours could do over 40 miles an hour. My car has more pickup than yours. Car and Driver. Look it up. Yeah?
You're an assassin. Your mistake. - He's dead? - Yeah. Bishop's tying up loose ends.
Any witnesses? Yeah, there were two uh... women with him here last night. Uh, but the family butler, one Grant Evans, who's lived on the premises for decades, he wasn't here last night. - Where was he? - We have a unit out looking for him right now.
' I'm sorry, darling, I should have called earlier. You know, I've been busy with the... The what? Hm? Finish your sentence, man! The case has been reopened.
Hello to you, too. Mom's out getting bagels, Dan's at the gallery, and the mail just came. I appreciate the play-by-play. It feel as if I'm there. Yeah, well, the letter came from Parsons about my internship.
Ow, ow! Stop, stop. Sorry, sorry. My ring's gone. My wedding ring. How am I supposed to get it back?
It is not supposed to be easy. Of course it is! What's the point of making tools if it doesn't make the job easier? Otherwise, why bother? Tell that to the bow and the arrow. I think it's these arrows.

I'm sure I will. Susannah will get me a pardon. And when it's safe for me to return to London, she'll put a notice in the London Gazette. You'll never see that. So we like about the Crusoes. We do choose our women well.
If it's here, I know where it'll be. "Crush the leaves. Boil until water clears." Listen, how much time do I have? Only hours. His fever hadn't taken hold.
Now what? Give it to me. Now who's giving the orders? It needs to be chopped. - You know that anesthetic you have? - Yeah. Is it strong enough to work from a dart?
Recalls are in the news again. Product recalls are this time affecting both high-school girls and a cosmetics giant. Officials at mineola high school had no choice but to cancel this year's senior prom after several students, including half the girls in the prom court, broke out in rashes. The common denominator? Reveal cosmetics' liquid mineral foundation.
- I'm not asking you to do anything. Although you do make a very strong case about the election. I mean, if this gets out, that'll be done. Did you seriously expect me to show up here, move her body, put it somewhere else, set it on fire, and make it all look like an accident? That's what Dutch would have done.
Well, let me talk to her. She's not gonna tell a big PI the truth and rat out her friend. I'm not gonna tell you anything about Nikki, okay? I've made up my mind. And you should know... my dad says my mind is like an old refrigerator in a deserted lot...
Who blew their nose and when? Sheldon, relax. She doesn't have any symptoms. I'm sure she's not contagious. Oh, please.
I'm nervous. - It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine. - Okay, joke. Okay. How about this? Um, okay.
within the intersection of "no longer want time machine"... and "need $800." It's actually a tremendous bargain. Even with shipping, it works out to less than $4 a pound. Cocktail shrimp are 12.50. How are we gonna get it upstairs?
You can feel it, just as i do. There's a connection between us. There's only one way to be sure. A memory stone. It contains my birth imprint.
If you're hearing this then you've finally found what you've been looking for. But is the discovery of my body enough? Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover the truth push you deeper into the abyss? Heed my warning: Do not proceed.
So? So what was she doing on the wrong side of the road? Monk. Check this out. What is it?
Okay,I don't care how much it costs. We're getting you into a program. Dad,you two are living parallel lives. Sammy,your mother and i are just fine. When two people have been married as long as we have,you learn to give each other space.
I hate your type the most. I'II permit you to see him once. Hei Tai Lam. You really miss him? Okay, I'II tell him to go.
- So that must bet he front cover. - Of course. - For us it'd be the back cover. - It's in Hebrew. - Yes, that's why... - Shall we set the table? - Yes. - Notice the paper? - Yes.

How does she feel about all of this? Like I told thomas¡ª she didn't even know I sent the email arranging the meeting. It's me who's to blame. Quite an entrance. Just some friends from a previous life.
Omer goes off to work, I make some coffee, have a cigarette, turn on the TV... "Survival" was on the TV. Remember? You know, those serials. I loved when they were showing those giraffes.
Who wouldn't like to have her husband home? Why don't you tell her the truth? - What could I say? What if he really survived? Let's go!
Sorry, we don't have a lot oftime. We should visit the owners. Don't cry! At least you have a mum! We have no mum and no dad. Leave that! Mrs. Safija, you know why are we here.
It's reactonary. And with the educational reform... Please, stay out of this. It'll ensure you get into university. You yourself said those nuns smell like cat piss!
Do you have any questions for us, Mrs. Davies? No, Celia explained it all. She always had a head for science. Gabriel does too. He wants to be a marine biologist. ACT is 224.
No, I keep it a secret so people won't hate me. Sweetheart, nobody hates you. All my foster families do. That's why I keep getting moved. Listen to me, grownups can be really weird sometimes.
- Yeah. I wanted to call it off, the session, but... I wasn't sure i'd be able to make it home alone. I took a cab here. My car's at home.

Sure. It's amazing, because pretty much the same thing happened to me. That night when he came over for dinner, my dad was still at work. So we sat on the porch... and caught up. I was painting my toenails.
What we need is angry sex. That's what we had. That's what held us together even when we wanted to kill each other. Probably because we wanted to kill each other. This touchy-feely sex wasn't the deal. The kind of sex we used to have, I couldn't even tell my girlfriends about it, nobody would have believed me.
Wait a second. There we go. - Are they your daughter's? - Mm-hm. - Well, did you ask her if it was OK? - No, but I'm sure she won't mind.
To my shame. Who bore it to the people? Flash gordon... Son of lawrence gordon, Whom we once looked to for our future. "The water bearer is the ruler reborn."
Honestly Steven, we didn't raise him with restricted television privileges, just so he could develop a disturbing interest in carnage. So, Carol, if you were a turtle in this game. What would you do? Why, I'd ride on my back like a skateboard. Genious!
- All right, Ed walked toward the can. - Killer must've been behind Ed. He slipped in when he opened the door. Killer was that close, Ed would've popped him. Door opens.
Right, I won't be long. If the taxi beeps, give me a shout. It is driving me mad. Ten minutes past 1:00, every night, bang on the dot, without fail, the burglar alarm goes off. I've had experts in, I've had it replaced, I've even phoned Watchdog.
So, come on then, Miss Foster, those pills, what are they? Well, you might as well have a scoop, since you'll never see it printed. This is the spark of life. And what's that supposed to mean? Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes them away.
Well, you might as well have a scoop, since you'll never see it printed. This is the spark of life. And what's that supposed to mean? Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes them away. Well, it certainly attracts them, that part's true.
You can't tie me up. What sort of a country do you think this is? Oh, it's a beautifully fat country. And believe me, I've travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale. So, come on then, Miss Foster, those pills, what are they?
- Try 7,000. Well, that's less than infinite. All right, look. It's going to get very, very noisy when the Genii get here. Screaming?
We don't leave this forest until all three of them are dead. What took you so long? I thought for sure we'd lost you! I ran into Genii. Had to lie low until it was safe to move. - So what happened?
I wanted to thank you, Colonel. I know they never would've let me go if you hadn't put in a word for me. Well, you saved my life. Putting a word in is the least I could do. I have to admit, I'm a little scared.
Cool. Do you know where Daddy is? No, I agree with you, Mom. Yes. No, I agree with Oprah.
I'm a detective with the Phoenix Police force. I'm investigating the murder of a young boy. - I'd like to ask you some questions. * I simply remember... * What was the color of that other jacket?
25 girls from villages in North India lured to the city on the pretext of giving jobs... were being taken from Mumbai to Goa. With the help of some soldiers, Kalpana rescued them. lnvestigations reveal that organs have already been harvested from these girls. Several girls have been operated surgically and their kidneys have been removed.
Two more to go. - Great! I sold the jewellery meant for my wedding. Dear husband to-be, I don't think, you care for a dowry. So, I bought a car.
You seem like a nice man. I have trouble imagining you hurting anyone. I appreciate that. Mind if I ask your opinion about something? No, of course not.
I appreciate that. Mind if I ask your opinion about something? No, of course not. My... my daughters, Myra and Chloe, they're sitting in the, in the waiting area... I think I passed them on the way in.
So what is it? What is what? You didn't come all the way here to get back a pad and some pens. You're dying to tell me something. Just remember our agreement.
- We caught a break. Hastings, that security guard from the Museum who's still missing, had a few assault charges on his record that never went to trial. Hastings is way more violent than we thought. - And we found the car finally. - They found his car.
- You did not. I didn't? Does thinking it count? They might have a snack bar. You know, maybe that truck wasn't gray, dude.
There is pressure. All right, I'm worried I may have waited too long and missed my window of opportunity for sex. What? He's a guy. The sex window is always open.
In thousands of years. And everyone will remember you. What about you, Evelina? Can you see anything? The visions have gone.
That's because you can't hear them. They welcomed it. It's not as if they put up a fight. You idiot. They're born with their brains in their hands. Don't you see? That makes them peaceful.

Most things we spend our lives searching for Usually are right in front of us. There is one thing I don't quite understand. You say you've been searching your whole life. But I thought you didn't learn about veritas until recently. I've always known my father was covering a secret... A secret of cryptic symbols and mystic stones.
What the hell is a bail bondsman for then? Bigger numbers. Just the fee, that's 1,000 dollars, you'd still have to collateralize. With what? I mean, even if I sold my car, maybe I'd get about 1,200 bucks and then how do I get to my second job?
I work with sentient beings, each worthy of the same respect that humans, even animals, receive automatically. These creatures are the key to the evolution of our race, past and future, and yet we revile them, destroy them, and worst of all, pretend they don't even exist. But they are out there, Dr. Zimmerman. Lost, like the child you saw tonight. Misunderstood, hunted...
See ya! Three not-so-dead women found in coffins. Just another day at the office. All three are comatose. Fortunately, brain functions and vital organs seem to be intact.
- What the hell are you doing? - Saving your life. Why? You've had a long night. I'm simply glad to see you safe and sound.
I can't account for myself when I'm that thing. I mean, what if I hurt one of you? I can't let that happen. So you either chain me up in the Shoe or you tell me how I can stop all this. I need to know what my choices are.
Well, perhaps a piece of that chicken. I'm not the man I was, you see. Not since I had my brains half knocked out on the bloody fields of Sebastopol. Still... best look sharp. I swore I wouldn't rest till I found my missing girls.
What is keeping them? My sister and I would like to... We would like to present our father in a manner befitting two constant daughters. Father? You there? It's been so many years, but now, he's been restored to us.
Don't expect me to ride shotgun on your "woe is me" interstate. You're smart, and you know it. So get off your ass and start making something of yourself and start making something of yourself I know that box is still very important to him. I don't think Kyle would want you to handle it.
Exactly. So how about this? I'll tell you something you don't know about me, and then you tell me something I don't know about you. Yeah okay.
But they came back because they realised they were wrong. For all the dramas that came over the horizon, there were more wonders of humanity right here amongst us. # Always young and fair to me # So fair to me... For some of us, the world turned.
till yesterday we thought that they were girlfriend and boyfriend, right? But just today dolly tied a huge rakhi on Tiny's hand. Poor chap was crying... Booohooo. What do the poor guys do?
So most frogs only leave their shelters at night. Since they cant absorb sunshine directly they either get their heat from their surroundings or draw their energy from the fat reserves that they built up when the feeding was good. But even so they seldom hop unless they have very good reason to do so. This frog however the South American waxy monkey frog is exceptional. Its one of the few that can tolerate direct sunshine for any length of time.
So they have a problem. But they also have a solution secret sunbathing. You really cant see them until youre right on top of them. And theres one there. Im in Arizona and that at my feet is a lizard buried in the sand up to its neck.
Even while its buried it can use the sunshine to warm its whole body. It can control the supply of blood to its head so that it pools in a cavity behind the eye. Soon the blood there is as much as five degrees above the temperature of the rest of its body. Then the animal opens the major blood vessels in its neck and the hot blood circulates so that its whole body is thoroughly warmed even though its still mostly below ground. This is a horned lizard and very beautiful too.
Theyve turned it into a social activity. Whole families of them live together in the crevices among the rocks and in the morning they all emerge to warm up in the sun. Of course there is safety in numbers. There are lots of eyes to spot danger if it appears. And when one sunbather takes fright they all dive for safety.
By collecting solar power so efficiently reptiles need to use very little of the energy they generate themselves to warm their bodies. In fact they use around a tenth compared with a mammal of a similar size. That means they dont have to eat very often. A puff adder like this one can wait almost indefinitely for its next meal. Amongst predators patience really is a virtue.

Amongst predators patience really is a virtue. Whilst waiting for a meal to wander within striking distance a snake shuts down its body processes so that it uses the minimum amount of energy.
A puff adder like this one can wait almost indefinitely for its next meal. Amongst predators patience really is a virtue. Whilst waiting for a meal to wander within striking distance a snake shuts down its body processes so that it uses the minimum amount of energy. Only the equivalent of a pilot light is left on and it can remain like this for weeks. All around it mammals are expending their energy in a way that compared with the snake seems extraordinarily extravagant.
This gigantic python is feeding on a deer. A python kills its prey by wrapping its coils around it and squeezing its victim so tightly and for so long that it can no longer breathe. But swallowing its meal takes time. The deer will go down head first. Its much easier that way.
Here, Beto. - Thank you. That's nice, what do we have here? A shirt and a watch. - Terrific.
It's not real. Lots of feeling here. All these cars were once brand new. A lot of these cars were someone's very first car. Remember your first car?
I heard him say your name, bethany. He went outside, and then i saw you. I stood at the window. I couldn't even breathe. I saw you hit him with the racket.
The police report said his gun discharged when he was cleaning it? Well, that was because of the pension. If it had said the other, There would have been no pension. I understand.
You have any connection to the corrections department? No, sir. Not anymore. Good luck today. Yeah, okay.
My husband. He's around here somewhere on a call. I got a car. It has a back seat. It got-- it got shot up.
What did you see? I don't know. It was waiting for me. This way. Owen's body's undergoing some kind of transformation.
This way. Owen's body's undergoing some kind of transformation. His cells aren't decaying, they're changing. Into what? An energy I can't identify.
I want to make a complaint! Enough. You're dead. You break your ankle, what are the chances it'll knit back together? You want to add a wheelchair to your prob... problems?
Not long to go now. - Tosh isn't responding. - Then let's get going. Sure you're ready for this, Owen? You know what a Nostrovite can do.
It's three times what the city already paid. Which wasn't very much to begin with. I don't know what Mr. Powell has promised you, but are you willing to bet 20 million he's right? We'd get this money on top of what the city already paid us? Those checks can't compensate for the loss of the homes you raised your children in, your grandchildren in.
If your gas was going to be cut off, neighbors chipped in to pay the bills. That spirit is still there. You just have to look past the peeling paint. Objection. Relevance?
Kirstie Alley is saying that rumors... that she has regained the weight she lost... on Jenny Craig are not true. She knows we can see her, right? It's not some kind of Scientology invisibility cloak? And finally, the most important women's news item there is: We have our first serious female presidential candidate... in Hillary Clinton.
I'm finished! From the creators of "Lipstick Jungle" and "Cashmere Mafia"... comes a new drama about four beautiful, powerful... unrealistic women working in New York City. There's Nicolette. In the cutthroat world of business, she holds the knife. Now that I've been made a partner in this law firm... there's going to be some changes!
Said that you wouldn't listen. That you were too arrogant to face reality. Reality? You have no idea what that word even means any more. The world changed.
We talk it out, we find a middle ground. Just-just like in business. Or countries at war. So where's Mom in all this? She's Switzerland.


A really lovely reptile. The kingsnake pretends to be venomous when its not. And theres another snake that pretends to be dead when it isnt. Snakes being cold-blooded seem to relish the warmth of sun-baked roads and often bask on them. And as a result of course many get run over.
And the gulls always go for the snakes head. One in 1 0 of the snakes are totally blinded. Tiger snakes dont have those heat-sensitive pits that rattlesnakes have so these blinded hunters must be guided entirely by their forked tongue. Its a superb direction-finding device. The snake can measure the strength of a smell separately on each of the two forks of its tongue.
The snake can measure the strength of a smell separately on each of the two forks of its tongue. And if it wishes to follow up a smell then it simply detects the one that has the stronger smell and goes in that direction. Gull chicks are an ideal prey for a blinded snake because they are programmed to stay on their nests. Once a snake has located it a chick is doomed. Snakes it must be admitted have had a bad reputation ever since one appeared in the Garden of Eden.
The trees it frequents also hold colonies of masked weaverbirds that suspend their nests from the very tip of the branches. But the snake is a skilled enough climber to reach them. The weaverbirds know it well and recognise it as a threat. (CHIRPING) Its well accustomed to these attacks.
But the snake is a skilled enough climber to reach them. The weaverbirds know it well and recognise it as a threat. (CHIRPING) Its well accustomed to these attacks. These defenders however are just too determined and it retreats.
What would be crazy is if I just let myself starve to death. It's not that I can't handle defeat, but if I lose to Melvin Palmer— –Have you ever lost to him? No. But no matter how hard I smack him down, He just keeps getting back up again. He reminds me of this inflatable bobo doll I had as a kid.
It's not that I can't handle defeat, but if I lose to Melvin Palmer— –Have you ever lost to him? No. But no matter how hard I smack him down, He just keeps getting back up again. He reminds me of this inflatable bobo doll I had as a kid. I'd knock it down, and it would come back up, smiling.
I'm with the cinema caravan. On Saturday evening, you are scheduled to watch a movie. Stop the engine, I can't hear you. Come again? Stop the engine, I can't hear you.
Do you know anyone who wanted to harm her? Yeah... I know exactly who did it. It's the guy I used to share my cell with- - Boyd Waldrip. I told him about my wife Grace, what a good woman she was and how lucky I was to have her.
He asks if I mind taking the job in with him. We were first on the scene. - Inside we found... - Found this. The ax had been left behind, but it had been wiped clean.
But he would have known that the kids were in the house? He only hurt the parents and then left. Okay, so using a weapon he found at the scene and not eliminating all of the potential witnesses, that makes him disorganized. But he left no evidence, which suggests he's organized. There was a fingerprint.
He only hurt the parents and then left. Okay, so using a weapon he found at the scene and not eliminating all of the potential witnesses, that makes him disorganized. But he left no evidence, which suggests he's organized. There was a fingerprint. But it was behind the bedroom door.
I have to check my messages. Sweetie, it's Mom. Listen, Johanna, I'm sorry to bother you with this, but the strangest thing just happened. These two women came to visit me here at the store. One of them was a private investigator and they both seemed to be under the impression that something... that something terrible happened to you nine years ago.
Our competition, Samba, is, uh, right above us, so there's a lot of pressure on the bow team at nighttime. Tonight's gonna be a big opportunity for either one of us to push away. Nighttime racing is, uh, where you can really make huge gains. And it's hard to see your competitors. They can, uh, pull a maneuver without you seeing.
A way to treat the sick. Go on. This strain of TB has become mutated. It's resistant to every drug developed in the last 20 years. How are you going to treat it?
How long ago was that? 2 years ago. I was in ohio before I left to come here. Wasn't there anything they could do? Yeah,you'd think,but this particular aneurysm was in a place so deep in my brain that they couldn't get to it.
The CAT scans show lesions and that says PML. PML is caused by the JC virus, right? Correct. 80% of the population has JC in them. In normal people, the virus hangs out in the brain... Yeah, and it's kept in check by the body's immune system.
So I guess the answer is: Sure, it could and probably does exist. That's the answer I wanted. You and I should get together some... Whatever. But this virus is not benign, David.
This is in London? This, is in London. My great grandfather was sixteen when he signed up to fight for his country, just a boy from Brentford, a nobody really, just a kid lying about his age. He was given a medal which was passed down to me for serving from 1914 to 1915. There's not many of those around for obvious reasons.
We need to destroy their hope. Well, that's not exactly what I... I think you should take their precious hope, and the rest of their land, and burn it all to the ground. Yes, yes, you're right, Azula. Sozin's Comet is almost upon us.
But you found it again, and you did it by yourself. And i am so happy you found your way here. It wasn't that hard, Uncle. You have a pretty strong scent. Wait, is it just me or those mounts getting bigger?
Oh, that's a tv? It looks like a refrigerator. Who's it from? It just says, "local businesses support local heroes. " And where do these local businesses think we're gonna put that thing?
Everyone to battle positions! Dr Jones, if you're not too busy. I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir. And? There's no signal!
Anita, if he dies, I'll kill him! What about the Vashta Nerada? These are their forests. I'll seal Charlotte inside her world, take everybody else away. The shadows can swarm to their hearts content.
Director's back end of the week. I want to go home. I miss mkids. I miss San Diego. Missed my damn flight because of this case.
Oh, I hope there's no tornados. You know what they say about tornadoes and trailer homes... Gear. Go. Get back. Wow, should've seen that coming. Looks like we missed the twister.
That's normal, they're my family. Your family is here now, and it is large and very important. -Yes, but... -We show little love for God if we don't detach ourselves from what we leave behind. Let me confess something:
Very good. It's a rhabdomyosarcoma. A very aggressive form of cancer and extremely serious at her age. Very few people recover. I think you should know that.
- That's not what I said! - I want to go home. I'm sorry. I want to be safe. You'll be safe, the rescue truck is on its way. What happens then, Doctor?
What the hell's making that noise? She said she'd get me. Stop it, make it stop, somebody make it stop! Don't stand there looking at me, not my fault, he started it with stories. - Calm down!
Roger is dead and he can't even mourn him. 1926, it's more like the Dark Ages. Did you inquire after the necklace? Lady Eddison brought it back from India. It's worth thousands.
So, what does this masterpiece have to do with the cryptograph? Only one sketch existed of the clock After it dpeared during the second world war. The gears on that sketch match this exactly. So nobody knows where the clock is now? It was lost for decades.
I've been seeing someone. You're in love with him? I didn't mean for it to happen. But all the doctors said you wouldn't get better, and it's, it's not like I could hang on to how great things were. I cheated on you, didn't I? That's not the reason.
Mrs. McCann, look, if you know anything, anything at all, you need to tell me, because it'll help us find your husband. The car was totaled. When I went to get our things out of it, I found a cashier's check in Jay's briefcase. It was for $100,000 made out to cash. And who was this cashier's check from? It was from Jay.
I Fart Huckabees. Aw, this one again? God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now! Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car. Oh?
You're making that kind of difficult. Not half as difficult as I plan to make things for those two. JIM: No, Kate. What happened to your hand? Oh, halfway through dinner last night, I realised I was still wearing my wedding ring.
Do you, um... Do you put much stock in dreams? Not really. Me either. It's always water.
Get to know them. Get them to trust you. Thanks. and see if they have any available internships. Or maybe I can help you. Have you ever flown private before? A dear friend of mine is interviewing people at her estate in Palm Beach.
You went up like 100 points. That's awesome! Yeah. I needed to go up like 200 to make up for freshman and sophomore year... It's fine. Well, this is still really good. Can I say something?
That issue has not been put to bed, yet. We had a meeting, with the superintendent. The funds are frozen. Who had a meeting? Well, the boosters, and the mayor, and the superintendent, and all the people I've been out trying to get money from, for the Jumbo Tron.
Greggs had till the end of the week to make good. Otherwise? Otherwise... I'd get some use out of that new shovel I bought. Now I'm gonna talk to all these people over here.

I can't believe th... - I can't believe you would do this. - Come off it. What's so awful? You know there's always a catch in a deal with me. What does that even mean?
Are you okay? Has everyone in Hartland lost their minds? People are afraid. - They're looking for someone to blame. - Wizard's First Rule:
How do you know this, boy? Because she's my mother too. You would betray your own mother? She betrayed Brennidon. She's not my mother anymore.
Oh, really? Well, you know, that's very sensible, because UFOs don't exist. But I assure you, there is a monster loose, and it's bouncing through our language, frantically trying to keep its host alive. Is this transmission itself- No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. If the bug enters us, it does not enter by making contact with our eardrum. No. It enters us when we hear the word and we understand it. Understand? It is when the word is understood... that the virus takes hold.
Who cares? I just... I still think we should have a plan, that's all. I do have one. And here it is.
- All right? - How's it going? Since about five minutes ago? Fine. Great. I'm trying to find the common room.
Fluff up your pom-poms, ladies. This weekend our very own Titans are taking on the AM Farmhands in the Basketball Conference Championship! There'll be tons going on this week.

sort of invite you in, sort of intoxicating. Well, the thing that fascinates me about it., and always has about the six strings, no one has ever approached... They all play in a different way and, you know,. their personality comes through. During my time as a songwriter and performer, I've kind ofwatched and felt that I was seeing the end of the guitar as a kind of focus for popular music. And yet every time I think it's kind of counted out. it flares up somewhere else. I keep guitars that are.. you know...
Let's take a hit wedding song... and do a rock remix But... a wedding remix in a rock album...? Why... is it against the law to do that? Everything goes The main thing is, the album should be a hit
Now, you listen to me, honey. This is ridiculous. That girl was upset and vindictive, and she told a bunch of lies about Darren because he broke up with her. He broke up pretty hard, sir. I bring you these photographs of Michelle Clarke, courtesy of the nurse who performed the rape exam.
From the outside, this crime looks all kind of show biz-y. But the second... The second we make an arrest, the murder becomes a domestic dispute between a hairstylist and a wannabe actor, and that's not news in Los Angeles. Let me give you the whole picture here. Ricardo Ramos is writing a two-part article, as we speak, on Priority Homicide.
Good luck. You son of a bitch. I hope you win that damn gold medal! The women's handball team made it to the Olympic semifinals. That's right.
You son of a bitch. I hope you win that damn gold medal! The women's handball team made it to the Olympic semifinals. That's right. They were the top team in Group B where they had three wins and one draw.
But, you also saved Allison's son. Doing the right thing for the wrong reason is still a mistake. Rook on G7 to G8. That's not what I'm talking about. Some things can't be forgiven.
That. Okay, what are we gonna do now? We go back to where it started. Things were just starting to die this morning. Yeah, it's like the whole garden's been torched.
- Relax. I'll talk to 'em. - I already tried that. They said they have no idea how the diamonds got into the dogs. Likely story. Okay, first, leave the interrogations to me.
No, first atomic bomb was... Los Alamos? They learned from our mistakes and went with plutonium. We used a rare element found only in certain meteorites. The first test was flawless.
I'm not leaving and you're not staying. Our love knows no separation. Besides, you need to keep practicing with other girls. Be careful. Once they sleep with you, they'll never want to let you go. Look.
yes, which is why i want you to go there, access their computers and their databanks. based on the building schematics, my best guess is the main office is on the 12th floor. ? once you get in, the computer are going to be encrypted, which is why you will need this. megafreeze spray.
She loved to party. We had a lot of laughs together. Aside from that, I really don't know that much about her. If you didn't know that much about her, why would you lend her your car? I'm a generous person.
You're building a haunted house? By despising me, you've kindled my ambition. When I succeed, when I'm rich and famous and you suffer, inferior and alone remember it was your scorn that got me going and eat your heart out. Anyone starving will eat a cat if there's a cat in front of them. The cat is not dead.
I hate that. It doesn't have to be bowling. I just think you should get out. You really don't believe I saw a ghost, do you. Well, would a real ghost say 'ghost! ' like that?
Well, I-I don't. I was raised to be a gentleman. So... this is Akiko, Vanessa and Melody. She's new to our family. Ladies.
I mean, him and Oscar were close. Miguel, I need to talk to you about something else. Uh-oh. I remember that look. Chicky hines. He didn't do that carjacking homicide.
Uh, we need a parent present to take kid's statement. Father's not in picture, but we got a call in to the mother. Got this? We need to roll. Take care out there.
The basement? We call the project Babylon. It's a sophisticated computer program. An artificial intelligence. During the blackout, the AI reserved generator power for itself and in doing so, shut down the building's other systems.
A lot of money. Aren't you worried they've got your software now? -That they'll pass it off as their own? -No. My son built security measures into the code.
Let's go. I did this to you. I'm sorry. What is this about? You don't know what this is about?
In the near future a computer system called Skynet takes over the world. It sends humanoid machines back in time to eliminate anyone who's a threat. I have a target list. Your name is on it. A machine is coming to kill you.
Not their houses, or their jobs, or their habits, but their deepest, truest selves. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? I used to be a waitress. They killed her too. Tell me about your lab.
What do you think we're doing? Shirking our responsibility or something? You know, we've been doing an excellent job around here even before you showed up, so regulate yourself, okay? I think maybe there are still a few unresolved issues. We're still questioning the female students.
That sounds dangerous. Is it something along the lines of, "Oh, look out for Ian Wexler. He's a young genius on the rise"? How can you flirt with me while ignoring your phone? Well, I am a man of perspective.
Is it something along the lines of, "Oh, look out for Ian Wexler. He's a young genius on the rise"? How can you flirt with me while ignoring your phone? Well, I am a man of perspective. Besides, I find if one ignores the thing long enough, generally, it stops ringing.
If you're relying on superstition for safety, I should carry the gun. No, you are definitely not carrying a gun. Give me some space, all right? Is that legal? Look, if anybody asks, the door was open.
They always get their pound of flesh. I understand that you think I acted too emotionally. Putting aside that men always say that about women they work with I'll get straight to the point. I am emotional. I do bring it into my work. It's what motivates me.
But I hope you don't. You're not getting off that easy, Agent Dunham. I'll see you in the morning. A spike in the price of oil again sent tremors through the financial markets. But for pure shock value, nothing beat today's very public detainment of Intrepus' David Esterbrook by the FBI.
Ours are based on the Asgard drives, with our own little twist. The Ancients had their own particular system, and the Wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology. - All right. - Okay, so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace. Okay, this much I already know. Yes.
It was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a hundred generations, and it was leveled in an instant. I was in orbit when it happened. We could see the explosion from space. I've never witnessed anything that powerful. The gates are made of naquadah.
I don't know. I mean, I... I guess I'm making progress. I found out what was killing them. You did? The treatment worked exactly like it was supposed to.
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, there was a treatment of last resort. All right, all right, spare me the history lessons. A terminally ill Wraith could occasionally restore himself to perfect health if he allowed an iratus "bug," as you call them, specifically a queen, to feed on him. And you're just bringing this up now? The process was abandoned long ago because it is dangerous, almost always resulting in the death of the Wraith in question.
Go ahead and try it. Whenever you're ready. Okay... Fingers crossed. - What are you doing?
But when I speak, when I... offer them to others... they seem to lose all definition. It is not your words that are at fault, John. It is the bias of those to whom you speak that distorts what you would say. A bias. We cannot survive a war, this country... no no... neither with England nor France.
Yes, well, I remind you that Mr. Hamilton is no longer an officer in this government. And I have no need of outside counsel. With respect, Mr. President, you spent most of the war abroad. Mr. McHenry and I had the privilege to serve with Mr. Hamilton in the army and in the previous cabinet... I... I retained all of you in your present positions in the interest of... national unity.
"A letter from Alexander Hamilton... concerning the public conduct and character of John Adams, Esquire, President of the United States." Well well. "His disgusting egotism... his bitter animosity, his ungovernable temper... the unfortunate foibles of a vanity without bounds, and a jealousy capable of discoloring every object. His presidency has been a heterogeneous compound of right and wrong, of wisdom and error."
Stop it. I will not have you making fun of something that he can't control. I accept everyone for who they are. You two should take a cue from me. Really? Like those ladies in the stationery store?
Neither can your sister. I thought I made that clear. - Ashley, are you having sex? - I said she wasn't. Customers in your store heard I'm having sex?
I'm not sure he was. Then how did people find out? I don't know. I could be mistaken, but... I think your two best friends are a little chatty.
I don't know. I could be mistaken, but... I think your two best friends are a little chatty. No, they told me to my face that they didn't tell anyone. Don't criticize my friends.
I could be mistaken, but... I think your two best friends are a little chatty. No, they told me to my face that they didn't tell anyone. Don't criticize my friends. W-Why would they tell anyone?
Yes, I'm aware of the math. Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth. The issue remains. How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection? If you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
We've got fabric. It's not a lot, but it's a start. What the hell's Delko doing in a dump like this anyway? So you able to find the bullet that grazed my arm? You're looking at it.
Then we're stuck with the. 38 slug pulled outof our frat victim. What are those lines at the tip of the bullet? They don't look like striations to me. It's because they're not. When a bullet's in flight, the jacket heats up to around 400 degrees, which makes it malleab.
That's why I came to you now. Why me? There was this kid, when I was inside, killed a guy in his cell. Usually, no one cares if the animals eat each other. But this cop, he didn't look at it that way.
My guess? Sliced his upper gastrointestinal,bled into his esophagus. Any chance he tore himself on these branches coming through the mangroves? No. The wounds are clustered. Uniform.
The airline had a policy against pregnancy ? Pregnancy, marriage, being fat. Fares were regulated. The only way they could compete was with the stews they had. Girls Next Door at GWA, Girls Gone Wild at South Ocean.
What else? Tragic what happened to that girl. - I heard she was some skater. - You remember letting her - into the adult skate, Rick?
- I didn't... - You lied, Rick. You did see Missy again that night. Her friend Julie was high as a kite, thanks to you. So you made sure Missy stayed silent.
Put her jacket on you, took you home. Same jacket you kept all these years. Let your daughter wear it. Why is that, Julie? Tiffany found it in the attic.
Well, your mom wasn't wrong. The assailants got her bag, but they left her jean jacket, sneakers AND HER EMPTY CASSETTE TAPE. She made some kind of mix tape THE DAY she died. She was gonna be a big opera star, but she loved pop culture. Toughest funeral I ever went to.
I just couldn't admit to it at the time. You couldn't handle that she was more talented than you. Instead,I was cruel. And that was the last time I saw her. I went to Monty's studio that night to get my prints of Rita.
Hell,I was even going to make more money that way. What a sell: "queen of the lens.¡± Still got some of her old negatives,too. I never could bring myself to print them. Who else had access to that gun,Monty?
You were Monty's assistant. You had copies of all his keys. The strip club was a dangerous place. You took Monty's gun for protection. Oh,that gun.Yes,I had it.
Do I make you Nervous? It's ok, agent. I think We have everything We need to know. This is not a man who Can confront a woman On equal footing. He sneaks up on them. Gets them from behind. Blitz attacks.

What you're proposing is medically impossible. Not impossible. Unprecedented. Now,Wade said that Pearl made sex incredible. And you think it made an excess of nitric oxide in the blood?
More like an empty one, but... Do you believe in the afterlife? Heaven or ghosts? Both. What about stuff like reincarnation?
Who's a pretty baby? Until it gets what it wants, nay, deserves, this fist will not yield. It will not yield. - So who wants to play Scrabble? - Sure, whatever.


Oh,we're being watched. There's another one. Federal agents. We're coming in. Peekaboo.
Okay, so you'd be making money and promoting a company that supports something that you don't believe in? You know what, the truth is, we don't really make that much money. Those tampon figures were wildly exaggerated. Plus, we have a lot of gay clients at the gym. If we close down, those women will gain weight.
Oh,hi,Barb What did you do with all the black people I don't see color,Barb You don't see color because there is no color Now,what did you do with all the black people

I wanted to try them out, so I made you and the kids some grilled cheese. - Hope I didn't ruin your dinner plans. - No, I'll turn off the porch light. The delivery guy will never find the house. You are now the proud owner of place settings for 8, matching silverware, water and wine glasses.
Then I'll give it to him. - You? - He wants his money back, right? I'll say I took it from you. Dom...

Well, do not let us disturb you. - Here, will you take this? - Fanny. - Yes, Edward? This is a library, a place of refuge. Libraries should be full of dusty old books and nooks and corners and places to hide away in.
It's just a program for self-preservation. It can also be argued that your DNA... is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life is like a nodal point born in an overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species... relies upon genes to be its memory system. So man is an individual memory system only because of his intangible memory.
Yo, dude, you've awoken my soul! Wordy, this is the sru; you can't be watching "lady in waiting". It's a good movie, it's historical. I got four women in my house, all right? Anything that helps me get closer to shelly and my girls, I'm there.

"Obviously it failed or it would be in the papers." Well, no, they're not gonna say anything in the press but... behold ! Transported from there to here ! The molecules tend to shift during the... transmatter.... uh... advance. But they were transported in bar form.
You stop bleeding' all over him! And finish burning' that. You are losing control... just like he did. You lookin' for me? Two days ago, you sat there. You made me a promise. Told me Opie was safe.
As for your time as a guitarist, that was capped by your composition of the number one hit song, Dreams of Monica. A song you freely gave to your former bandmates when you left the group because you were dumped by the song's namesake. What's that got to do with...? Is this the kind of decision-making we can expect when you're representing our interests? I gave up the song because music is a living thing. Dreams of Monica was written about that girl, for those people.
Smoking may cause cancer but it didn't cause this particular cancer. It wasn't our cigarettes. Or it was genetic or asbestos or a paper mill. Never do they take responsibility, ever. And God forbid, if you sue them, they'll bury you and your lawyer. They might even depose your doctor to death.
There is no conscience at big tobacco. There is no conscience in Washington which has been bought and paid by this industry. Conscience has to come from you, the jury. If real regulation is to happen, it has to come from you. People are smoking day after day after day and dying and dying and dying. The tobacco companies keep getting richer and richer.
And how can any society tolerate it? But we do. There is no conscience at big tobacco. There is no conscience in Washington which has been bought and paid by this industry. Conscience has to come from you, the jury.
In the last few years, they've increased the amount of nicotine in the average cigarette by 11.6 percent to make them even more addictive. We learned tobacco companies have been adding an ammonia-based compound to cigarettes for years to increase absorption of nicotine. It's basically the same principle used in crack cocaine. And let's look at the obscene strategy they've employed here. Smoking may cause cancer but it didn't cause this particular cancer.
They put up brightly colored ads at kids' eye level in convenience stores. They hire gorgeous 20-somethings to frequent popular venues and seduce young adults into attending corporate-sponsored parties. Cockroaches will always find a way. They can't advertise on TV but they've hired PR agencies to hook them up with the film industry. It's worked. Researchers estimate that smoking in movies delivers nearly 400,000 new adolescent smokers every year.
And I'm sorry, but I don't give a damn what the case law says. The law... You simply cannot look a dying man in the eye and say: "You don't get the right to try to save yourself. " The law cannot possibly say that.
- The very kind of invasive legisla... - This does seem a bit cynical. You are basically wanting to marry Denny Crane to skirt tax laws. Your Honor, in this day and age, the preservation of wealth is paramount. And I'm sorry.
She broke prison rules to be with him. Hell, she kissed him! That's probably why they decided to make this a referendum on private prisons. Better target ¡®cause "for profit" translates to "greed and avarice," and we love taking the deep pockets down a notch, don't we? But, folks, private prisons are a good thing.
Very bad for the welfare of our citizenry, and if we go with this system that disincentivizes rehabilitation, then what? We've already got 2.2 million people in jail. In fact, many jails have to release criminals because there is simply no place to put them. Corners get cut, costs get shaved, officer training is short-changed, and suddenly we have children who are first-time offenders being physically attacked by corrections officers. Mr. Palmer claims his client observed industry standards, yet his client held himself up as being above those very standards.
- Why didn't you tell me? - You had to discover it for yourself. Like Dorothy and the ruby slippers. Exactly. I had a dream once I did Dorothy... and the lullaby league girls.
This man can make some serious noise in a courtroom, and let's face it, none of us wants to see a big flap here, do we? Prosecuting for adultery? Nobody does that, not even Texas. You certainly don't want to be doing that here, not with the polygamy thing going on. Polygamy is illegal in Utah, and not practiced by the majority—
I-I think that they would make amazing parents,even if they are democrats. speaking of which,can we tell you how much we enjoyed your tv show "red,white blue"? So what was it like,interviewing all those famous types? That's actually how we met. oh,how romantic.

Well, you can watch. I'll drink for all three of us. Come on. What was that moisturizer again? Kanebo sensal.
I'd rather starve than go without your night creme. We are coming out with a budget line, you know? Really? Well, you should advertise that in "Mode." I very much doubt the Del Rios budget customers are poring through the high-end pages of "Mode."
So, your Standards Chair informs me that you are planning to vote to expel her tonight. - We were, but I've been thinking... - Things could get messy? - Yes. - Well, I'm here to keep things clean.
The wave forms are so slow that the ear isn't picking it up, but the body is. And it's moving the body. Renegade Soundwave, they, I think... did a track called "Women respond to bass". and it's absolutely true. There's something very sexual about low, low bass. That sort of affects you down here. It's just a way you can feel it in your body. It's something, like, for a party, for a crowd, they just dance to it.
Just great. I wasn't there when it was born but I heard that King Tubby was the first who started dub music. And I sort of believe that because he was the one who mastered it. He was the best in dub music. In his time. Tubby was a wizard in electronics.
Oh, God. Did it not go through? What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps? - I love that bed. - Don't buy this act.

I have to present myself as a crown jewel, surrounded by other smaller, slightly flawed gems, but quality stones nonetheless. And try to round up a couple people who can vote so it doesn't feel like a total high school party. A party at the Hudson, huh? I got your message. Since when are you having a party?
Oh right. There may be stuff in here that you need. Here you go. Seriously? That's the best you guys can do? I have to say, I was pecting a little more now that you're seniors.
Of course. It's our tradition. Now I hope you don't mind, But I sat the girls from school in the second row. Well, since they are ur friends, why not?
My job, no thanks to you. Don't you have socks to darn? Blair, this is not about you or me. Go find Serena's name card and put it on the correct seat. Don't touch Serena's name card.

Well, don't be so hard on yourself. You were just a kid at the time. Yeah, well, I'm not a kid anymore. And I had this whole speech planned for Rose. I bet it was good. It was good. But instead, I let her watch porn and I called her a slut.
I know how it seems, but the truth is, I'm responsible for a lot of what's going on around here lately. Laurel does have the right to be mad at me, and I did overstep my boundaries. And the girls are smart! Meggie! No, no, no, I'm serious.
So, you're rescinding the offer? No, i just i don't want an answer. I don't want things to change between us. Yes. Great.
Jor-El knew he was sending you on an impossible odyssey... To be given the power of a god yet exist among humans. Sometimes i feel like i need to be two separate people. Either way, i can't keep expecting you to save me. Well, that was the last time.
I'm not usually confused when you say things like that. I'm ordering her cancer treatment to be continued. Why does it cost $2,300 to fix a coffee machine? Cancer stem cells are real. They explain everything.
Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know. What I do know is that you were not seeing what everyone else was seeing. And now? Things are gonna be... Beautiful?

Loyalty to the team? Fear of the unknown? Do you regret your decision not to go with her? It was beyond my control. Really?
No, but sometimes expiratory blood can actually mimic high-velocity gunshot spatter. It's on the back of the shoulder. It's probably not his. Maybe he's got the killer on his back. Before I left, uh, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.
May I make a personal observation? As a friend, not as a therapist? Everything I've told you, you could have read in a book. I think the case is a mere pretext and you're here for a more personal reason. Before I left, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.
Age of consent in Nevada is 16. No, have your lawyer look at the statute again. There's an exception when a person is in a position of authority with a teenager-- like "executive producer." Come on, let's go. Spermaceti. An oil found in the heads of sperm whales.

Good morning. Only the windshield is left. Hold the windshield. Mr. Hayati, I know it's a bit hasty, but believe me, it has already helped us a great deal. Don't worry, your automobile is under my guarantee.
Are you sick? No. For the Army. Have you ever had any poems published? Yes, in the Düslerjournal. At the bookstore...
Oh, my bad luck! Look over there, Anberber, that's my island. No one ever dares to go there. It's mine alone. Gashe Anberber, see this tree? It's the story of my life.
Dad! You have to help us! Maria, slow down. What's happened? We're at the Tycho Radio Telescope, near a village called Goblin's Copse. Sarah Jane's been captured by a Soltaran.
Tell me. Last year, some really weird stuff went down. I never got my head round it, but... some alien thing took Sarah Jane out of time completely, but Maria could still remember her because she had this box. It protects you against some other alien - little midget thing, the Graske. And, er, bad time things in general.
- But you don't live together anymore. Does that mean your relationship with Mom and Dad was unsuccessful? - I don't think it's the same. - I do. Sometimes you have to move on, whatever your feelings.
I'm going to look at my schedule. But we should probably start by meeting twice a week. No. I think I'm okay. Therapy can't be rushed.
There's no evidence that the body was disarticulated prior to being shoved down the chute, so she either went in headfirst or feetfirst. Given that, I've cut a hole that corresponds to the measurements of the chute. There's only one problem. Any way you turn it, the pelvis won't fit. So, the body couldn't have entered the shaft by that chute.
Make an honest woman of me. You have no idea, do you, quite how unromantic that is? - Piranha? This is most extraordinary. But I beg you, Miss Spencer, to entertain my explanation of it, for it will be truthful, if a little intractable to believe. There is a door, Miss Spencer, in the attic portion of my father's house, which is a place unvisited except by servants and myself.
- Oh, my God. - What? Is he okay? Logan got his orders. He's coming home. When?
Detective taylor, you know the whereabouts Of the three defendants? Aaaaa All three defendants were gunned down last night Around the same time at separate locations. If we weren't looking at three different shooters, I'd accuse you of trying to protect Your undefeated record. My case was rock solid.
No problem. - Are you getting sick? - No. I'm not getting sick. I don't have time to get sick.
The barrel is a metal tube you can buy In any hardware store. And it wasn't designed to fire a bullet. That explains the shallow penetration. No rifling inside the barrel. The bullet didn't spin out with increasing velocity.

Sustained. Let's keep the slang to a minimum, people. Plaintiff's lawyers claim that your decision not to grant him its marijuana constitutes a capricious and arbitrary decision. It's a security issue. Besides, two identical studies involving cannabis and MS were already approved and ongoing. We didn't see the need for a third one. So these other two studies, they were designed to test the efficacy of cannabis on juvenile onset MS?
And when those two things meet, they make a baby. How do the egg and the sperm meet? Well... Okay. Let's see.
I mean...it's all part of the same thing. I took a closer look at the casing and when went to remove the gsr,it was sticky. So I ran it through gcms,and get this: It wasn't gsr. It's thc. They used the casing as the bowel of a pipe.
Suggests the fragment was dragged across the floor. And I noticed that the feathering was on both sides of the fragment. The other part of the card was still in the house. We processed the scene,mac. We didn't find it.
Hey you know what I hate? When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold. And you like "Why didn't you warn me that`s so cold?" And he's like "It's ice cream, dude". And you like "Oh, man".
- My Lord this is ridiculous. I've never used magic. Does your son have any evidence to support this outrageous accusation? - Do you have evidence? - I do.
You have no idea how hard it is to keep this hidden. Well, you can continue to deny it, but I think Gwen's a very lucky woman. Gwen? It's our secret. This fish didn't come from the water, did it?
-Don't turn this around. Don't flip this. You got kidnapped by something that goes on a salad. -Hey, it's a little more complicated. -And by the way, by the way, I did not just leap a bunch of mushrooms. There were also these turtle-shelled things I had to jump over, and that was really hard.
I'm like, I ain't touching that thing. I've heard noises coming out of there. It's evil. I've seen you pull farm tools out of that. She shake her purse, nothing comes out.
You're in an apartment, that's a rat. The stockings Were hung by the chimney With care. And believe me, the room could use some fresh air. how did that tradition start? Hanging up dirty laundry hoping Santa Would fill them With goodies.
I just thought it would be useful to try a couple of times. The communication of ideas in verse leads spontaneously in a natural rhythm. Feel the beat of your diaspora... African scroll in your veins, Bebop from the blues to funk, the gospel... to the heart of your people. At that time traffic was not so 'terrible.
Peter, we talked about other things, not just the bathroom. What kind? His wife has ideas stunning. I do not ever be noticed, but I did Note that the kitchen and 'in the wrong place. E 'rintanata them' behind as an afterthought.
What are you building? It's a rocking chair, obviously. It's early yet. I like to build when I think. Think about what? Is there some problem you would like to talk about with your new imam?
Okay? You have to protect me. Because like most comedians, Sinbad is very angry on the inside. - Come on, come on. - You think he will autograph my shirt?
Anything for our little R-Lo. You don't think this stunt will help you in the election, do you? Oh, my little, um, pit bull, this will win the election for me. Because you got a few girls a date? No, because Evan did.
She could walk back in here and tell us exactly what happened. She would point at him and she would say, "He didn't do it!" Circumstantial evidence - what does that mean? That it's ambiguous, that it doesn't prove its point. What's ambiguous about these photographs?
So why are you still doing it? Because when I got out of the car... ..I saw shutters open at the Manor House. And anyway, the violence was telling me something. What? They've got something to hide. The story of Alison's disappearance transfixed the nation.
Hey,guys. What's going on? Oh,nothin'. What's goingn with you? I just talk a walk in the woods.
I mean, L.C. or whatever! They're coming up the stairs. Abort mission, abort mission! That was my first time speed dating, too. I was pretty nervous about it.
The enemy was too strong. By my fault? Or yours? You call that lead? Our bullets do not carry.
- Lambert can tell us a lot. - At dawn. I fear the fellow may prove elusive. See this cover? It's been hastily re-glued in a clumsy manner.
The kind of person who can take a couple of bullets and still put up a fight. The kind of person who hides something like that in the back of their watch. I just pray to God that you're on the right side. Sir, just got a hit within our search parameter. Combing the server for an IP.
I don't remember anything. Amnesia? I don't know. That kind of trauma to the head combined with the blood loss from the shoulder wound... it could cause memory loss, yeah. There was a computer upstairs.
- Taking a look. Who knows what it's like in here now? Everything's fine. Let's go. Send someone to get Gavin's body.
Do you think Abby knew what he was going to do? Until I know the truth, I'm holding them all responsible. They were seen an hour ago heading into the city. I will not allow murder to go unpunished. I used to love this place.
Yes! Anything else? I want some Cheetos. Sodas and Cheetos, yes! I'll be right back.
Anything else? I want some Cheetos. Sodas and Cheetos, yes! I'll be right back. Where'd it go?
- Yeah, what a dick. (I fucking hate Craig! ) - Sir, we have a problem. - What now?
Sure, most men would never invite a man back into their lives who'd stolen three of their fiancees and undermines him at every turn. But you have such a big heart. You're so loving and kind that you believe the best in people. That's what I love about you, Phil. That and the sex.
Interesting. - What's interesting? - 'Cause we're truth-telling. What? Nothing.
It was either the army or prison in buffalo. - Can you shut down the web site? - Yeah. I'll shut it down. They left a backdoor open, and i'm in their code right now, planting bombs and viruses and generally raising hell, sir.
- GOD I saw a tree with human bones hanging like adornments. The meal is scarce. Some persons do the unthinkable thing. I am afraid, Adam.
- Later. The effects last longer... not just the usual two months. These lines here... just here on the forehead... - make you look older. - You don't want to have a bad-tempered look, do you? This treatment is totally painless.
In a world where 1% of the population owns 40% of the planets wealth. In a world where 34.000 children die every single day from poverty and preventable diseases, and, where 50% of the world's population lives on less than 2 dollars a day... One thing is clear. Something is very wrong. And, whether we are aware of it or not, the lifeblood of all of our established institutions, and thus society itself, is money.
which means basically that they got to sell off their resources, including many of their social services, their utility companies, their school systems sometimes, their penal systems, their insurance systems, to foreign corporations. So it's a double - triple - quadruple whammy! The precedent for economic hit men really began back in the early 50's when the democratically elected Mossadegh who was elected in Iran... He was considered to be the hope for democracy in the middle east and around the world. He was in Time-Magazine's "Man of the year".
Goverments try to perpetuate that which keeps them in power. People are not elected to political office to change things. They are put there, to keep things the way they are. So you see, the bases of corruption is in our society. Let me make it clear.
Our obligation to survive and flourish is owed not just to ourselves but also to that cosmos ancient and vast from which we spring. We are one species. We are star stuff harvesting star light. - Carl Sagan - 1934-1996 It's time to claim the unity our outmoded social systems have broken apart, and work together to create a sustainable, global society, where everyone is taken care of and everyone is truly free.
However, the fact is: The complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask. Designed to conceal one of the most socially paralyzing structures, humanity has ever endured. None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - 1749-1832 A number of years ago, the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve, produced a document entitled "Modern Money Mechanics".
From political institutions, legal institutions, religious institutions. To institutions of social class, familiar values, and occupational specialization. It is obvious, the profound influence these traditionalized structures have in shaping our understandings and perspectives. Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into, directed by and conditioned upon, there seems to be no system as taken for granted, and misunderstood, as the monetary system. Taking on nearly religious proportions, the established monetary institution exists as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is.
This publication detailed the institutionalized practice of money creation as utilized by the Federal Reserve and the web of global commercial banks it supports. On the opening page the document states its objective. "The purpose of this booklet is to describe the basic process of money creation in a 'fractional reserve' banking system." It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process through various banking terminology. A translation of which goes something like this:
On the opening page the document states its objective. "The purpose of this booklet is to describe the basic process of money creation in a 'fractional reserve' banking system." It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process through various banking terminology. A translation of which goes something like this: The United States government decides it needs some money.
A lawful consideration must exist and be tendered to support the Note. The Jury found that there was no lawful consideration and I agree. He also poetically added, "Only God can create something of value out of nothing". And, upon this revelation the court rejected the bank's claim for foreclosure and Daly kept his home. The implications of this court decision are immense.
The other is by debt. - John Adams - 1735-1826 We, economic hit men, really have been the ones responsible for creating this first truly global empire and we work many different ways. But perhaps the most common is that we will identify a country that has resources our corporations covet, like oil, and then, arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or one of it's sister organizations. But the money never actually goes to the country.
The country behind this propaganda is the US" - Pierre-Henri Bunel - Former French Military Intelligence In 2007, the Department of Defense received 161.8 billion dollars for the so-called global war on terrorism. According to the national counter-terrorism center, in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed internationally due to supposed terrorist acts. Of that number, 70 were American.
According to the national counter-terrorism center, in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed internationally due to supposed terrorist acts. Of that number, 70 were American. Using this number as a general average, which is extremely generous, it is interesting to note that twice as many people die from peanut allergies a year than from terrorist acts. Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America is coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year. And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for research on this issue was about three billion dollars.
On a more subtle level, when Walmart moves into a small town and forces small businesses to shut down for they are unable to compete, a grey area emerges. For what exactly is Walmart doing wrong? Why should they care about the Mom and Pop organizations they destroy? Yet even more subtly, when a person get's fired from their job, because a new machine has been created, which can do the work for less money, people tend to just accept that as "the way it is", not seen the inherent corrupt inhumanity of such an action.
The questioning is not availability but the technology to harnesst it. And there are many advanced mediums today which could accomplish just that, if they were not hindered by the need to compete for market share with the established energy power structures. Then there's wind energy. Wind energy has long been denounced as weak and, due to being location driven, impractical. This is simply not true.
- I'm going to make hotdogs. Testico said go home and do what we normally do. Well on Thursdays we normally eat hotdogs. Wait a minute! Do what we normally do that's it
Back home, we use this energy for light and heat But up close, there's nothing comforting about the Sun. Its electrical and magnetic forces erupt in giant molten gas loops. Some are larger than a dozen Earths More powerful than 10 million volcanoes.
But up close, there's nothing comforting about the Sun. Its electrical and magnetic forces erupt in giant molten gas loops. Some are larger than a dozen Earths More powerful than 10 million volcanoes. And when they burst through they expose cooler layers below making sunspots.
They seem to be forming a vast stellar sculpture. Nature is more than a scientist, an engineer it's an artist on the grandest of scales And this is a masterpiece Stars are born, grow up, and then, then what? Do they die?
A kind of vast, dirty snowball, covered in grimy tar Tiny grains of what looks like organic material preserved on ice, since who knows when maybe even the beginning of the solar system. Say a comet like this crashed into the young Earth billions of years ago. Maybe it delivered organic material and water the raw ingredients of life It may even have sown the seeds of life on Earth that evolved into you and me
The only thing between us and the possibility of alien life this layer of ice. But until we send a spacecraft to drill here Europa's secrets will remain beyond reach It's captivated our imaginations, haunted our dreams And here it is, spinning before our eyes Saturn. Named for the Roman god who reigned over an golden age of peace and harmony
But the Venus Express space probe is setting off alarms It's telling us, these dazzling clouds, they're made of deadly sulfuric acid The atmosphere is choking with carbon dioxide Never expected this Venus is one angry goddess. The air is noxious, the pressure unbearable.
And when they burst through they expose cooler layers below making sunspots. A fraction cooler than their surrounding, sunspots look black but they're hotter than anything on Earth. And massive up to 20 times the size of Earth. But one day, all this will stop The Sun's fuel will be spent.
Now, it wouldn't be enough since they've lowered our wages. Oh yeah, trying to get paid! That was funny. People would stand in a long line from the street to the reserve. There were arm ed security guards so we wouldn't fight.
- This June's revised regulations... Commissioner Akagi was an user? You're slacking off on the investigation! Just how many manufacturers can make criminal robots? I visited the various companies, but they all deny that their robots can be criminal.
The First Law has priority so it cannot obey such orders. It seems they stop functioning in such situations. But these crimes are actually occurring, so one of the manufacturers is lying. What does CSI say? There were machine parts at the scene but we can't tell who manufactured them.
Let's go. I consider you a lucky man, Woodrow. You'd probably be long married before I am. You'll never be married unless you give up on Clara. She don't mean to marry you, and that's that.
I've been out there before, and I didn't starve. Here, now, men, I won't send you out chasing a phantom in country this spare. We'll post a double guard tonight. Let's move. That horse might be a witch.
You should make a song about me. I have just stolen the greatest horse in the world. If Scull catches up with us, we should be singing our death songs. No Comanche has ever stolen such a horse. Yes, but now let's go a long way.
Thanks, Ma. If I was taller, I bet I could reach up and touch the moon. If you was taller, maybe you could. Jake says there's a man that lives in the moonbeams. How'd he get up there?
Return Post-haste, and have something formal to report. Don't make the Queen wait. Roger that. Integra... The joy of war... did you feel it?
It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsments. Our campaign has not hatched in the halls of Washington,
Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, "We are not enemies but friends.

This is the rustling nail. For those who swing a hammer I made this six-pronged nail. They'll never miss another nail head. One day, it dawns on me to craft a sunrise opener. And I throw myself into it just on and on.
But any move we make will be made with the group as a whole. Ramón, your books are soaked. Put them on those rocks to dry. Arturo. Water got in the radio, everything is rusted.
Braulio just looks at him. He served us the hot dogs without another word. I made a mistake and took the wrong flight. You didn't make a mistake, you discovered something. What did we discover?
You have the Bates 1000. Oh, that's great! Fuck, man, wow! Maybe you should talk to a homeless woman outside 'cause maybe she'll be impressed. Those things are barbaric.
I mean, this Azmenistani, uh, sloppy ground thing is all well and good, right? But it's a million miles away. Nobody gives a fuck about it. The more important news story right now is Cockpuncher mania. It's sweeping the nation.
Our military operations are purely in response to your violation of the treaty. - You are the one to violate the peace treaty! - We? Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. Guys, chill, chill. Let's take a chill pill here.
Come, Maria. Every Merryweather rides. It's in the blood. This is Peririco... she's a little feisty but she's a loyal stead. Just hold out your hand.
All right. Very well. Keep going. Keep going. Oh, my God.
The harbingers of death. The unstoppable tide. Howdy Doody. Your Highness, if you hand the crown piece over to us... No.
They're so cultured. I never met Negro women like them before. - Just us dumb ignorant ones. - That's not what I'm sayin'. Guess I never met Negro women like them neither.
You want me to help you make a 7 UP cake? Hold that. - It's purple. - Yeah. When the weather turns hot, the flowers, they start to dry up.
Hey, listen to me. Keep your big fucking mouth shut and don't worry about it. - So you're a welder, huh? - That I am, AWS certified. Can you weld plates watertight?
Not on the phone I didn't. I wasn't absolutely positive whom I was speaking to. That's how they find out if you're home so they can come in and rape you. I understand. Can't be too careful.
I've got the dogs. And I've started a boarding kennel. Anyway, if there's a break-in, I don't see how two people are better than one. Very philosophical. And I have a rifle.
Lucy there's no shame in being the object of a crime. Are you trying to remind me of something? Remind you of what? Of what women undergo at the hands of men? Nothing could be further from my thoughts.
Good for you. Yeah, I realize that breaking necks is easy but uh.. I'm sitting there and i'm stairing at myself in the mirror and I thought... This is tough. ha ha ha Why do you always laugh? Picturing you look at the mirror scares the shit out of me.
Diego could easily be the hero from my first film DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL? and the Sarajevan suburb of Gorica could easily become Fiorito of Buenos Aires. It wouldn't be hard to imagine Diego in WHEN FATHER WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS, playing the father, who atones for his adultery in prison during politically turbulent times. And nothing would be easier than to see the footballing magician acting in BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT as the man who is his own worst enemy, doing everything to his own detriment. This chapel is a creation of the members of the Church of Maradona.
As part of my pay I was given a place for my family to live. And I thought I could forget what I'd done to get it. Some things you can't bury deep enough. Hey! What are you doing?
What did you do with it? I lost it. Oh, not to worry. What a clear night. You can actually see the stars.
I asked him to come. To help me make up my mind. That's good to have family like that. You close to your family, Mr. Schwartzwalder? I have a wife and two daughters.
Stockfleth will therefore be replaced by a new pastor. That went well! Those who imprisoned our men without convicting them, could now themselves be convicted. So this trial was important. Not in order to have us convicted, but so they themselves could avoid being convicted.
As you well know, such movements are most harmful. Not just to the church, but to the congregation itself. Let us remember why I came here. I promise that your men soon will stand trial. They will be treated like any other citizen.
No, Pop. –And saved us a fucking mess. Come on. What good would it have done? Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus. We'll take care of him.
You guys into sweet jams? When are you gonna straighten up and fly right? - Saturday, about 10:00 a.m. - Ham! I made these radios for the voyage.
1,600 crunches a day... 500 push-ups with each arm- All that training for what? I can't go. - What? - I know we didn't build the probe.
And I don't know why the infection is moving so slowly, but I can feel it. I can feel the malevolence. I'll die here like the pharaohs with my legacy, a beautiful weapon... beautiful weapon. What was this virus supposed to do? It was designed to paralyze enemy troops by shutting down their neural system for 6 to 7 hours.

Look there. Do you see that one thread that missed the weave and lies on top of the others? - Like a mistake? - No, it's a code. If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.
Don't get all uppity, okay? 'Cause I'm gonna let you know the brothers down at the pen, they rave about my sweet tea every Sunday at my Bible reading. It ain't the sweet tea. It's them short skirts you be wearing. I'm just doing my part, trying to be a good Christian.
Do you really think there could be peace? Do you? I mean, really? Two days ago, I didn't believe in the existence of talking animals or dwarves... or centaurs. Yet here you are in strength and numbers that we Telmarines could never have imagined.
Our overseas investments only stand at 30 hundred million US dollars. Won't that imply our country is lagging? Like that London Symphony or something. We can continue with it after the spur of economic development. The news agency is also advocating for the freedom of speech. They're always eyeing the rich to donate their political funds.
Horse tranquilizer. A horse tranquilizer? Where'd he get that? I sold it to him. You can't sell horse tranquilizers to a midget!
Welcome... You owe me one! Hi, have you eaten yet? Why did you get me into trouble? Pay me the frog...
Two classmates stood outside his room for a whole day. Begging him to forgive me. When I returned, I changed to wushu. Those two must have been really good friends. One of them was your mom. How's the fire going?
She and I have a life which doesn't include you and I want to keep it that way. So I'm asking you man-to-man. - Not to see her, call her, text her. - I'm not much of a texter. Somebody in your circle seems to have a gift for technology. - What do you mean?
I usually make a video of my sessions, so they can be judged by customers. In particular, if a trance whether hypnosis is used. I love a copy and they get a copy. I prefer the safe side. Okay, so you stand for your home, tell me what you see.
Look at Tommy Trigger Finger. You want the blood and the guts. Well, it doesn't work that way. I can't just kick his ass. Physically, I can, but if you kick a bully's ass, then maybe you guys live till lunchtime. And then what?
Your talents really are wasted here, Dylan. We could have a drink if you like. After. - 'Course we could. - I'm not a bloody dog, Dylan. It's the brunette, isn't it?
Next thing I know, I'm here. -But they can't do that. -Are you kidding? All right, one more and then that's it. Everybody knows women are fragile.
All right, one more and then that's it. Everybody knows women are fragile. I mean, they're all emotions, no logic, there's nothing going on upstairs. Somebody! Help me!
I don't remember. I know you, but I don't remember your name. Mrs. Fox. Now, take your seat. I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat, the one assigned you.
Well, because they don't need me here. They need me in New York. They need him, Em. Will's the man. I can't believe you're letting him go. I mean, don't you know about New York girls?
Don't worry, Mom, I won't let you down. I'll keep this team alive. And our TV stations are complaining about all the fighting. Let's try to keep the fights in the tunnel or out in the parking lot. We have one more piece of business to go over.
This is history in the making. You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids and their grandkids and their grandkids. And when they look back in the annals of history... they're gonna be talkin' about three things... discovery of fire, invention of the submarine... and the Flint, Michigan Megabowl. Right, but still the game doesn't count. The trophy's 12 feet high.
There you are. You hiding? Yep. I've been learning. Stephen likes to talk about you. He tell you the cave story?
The trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat. So, I decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies, wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated. No. This was a story about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing. And even love the person she was trapped with.
Oh, great one, Lord would you please take these women from me and kill them? And why do you wish this? I have made this great journey. I have evolved. I have sacrificed all so that I may create with you a great peace.
- and death. Execute them all. This is a very simple ruling. People need to watch what they say. Admiral Enolo Phid, division chief, Fleet Intelligence voiced another concern from her headquarters at Terran Command.
-Okay. -Can you mail these out for her? -Sure thing. Thank you. You should totally mail me your number sometime. Okay. Just give it to me. I have a great memory. Where are my envelopes?
# You gotta hold the note till the end. # We're not the fortunate ones # # And girls just want to have fun # # Oh,girls just want to have fun # Come on,get up here.
# We're not the fortunate ones # # And girls just want to have fun # # Oh,girls just want to have fun # Come on,get up here. # Just wanna,they just wanna #
No,actually,I wouldn't do that if I were you. No,that... That's not... - It's horrible. - Not very good. It's a combination of papaya juice and coffee.
That's great. You know, I was swimming this morning with the dolphins in Costa Rica, and I realized something. I am a great man. And great men do great things. I want to open a flagship store right here in Philadelphia.
Now, we can also do something about the vaccine scar. I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much... Not with these ham hocks! Yes, well, once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you may change your mind about that. I wanna talk about this vaccine thing. I mean, can you counsel me on this?
I'm like, "Hold on. If you look at these pictures, "do you see a black guy anywhere in any of these pictures?" There would be no me, no no one else, no shock-the-world, no scandal, if there wasn't any photographs. It'd went away, it'd went underneath a rock, and that would have been the end of it.
To-to kidnap your kid? - Yes. - You're fucking nuts. If he calls and says yes, he's gonna take Tom to a river where they go and bathe. I know this place. Nobody goes there. And, you know, all you have to do is stay in your car a- and-and wait there.
Let her go. She's your daughter. Continue. Can I borrow your sweater? Do you want me to make a fire?
Yeah, I went in there and apparently you did, too. Good looking girl, huh? Weird about her though, don't you think? Being asleep all the time. Gotta be the perfect girl, though, don't you think?
The uncertainty that comes with being an adult. The memories of that night will come and go and fade with time, but you will never forget it. Just like you'll never forget tomorrow night. But hopefully that will be a memory that you'll always want to remember. So, tell me, what color is your dress?
I have studied them for some time. If we give them cause to fight, they will fight to the bitter end, but if we promise them a grand future, if we offer them our loving kindness, then I assure you, my friends, they'll fall for it completely. As you have done with your Jaffa? If by that you mean the Jaffa who, with the promise of freedom, managed to defeat the combined armies of the System Lords, yes. And that promise will be fulfilled.
There's hundreds of them, each sending real-time telemetry back to this computer through subspace. Exactly how does that add up to a time machine? They're looking for something specific. Solar flares. Exactly.
This white light, you haven't seen it on yourself yet, right? - No. - Good. That means if you're on the plane with us nothing will happen. I don't want to put Tracey in danger. Is it him or her?
- Here? The whole building. That's 12 apartments. Another three in a month's time. We rent you the studios and take care of the cops.
They've managed without me for 10 years. They can carry on. I've been turning tricks in rue Savin for 10 years. I have my regulars. They're calm. The neighbours never complain. - Then these girls try to take my spot.
- Definitely. We found it. You demonstrate great courage facing me in person, General. Courage is only required when facing that which you fear. The flames of ignorance burn without pain.
- Yes, keep them. Can I come in and play? No. Stop it... Thomas, your particulars didn't match the ones in the registry.
She looked up. I saw her face. She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot. That's not who she is. She's never going to jump in when you need her, man. So do federal, state and local officials have a plan in place for this type of catastrophe?
Since it will be my drama department next year. But you were so loyal. So sweet. That's called acting. You should try it sometime. Toodles.
Whatever. You wait for him. I'm going home. Jacob. Jacob! Jacob! What is the matter with you?
Open it anywhere you like. I do not intend to get involved... No no, please. Open it. A reading will do nothing but good. Genesis, 6:4.
- He wouldn't confirm that. He just says that the killings are sexual in nature. Write what you got. I'll run it by the 4:00, see if it takes. This indictment is the result of an 18-month investigation by the State's Attorney's office and the Baltimore Police Department.
You kill him, you kill the antidote. Oh, no, you lie. There is no antidote. None your pay grade allows. Oh, you're lying.
Tresckow. I'm glad you arrived safely. I hate to trouble you, but it seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff. You do still have the package? Oh, no, no, no.
Well, it might not make millions, but it just might save our lives. This'll do. - How do you know it's going to show? It'll show. I'm going to watch over the women here.
There's a hole in it. - Shut up. Now, what happened? I know you're gonna think I'm crazy. I just saw a disembodied dick in Angel's mouth.
The shooting star, the bright light, Ron acts weird, and his dick takes off running. - And killing. Yes, I haven't forgotten that. And killing. What if that shooting star was some alien life form... that invaded Ron and took control of his dick? - Ah, give me a fuckin' break.
Let me tell you something about this Katie Lloyd. She is going to be some lawyer. For her to be this good already, just out of law school, it's scary. How far women have come. They used to be objects we just wanted to have sex with.
–We would not be sending the message that— –Oh, yes, we would, Mr Shore. You make it permissible, that's one step closer to making it acceptable. And the real danger is that elderly parents start thinking it's maybe their duty to spare their children so they won't drain their finances. –This would not be that case. –It could be tomorrow's case. –Which is why we take it on a case by case basis, addressing all the concerns you raised.
But like it or not, babe, this is what you get, and— All of this is to say... I did a remarkably stupid, unforgivable thing... because I have fallen in love with you, and I am desperate for you to fall in love with me. Your honor, we're trying to build a world where we have fewer weapons as opposed to more. –Oh, that's simply not true. Bush tore up the arms control treaties. –I am not gonna get into a foreign policy debate.
It's not sexism. We believe in the plan of god. Men and women complement each other, and there by occupy different positions. Separate but equal? Spend a day with the nuns.
I know. I guess. I guess that the one true god just doesn't want him to live,right? anybody still hearing that frakkin' song? Nope.
I want to hear Admiral Atheist say that a miracle happened. You shot at her and you missed at close range. Doloxan fraks with your aim. So does doubt. I pulled the trigger and I'd do it again.
A tyrant craves power for its own sake. And all Laura wants is to save us all. Trust me. Better yet, trust yourself. Because that's what I'm really counting on.
Effectively, it creates a justice system that further and dangerously concentrates power into the hands of the executive. Namely, into your hands, Madam President. Far from being independent or impartial, it would actually damage the very idea of justice. Even the illusion of the idea of justice. ROSLIN: Thank you, Mr. Adama.
Actually, that's what I wanna talk to you about. Here. - I read the script. - Good. William loves it. That's why he greenlitet it based on my rewriting.

Did you see something? . I don't know. Please tell me this thing is not trying to trap us? . Tarkey that thing is not trying to trap us. What's this thing doing, stalking us? .
It's the cop. Sterling didn't check him. You think it's a king? . Yeah. That's some powerful motherfucker, man. It's the most powerful one I've seen yet.
Site of my bitter bliss. Oh, site full of pain and sorrow! Allow me to cry at my mother's grave and lift the burden off my heart. Way to go, Zorka, my love! He does not understand the affections of a young girl!
I will never see any of you again, any of you. Yes, you will, I promise. Nobody can promise anything any more! Darling... I love you with all my heart.
Where's my money? And somebody wrecked her car. I wrecked her car. You remember her face? 'Cause I don't.

Thank you for your service. Thanks again. Belt, shoes, laptop in a separate bin. All metal out of your pockets. Sir, your bag needs to go through.
How could you not see the emeralds? They were so beautiful! They were magnificent! Look, if you wanna see them again you're gonna come over here and help me move his goddamn arms. The trunk hit the ice just as it passed over the bridge.
Is that it? No explosion or turning into burning ash or... Nothing, no? Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed. I'm just glad she's dead. I can hold out for fireworks.
Just because of a murderer... He was... He killed 24 people... He considered himself an artist... He used to make scultpures of his victims' bodies.
The phone won't stop ringing. Everybody and their sister wants a favor. Actually, speaking of favors, I've been noticing all the recent forced overtime. Maybe we could hire a few extra nurses? Of course that's what you wanted.
And here... what do you see here? Do you feel threatened by something? No, these things never breach our world. They never touch us. Now, they may be anguished and run us out of a house by their presence.
You should go into politics. - Really? - Yes. But you need to improve grammar and go on a course in rhetoric. Masses are as a woman.
- Really? - Yes. But you need to improve grammar and go on a course in rhetoric. Masses are as a woman. You need to flatter them and offer them what they want.
No no. That's all right, Brian. Forget it. - Good night, Sheriff. - Night. Night. Mind the bedbugs don't bite.

Did you know, Garrick, I never rid a railroad track before? Why wait, Tunney? I'm sure you can catch a ride anywhere but here. And you are? I'm here to buy this church.
Root 2 News has received a video communique from the eco-feminists' unknown hideout. This is sub-commander L., den mother of the Feminista Revolutionary Collective, with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot. I know it's a little confusing.
Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside. Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning. How's that creepy crawler doing?
My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran. Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit? Make it so. It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space. Look! The asteroid.
We've got a problem. Nathan's made a power play against Danko. He's stirred up a hornet's nest. It's nice to know a mother still has some influence Over her son. Things will be better for us with Danko gone.
I know what it's like to have parents who are less than. My mother brought us here because she wants to start a new Company. She thinks it's the only way to keep this from happening again. But that first Company she started was corrupt. Yes, but why?
Other times secretly pleased they're turning into repeats of me. I'm fine. Really. Green is not the new black. Hasn't anyone else noticed that everyone has gone totally insane?
I took a risk in lying to her about her condition. I decided to test the only remedy I've come to have any faith in. Awareness of life. We made it. Until she finds out from some other doctor that she's perfectly healthy, she'll consider each day a miracle.
I think she likes you. What tells you that Mum? Here you go Mum. This is such a nice day. Who knows this?
Oh my God, oh my God! I'm sorry. You just startled me. I didn't know you were still home. I didn't see your car out front.
I just wanna sleep or throw up. This vacation's pretty bad timing. I feel like a prisoner of war on a death march. Well, prisoners had stuff like scurvy. Yeah, and we have Dad.
I know I'm going to die now. I suppose I've always known that. I just never knew when. And I'm okay with it. Really. I don't mind my disease killing me.
Will you breathe on me later? Having a child who is sick is a full-time occupation. Sure, we still enjoy the usual day-to-day happinesses of family life. Big house, great kids, beautiful wife. But beneath the exterior, there are cracks resentments alliances that threaten the very foundation of our lives as at any moment our whole world could come tumbling down.
How's it going in there, Mike? Yeah, there's nothing here but certificates of authenticity for paintings and artwork. It's gotta be here somewhere. When you're a spy, you spend a lot of time looking for people's hiding places. It's always good to start by searching where your target has the easiest access.
I've got dinner with a client. You let me know if you find something. A bug, in its simplest form, is just a microphone attached to a radio. Effective, but easy to detect with a frequency scanner. A more subtle device is the wireless key logger circuit.
These should do the trick. Life with a hypochondriac mother... gives you a useful knowledge of pharmaceuticals. Those are for pain? In low doses, pilocarpine cures dry mouth. I'll take 'em after you do.
You got armed guards at the only exit. You think I'm gonna fight my way out with a stapler? Water's ready. And look around for some towels. In an enclosed space, getting around a cell phone jammer... is a game of who's got the stronger signal.
Okay, listen to me. I've just learned that Juma's operatives are planning another attack. Jack, they're telling us here it's over. That's wrong. Tony's my source on the intel. Do you know what the target is?
They were ferried back to Starkwood approximately 90 minutes ago. 90 minutes ago Jonas was handing down his new strategy to the board. Stonewall the government, no cooperation whatsoever. I can't believe this is happening. Sir, this is happening and I promise you the weapons are on your base.
Hey. I'll assume that was necessary. Don't start with me. I'm not in the mood. All right.
Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner. Alpha One-- go ahead. Agent Walker, I'm at checkpoint Delta. I've got two agents dead, shot point-blank. Their vehicle is missing.
- Hold on. - What's wrong? - I've lost my feed. - Chloe's feed just went down. What'd you do?


You do not need a scarf. Then again who needs a scarf? Wrap some old jeans around your neck, that'll keep you warm. That's what your mother would do. You're right, she would.
We're close to him. Close to your husband? But part of me doesn't believe he's gone, and it's better for Jimmy. The spirit of his father is helpful to him. I took the caretaker's job just to be around him.
I don't know, man. It just hit me. You remember when we saw Doug's mattress impaled on that statue? - Yeah, we threw it out the window. - No, impossible. - You can't open windows in Vegas hotels.
I asked him to leave it here. Did you have it at the tree house? Friday was there when the smoke happened. What if he hasn't gone hunting? But his spear wasn't there when we left.
- What? It's no longer here, sir. Echelon is gone. Are you trying to tell me our multi-billion dollar program just got up and left? ! On its own? ! What the hell are you looking at?
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots. 9 cities in 9 days. Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way. The race continues. Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
Earhart, this is Itasca. Did you receive transmission? Subtitles: Arigon Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
If one of you guys can reach it, maybe you can dial 911. And, you say you never saw their faces? No, never. And what was the name of the lawn service ... that you normally use? Mountain View Lawns. I don't think it's those guys.
Come on, patty. Don't tell me you're not angry. I ever tell you how i choose a case? No. I used to not understand it. You know, why some cases grabbed me and others didn't? Then I realized... it starts with a seed of anger.
How long are you gonna let people keep calling you that? What the fuck is your problem? Look! There on the screen! Oh, sweet Jesus! I saw it.
Are you psyched? Are you psyched? Yes, I'm very psyched. - Did you shave your cock yet? - What? You gotta shave your cock.
Speak. One of our trucks saw them heading into Los Angeles. Los Angeles. Of course. Yeah, but the trail goes cold after that.
Dude, are we over-stoked to hear a voice from home. The Vision One will be departing for Earth in 15 minutes and 32 seconds. So head back to the spaceship before your oxygen is depleted and get ready for lunar lift off. Until we get the puppies home safely, we keep this quiet. OK? I mean, I need full confidentiality on this.
Come on. I don't need to do the triangle I need to get up there and... It's the second quarter and we have Manson Number 1 jamming for the Hurl Scouts. This is a rough contact sport. These girls are lean, mean skating machines.
I get it, but what was I supposed to... Was I supposed to ask for permission? I mean, you would have just said no. You're damn straight, we would have said no. What do you think, that the world thinks of those girls with all their tattoos?
And you know what? I worked my ass off to get it. Yeah, me, too. It's too bad you're only 17. What do you think the league is gonna say when they find that out?
There they are, the coaches shaking hands, being nice and diplomatic right before the craziest match that we will ever see here. Oh, I love it, Austin. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about the one and only Iron Maven versus the upstart from the heart of Texas, Babe Ruthless. Yes. Our jammers, Ruthless versus Maven head-to-head, the teams' two top stars.
You're a professional athlete with that limp? -Oh, Christ! -All right, look, I don't want to go back. Okay? I want to make a new life here in New York. You'll wind up a prostitute, like those Asian girls who come here full of high hopes.
"Bring me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses..." I'm surprised you know that, terrible as it is. I closed with it for the Miss Greenwood, Mississippi pageant. I think it's so moving. But the huddled masses were never welcomed with open arms.
-Boris, everybody dies. -It's unacceptable! Your panic attacks are getting more frequent and more intense. You have to go back on your medicine. I'm not going back on my goddamn medicine.
Right? Well, I was buying this shirt, if you must know. You like it? -It's okay. -Just okay?
No, ma'am. I admit we are interested in your story. But trust me, we are not reporters. Maybe he did something to Ally. And then, I suppose, got Madge to tell this story about an angel.
So what's his quirk? Psychopath. I'm going to kill him. You should be freaked out. Your luck is going to run out eventually.
I intend to see this through... Antivirus and all. Oh, my God... What happened? The inevitable, I'm afraid.
He's so strong! Kanna, I've got a gut feeling that we can trust him. He has white teeth, a straight nose and innocent eyes. We can give him a chance. I've never seen anything stranger...
Brenner. Mr. Brenner. Well? Well what? - The car.
Am I supposed to be following you on all of this? Oh, sorry. I get kind of wound up when I'm nervous. We're doing an in-house study on how crime scene evidence, specifically photos, are archived by both the state and local police departments... if there's anything we can do to improve that system, you know, keep the bad guys in prison. Which brings me back to my first question: Is there anything I can do for you this evening, Miss Crystal?
Oh, sorry. I get kind of wound up when I'm nervous. We're doing an in-house study on how crime scene evidence, specifically photos, are archived by both the state and local police departments... if there's anything we can do to improve that system, you know, keep the bad guys in prison. Which brings me back to my first question: Is there anything I can do for you this evening, Miss Crystal? Yes. Would you please show me how and where the digital images are downloaded from the photographers' CF cards? How safe are they?
He's Allen. Sorry, Dell. Can you open this photograph right here? All right, here's what I'm looking for. You see this cigarette right here?
He's gone. He's in the closet. Move. Coming through. Move. Okay, you got us. Yeah, worst plan ever. But I know about the tattoo.
That's it. Take it easy, brother. It ain't her fault. Sorry, sister, we all just a little uptight. But if you bring us some of them good-ass waffles everything will be all right. Man, you guys ain't had no waffles like these.
Now Kramer, Kramer gets a pass from me 'cause Kramer's my nigger. Well, very forgiving of you. Look, as a friend, man, let me tell you something. You're not funny. I think I'm funny.
How did you do that? How did I do that? There's this... Girls like famous guys. It's a story for them, I guess. I don't know.
I need to talk about it, man. I work for this guy now. I can't... I mean, that's all I'm... It's all I'm thinking about. I'm gonna tell you this story that makes me feel all right with death. When I was younger, my grandfather died and we were all gathered around him and there was this one candle next to his bed.
Oh. 50. 50? On a bad day. My man Tango. You always were smarter than the average motherfucker. But on the strength, though, I just wanna say thank you, man.
Does your hair blow in the wind? ls it cuter than the other girls at school? Really? Sometimes their hair be hanging down longer than mine. The other girls at school got perms, too?
You the headliner? Yep. They just my openers. Can you tell us about this year's competition and what you have planned? Basically, I have planned a bar scene called the "Aqua Bar."
If you see some black women, just run the other way. Okay. Now, there seems to be a great demand for the hair all over the world. Can the temple satisfy all the demand, or do people find other ways to get the hair? So let me get this straight.
And this is your first shop? Will you make it through the day with that? How long before all that hair is gone? It could be gone in a few hours. A few hours?
Will you make it through the day with that? How long before all that hair is gone? It could be gone in a few hours. A few hours? Once the ladies get it, they want more.
Who cares? Not one piece of research have gone on in America, while we have gone to the moon and walked on the moon, when our scientists have not even walked on a black woman's head. Natural hair is freedom. Black women, yes, we are high-maintenance. But with us, you get so much.
'Cause people with that soft, natural, curly hair, I call that bad hair now. Okay, 'cause it's hard to curl? 'Cause nappy hair holds curls. Tanya's new to this, but she's also business partners with former Bronner Brothers champion Kevin Kirk. Kevin won twenty grand back in 2005, when twenty grand really meant something.
A lot. Then they'll be following you. They'll be coming here. Son of a bitch! They're on their way.
No, Mia focuses on the girls. I focus more on distributors and the span of customers. And what have you found? I have found several prominent customers. Amongst them someone from the Justice Department, who participated in shaping the new sex market legislation. Three police men, one from vice, one from S€K. Five solicitors one judge and one prosecutor
I don't do things unofficially. Get a warrant. A place of safety, of untroubled certainty, of purity. This is the world we must maintain. It is imperative that nothing disturb the innocence of life here.
"We" are not going to do anything. You are not a part of this, not anymore. Oh, great. It is true. Below us is a cache of weapons Brother Seth and I have hidden there in the event that this day should ever come.
What do they need babies for? Rossum. - No! - I don't think she wants the shot. I'm not on drugs!
Put the ankle bracelet on me Since you couldn't put it on dad! I'll call you guys at the hotel in the morning. Good night. I'm sorry. For? You have to understand who my parents are.
The golden one his father gave him, and a silver bowl he kept on his desk. The sick friend you visited, - does she live near a marsh? - No, a meadow. Why?
And I'm really more of a sorcerer-in-training, anyway. I've been studying magic books my whole life, I've learned a few minor tricks, things you can do with powders and potions. - You don't have any powers? - That doesn't mean I can't help you. My knowledge in the field is quite extensive.
There's nothing you could've done to prevent this. Kahlan,what's going on? We're going to need Kreeg root for the ritual. Will someone tell me what's happening here? Male Confessors can't be allowed to live.
Before you know it, we're going to have a teenager on our hands, so leave a message while you can still get through. Oh my God, what happened? Shhh. Okay, shhh. Jonesy? Shhh. Baby, you just ate. I know, honey. Mommy's thirsty too.

We're looking for a ring. It probably came in last night. Do I know you from somewhere? He's a white guy with a tattoo on his neck. - Probably thought it was— - Real valuable, yeah. At first glance, it does.
But now my client wants probation. - What? - Sir, - there's a murder at large. - Then you'd better hurry. You are an officer of the court and therefore obligated to aid...
Do I... do I get my deal? You have anything to say, mr. Stroh? I guess I'd have to say he's crazy. I mean, he sounded so convincing. He almost had me believing him, but... Come on, let's be honest. That story is absurd.

Indian civilization wouldn't have lasted 10,000 years if it hadn't recognized the worth of what is literally the beginning of dirt, living dirt. Whenever interacting with nature, you've got to grow food for humanity and, at the same time, you've got to grow food for nature. Hi, welcome to Cannard Farm. Plants get compounds from the air, and they get energy from the sun, and they use their biological systems to, to fix this stuff into the sugars. They use some of those sugars to put into their fruit for attraction, to spread their seeds with all us animals.
Hi, welcome to Cannard Farm. Plants get compounds from the air, and they get energy from the sun, and they use their biological systems to, to fix this stuff into the sugars. They use some of those sugars to put into their fruit for attraction, to spread their seeds with all us animals. About half of those sugars they secrete from their root systems and pump those sugars into the soil to feed the soil biology. Plants are absorbing moisture so there's a tide in the soil coming to the plant.
In traditional agriculture, the soil is the mother. She's the mother who gives, to whom you must give back. And to treat soil as the sacred mother is the best thing you could put in your relationship with the earth. In traditional agriculture, soil is recognized as the source of all fertility. The sacred cow is such a important part of sacred soil because as we feed the cows, the part of the plant that we cannot eat, they turn that into the real life of the soil, the cow dung.
collectively, if so many of us, we are doing the same thing, we would accomplish a lot. It really does start at home. Sometimes we can't change things on the grandest scale, but if you start to change yourself, and your friend starts it, and your friend starts it, pretty soon a lot of people are doing something different. The good news is that we don't need to start from scratch, we can learn a lot of valuable lessons from the wisdom of nature. Put on the skin a dress, a green dress, like trees, like vegetation.
He lets you know he's upset. The soil doesn't. But in reality, the soil does scream; Erosion means the soil is hurt. It's bleeding, It's in pain. We don't understand this. Because we don't know its language.
So we work to create opportunities'do tree planting, to work on creating parks. The presence of trees and open space actually has a positive impact on people's mental well-being. We're in the South Bronx, on top of the house that I live in and what we're standing on right now is the green roof that we planted about 7 months ago. A green roof is a sustainable building technique and it's really simply soil and living plants, but it has some really amazing properties, such as storm water management. It actually retains about between 70-95% of the water that falls on it. Energy conservation, it provides an insulating layer to the floor underneath it, they protect the roof from sun damage so they actually last up to five times longer than a traditional roof.
Where are you? Some rest stop in North Dakota. Declan totally hacked into our minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one. Your moms are lesbians.
Some rest stop in North Dakota. Declan totally hacked into our minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one. Your moms are lesbians. How could they not?

Warn them all you like. It won't stop them if they need a fix. Right. Were they all from London? None of them were from London. They were what we call "weekenders". They come up to London to do the business and then go back to Manchester or Sheffield or Leeds - wherever.
You must have some enemies out there! Oh, we don't need film. We've got the real thing right here. Tell me, you play a master -" "Jewel thief, yes. Yes, that's right, but not a very good one.

Booth found this in tall, dark and handsome's drawer. It's an RF proximity card. And that would be... Basically,it's a super fancy key card. You wave the card in front of the reader, it logs your info and the door opens.
The blood on the victim's jersey was all his own. The rib cage has been bruised. - It has? - Yes. See this vague pattern of bone bruising?
- Pull out. Pull out. Oh, I hope that's fish. You better go wait in the truck. What do you think there, Bones?
Look,good people,they leave marks on each other. The least we could do is let them fade away naturally,not, you know,scrape them off or paint over them with new marks. So,you're not a prude? Moi? Hey,I am a very fun and,uh... very sexy guy.
I know how that feels. The hardest part is going to be sleeping in that big bed without him. If you let me, I can be your Earl. Awesome! Sleepover!
It's the same with April and her cancer. I just want to stop them all going through the windshield. Does Oliver remind you of you? Yeah, neither of us... Neither of us knows how to be around our fathers.
Isn't it amazing how many people have cancer? And just, like, having conversations, doing sudoku. Did you see those two girls in the corner on the computer? They were shopping online... For underwear.
My mom drove us to brooklyn and there was old dr. Solomon, sitting behind his desk. He did some tests and he told me that... that I hadn't lost the baby because I wasn't ever pregnant. I told him about my f. s. h. level and he said that I probably never would be pregnant. And then he went on. He said that... He sees this kind of thing once a week: women like me... successful, no children, my age and older... who come in just convinced that they're pregnant.
Smell the roses. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. What would you have done if you were me? I've thought about that.
What the hell am I supposed to do with that? Are you going to say anything? Just that I think that now is the time to stop taking care of everybody else, Walter, and start reconnecting to yourself. Was this your plan all along? To break me down so that I'd become dependent on you? This would not have been my conscious choice for you any more than it was yours.
- Shit! Motherfucker! You moron! Jack, last time. What happened between you and Ivan?
And you like my pussy way more 'cause it's tighter and prettier. That's so poetic. You really know all about this stuff? All right, so this shows the horse's past performance. OK. And this indicates how much the horse has run.
I'll be glad to handle this bump in the road for your son. - Great. - Can I count on your vote next year? You got it. The power of the Internet is truly amazing.
He's exactly the way he was before the treatment. That's what I was afraid of. Well, here we are again. Indeed. This city has become quite familiar to me, almost a respite from daily life.
I didn't even see her when I got off the plane. What do you mean? The last time I got caught. These stewardesses... they're such cowards.
Yes and no. Take a look at this blood. It's coagulated uniformly along the edge. Which is more consistent with a primary bleed. Right, if it was a swipe, the blood density would lessen the farther along it went.
Shaw Plastics raised $50,000 for disadvantaged kids. It was a good cause. More like a good advertisement. Did Shaw Plastics pay you to cover that story? We do this kind of stuff all the time,Ma.
Captain Chandler would have wanted to get farther away from us. He must be somewhere else. Central America, then. - Can you be more specific? - No. Remember I told you I discovered an extra gene on the virus?
I may be seeing you soon, sweetheart. He's in. Gonna say a little prayer for him right now. I don't really believe in death. First rule of physics:
Well, Jane, my first priority if elected will be... What's the matter with this guy? Wait, wait, wait. Senator, you have 45 seconds. Senator?
The same suspect. Keep in mind... Vincent,that looks a lot like you. And he may use hats or other means to hide his appearance. This man has a type.
What if he's sincere? Then he's deeply ambivalent. He wants to stop,but like an alcoholic,he simply can't. When we see him driving,his point of view is elevated. I'd say he's driving a van or an suv.
You are a therapist. Ghost or no ghost, How... How am I supposed to confront Ned about this? First of all, I wouldn't confront anyone Until I was sure it was his. What? You had the banger sisters over here last night.
Come on! Move on! - Let's go! - Where are we going? Hey!
Ok. Well, please take time to eat. Yeah,I will. Ok. The girls that you saw tormenting Courtney...
So,I took a shortcut. I knew I wasn't supposed to be there. It was a slide area. But I had to find the token and get back to Lauren quickly. Then I heard the rumbling.
Sam! Melinda, you're safe. You...you came for me! Of course I did. Where are we?
That's horrible. Chew your food. That's what my mom always tells me. Look,I know you're all blissed out and reunited And you want to be with Jim and you guys just probably want to be together. Wait,why aren't you together? Eli,how can I help you?
She got everything she wanted. The only thing she was sick of is me. Look,I know that this is painful. But if you could just forgive... If you could just let go...
This is Drew. I'm Melinda, this is Delia. Hi. Welcome. I'm Emma. Anyways, Drew has some dolls.
Why did you even agree to take me in? Do you have any idea what I have done for this family? Because of you! The dolls are not in the same place they were before. Yep.
Wasn't she? Yes. And you never confronted him? - Or Mariska? - No.
Or in this case, many prints. Summer job? Yeah,telemarketing, sophomore year. It helps if you believe in the products. These are actually really good knives.
Carving the turkey came later. Yes,and half an hour after the pentagram was imprinted on his back. You know,I don't believe this is the work of satanists. Really? You been chatting with Abby,have you,Duck?
- Green. I'd say it's more of a Torrey pine. Basically, it's the same coloras this: the discoloration Ducky found in Thomas Jennings' duodenum. As for the finger, that's easy. Most fake gold is made out of copper, like this ring.
Something else is just going to take its place, right? What, did you think you were gonna save the world, Charlie? Not the whole world. Look, you know, we just got to fight the little battles. Even if there's no shot of winning the war?
I think you can do better. For instance? Today's FBI. There's no other way to access Baley from outside of Steel Cave? What about this cable right here?
Last January, more active duty soldiers in Iraq committed suicide than died in combat. Now, if Nelson's PTSD work could prevent a suicide, is that worth the lives of 500 rats? Other researchers who lost their animals last night were working on cures for HIV, malaria, coronary disease. And it doesn't only impact them. An attack like this would have a chilling effect on many researchers.
I predicted four invaders. I didn't account for a fifth man. Yeah. Sinclair. Fine. Get it to the lab, and we'll take it from there, okay?
I'll give you the name of my plastic surgeon. You give me what was in that case. What do you say, Malone-sy? You hand over the meaning of love, or it's Mauler's turn again. Why don't you invite Boulder, too? If I had known the three of you were working for Whitmore, I'd have had you all over for tea.
And, most importantly, without leaving a mess. It took an hour for someone to finally notice the body laying atop Susan Mayer's roof. It was less than 10 minutes later that the neighbors began arriving, each determined to get a look at the various paramedics and policemen who were all frantically trying to figure out exactly how to bring the body down. And it took two days for my friends to realize this tragedy had affected them... We're ready. Come on.
Now why would you want to do something stupid like that? My doc says I got a bum ticker. Have to take it easy from now on. Well, once I'm done fixing Mrs. Mayer's shingle, I'm on a plane to Waikiki. Well, this is very annoying.
- Just give me one year. That's not asking too much, is it? You made me a promise. You need to stick to it. Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing.
It took us three years to find the right candidate, and part of you being the right candidate is having a support system post-op. You cannot do this alone. The ethics board will not allow me to let you do it alone. You need your friends. You see that orchid?
You cannot do this alone. The ethics board will not allow me to let you do it alone. You need your friends. You see that orchid? To anyone who doesn't know orchids, it's dark and droopy and it's ugly, unless you know it.
betty, let me call you back, all right? but keep me posted. okay, bye. okay, bye. (beep) guess my photos aren't all that important in the big picture.
Look,it doesn't-- I'm sorry.I didn't mean to snap. Uh,w-would you show us to our table,please? Absolutely. daniel.
forget it. Just throw it out the window. I love connor. But... that's bird-er. Oh,the little monster has wings.
Okay, smart guy, next time you have to take a shit shit in your hand, and then wipe that shit with toilet paper. ...and then tell me that your hand is clean. - Okay, I see your point. - Exactly. Dude, I get that, okay.
At least they do not flatter their women to make them better. If women had more character, .. Men are larger and the human race less despised. ... -Supervisors went crazy.
One thing's for sure, Mom always wanted to be a mom. And I wouldn't want her. ...to be anything else. You scared me. I know why I don't know what I want to be when I grow up.
Never forget that it was Afro Samurai that made you what you are. He will live in hell on Earth, for what he's done to us. You will enjoy every second of excruciating agony that I'll inflict upon him. You'll watch as he bleeds from his very pores. Listen to the sound of his breaking bones. Smell his fear and his burning flesh.
Shirt and tie -- you must be turning heads left and right. I guess I've been too busy at work to notice. You know,with everything else going on... Any leads on that thing that took chloe? A night watchman and two ambulance drivers Were murdered the night of the ceremony.

I always say so much stupid. I think beautiful, but when it comes out of the mouth - - It becomes silly. I would say ... "Flower". But my mouth says "piss". I would say ... "beautiful".
Pick it up, Theo. It's heavy. Warm. Open to your mind to the stone. Feel its power.
Didn't like the atmosphere much. Earthchild and Thunderstorm, man. I haven't thought about them in years. Talk about boner fiders. Yeah.
This ends... here! How right you are, Robin Hood. It's a scratch. It's nothing. No, you should be careful.
This is a pawn shop receipt for an antique cameo and a diamond ring-- the only two items left missing. Our suspect is, what, 14 years old? He didn't pawn these things by himself. You sure you don't want to give this a shot? I'd prefer to watch you.
The question is,what are we having for dinner? This muscle has two heads and a shared,single point of insertion. Judging from size and weight, uh,we can rule out Biceps femoris. Biceps brachii,then. The tissue is clearly infected.
He would've done anything for that man I blame him This is Edward's fault Mrs Humphreys Did your husnd ever say anything about Amber Jones, talk about the murder? No - Did you know your husband had a gun?
The judge is going to allow the jury to... Hear about the gun as well as Humphreys' suicide confession Which means I'll be back on the stand Ray, you testified that congressman Griffin was the most likely suspect Which was true based on the evidence that we had at the time And now, we have new evidence
How long have you had that rash on your arm? I don't know, a couple days May I see if you have a fever? Just need to touch your neck I'm a doctor- it's okay
She was an addict. She killed herself. We talked to Haley's boyfriend. He told us about the stash of meth Haley was holding for him. It was hidden in her room.
What happened? What happened is a young girl died because of events that were set in motion long before she was ever born. It doesn't make it feel any better,does it? You know,Nick? Everyone keeps telling me what this job isn't.
So, what's the point? The point is that you didn't tell me that you were banging the dead guy. That had nothing to do with this. And you didn't tell me you emptied out your 401 and gave all the money to Danson. We checked his bank records.
Well,gentlemen,all of the physical evidence points to Dr. Shaw. Wendy found his touch DNA on the syringe that infected Tobin. And while you two were out playing Smokey and the Bandit,his girlfriend, who's also a nurse at the clinic,brought me something he was trying to get rid of: a salivary gland from a rabid bat. I think that's what he used to make the virus.
You are a really, really, really, really sexy chick, Little Orphan Annie. You okay? You know, I just wish that everything wasn't so explainable. T rust me. Everything's not.
She wanders. It's what she does. Most likely, she left that rock star, if he'd passed out drunk, and ran off to find another one. She's probably in Morocco. The Grateful Dead. Well, we're sorry for your loss, Mr. Wyatt.
It's my go-to ball. You'll get it back. Eventually. Please follow me, sir. Right this way. When did bowling become so serious?
- I won't do that. Oh, my god. What is it? It's a teratoma. It's a kind of tumor.
During AI-5, Brazilian citizens had no rights. Everything was forbidden. We were slaves to this awful Dictatorship we had in Brazil for a long time. It was probably the mostop pressive time of the Dictatorship, the hardest time. Things were said between lines, as a subtext. I remember very clearly because my dad was a politician. And especially because I saw him leave for exile.
We can do this! Hurry up! We did it! We made it! We...
Chipmunk--She's still got a crush on me. It's so cute. It's okay. Oh, damn it, Marc. I just got off the phone with the FBI. They really think the money is gone,
Paul, you know this. So what are the candles for? Candlelight. When I took out that deputy, it wasn't like a glitch. The skills, it was like a wave, just everything rushing over me.
The whales are taking out the crab fishermen reality show. It's like they know. They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them. Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day.
- No. - Well, I got the next best thing. Great safety report, Homer. No meltdowns all week. I'm making you my new executive assistant.
We can save a boy's life. This boy's life! Doesn't it concern you? Of course! I mean, the images aren't random.
Do something or do nothing? Here's a radical thought - let's stop the process! This isn't about solving crime or about keeping people alive. It's about your ego. The images aren't random.
Can we talk about something else? Well, did you--I mean, did you not like it? I liked it. Are you sure? Because your face is saying that you didn't Can you just drop it, please?

What? Organ transplants. The human brain. Well, half of one. But it's useless.
- What's your 20? Two blocks south of the Boyleston T-Stop. Boston P.D. is sending an entry unit. I'm sending them to your location. Keep going. Keep going and take the next left you see.
Two blocks south of the Boyleston T-Stop. Boston P.D. is sending an entry unit. I'm sending them to your location. Keep going. Keep going and take the next left you see. The human brain is a fascinating organ, but it's not static.
Step down slowly. Keep your hands where I can see them. You so much as twitch and you won't have a head left to re-freeze. Are they mine? Yep.
I know I can't put it right I hope you understand it was important to be certain I understand you won't speak to me But there is something I need to know. No one else can help
- That was amazing. - Okay. Good show, old boy. - Look at you. WOMAN: Hi. Great party. I think Ellie's got the same bow on today.
- What did you just call me? - Guys. What else? We checked Fink's cell phone records. He got a call at 9:19 p.m., an hour before he was killed, from a blocked cell phone number.
That kid has the best seat in the house. Damn, I gotta go cover the Warriors game. How about I come back here afterwards, we'll polish this thing off and I'll even buy you dinner? It'll be like a work date. James! Can I ask you a question about my body? Well, I see this ending well for me.
He never had time for any friends. What's wrong? Max told me that being alone at Christmas means that nobody loves you. She's burying her son, alone, on Christmas. - I think that's heartbreaking.
You okay? Yeah. Yeah. What the hell was that? Both of you move Both of you move... Toward the door and be careful. Pressure trigger.
Yeah. Yeah. What the hell was that? Both of you move Both of you move... Toward the door and be careful. Pressure trigger. After the weapon's done its job, The pressure is taken off the trigger, and it retracts.
More than $4 million... By today's standards. Right. And he hired different contractors... To complete the construction in stages. I mean, none of them were told... What the finished product would be. There was a lot of mystery and speculation... About what he was doing up there. I need an updated floor plan.
That's how these boys plan to win this. It doesn't look like much, but-- Here's the deal, ok? We're going to place that container of water near Harold's bomb. There's a large quantity of C-4 in the middle of the container, which we will then detonate, sending the water out at 72 million psi.
And... check this out. And this is? It's called a solar illumination gauge. This side is used to measure the sun's path. See those lines?
Hey, it's a message from home! "Start streaming this video." Oh, thank God! Some contact with the outside world. Hey, that's my room! Hey, Steve, remember how you said I couldn't go to Space Camp? Well, check it out, you smug little bastard.
This doesn't work, he's done. Yeah, well, so am I. Charlie call signs... This isn't just a test of trust, is it? Right. You're playing this game because you think that if this mission goes south, then you're not the only one to blame.
Who's the girl with her? Oh, what's her name? Roxanne? It's that asshole thigpen's daughter. Cassie was... Friends with wesley thigpen's daughter?
Um, i'll grab it. Hey, do you mind if i stay? But that's why i love you. Come on. Let's go get drunk.
Hey, do you mind if i stay? But that's why i love you. Come on. Let's go get drunk. Some truths may not be heard the way we hoped they would.
Can we see the video? File was e-mailed and then erased. Man, this guy's good. He routed the file through a zombie network. Computers and e-mail accounts that have already been hacked into.
How did you know about the lake? Oh, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. I have these visions... of the future. Um, sort of like memories of stuff that hasn't happened yet.
I wrote it with everything that I could remember, large and small. I know it's not much. It's the best I could do. Oh, she was an incredible woman. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss her terribly.
I look forward to your arrival. What? What is it? It's too quiet. It's a big change from all the fighting the last few days.
- Kenny, put your gun away. - Seth, do me a favor... Hey, get him out of here, will you? All of you, put your guns down. It's okay.
About this Obama, with change, look at the people he's put in to mastermind the economic recovery. Larry Summers. I love it! Every time they talk about Larry Summers, he's always brilliant. He's another brilliant one.
You know, all the different names, for this, you know, ubiquitous, you know, sub-S retraded credit default swap, blah, blah, blah, blah, OK. But they, they talked about them as though they knew what the hell they were. You got the money and you immediately said, "What items? What auction?" Now the Treasury just, just basically cut that out of the bill.
Formerly sovereign countries would now pay their taxes directly to the banking cartel. Hundreds of new carbon taxes, controlling every facet of human activity, would only be the beginning. Now, all the elite had to do was to sell the public on accepting the final phase of their takeover, and it's Obama's job to sucker the public in to standing down so the bankers agenda can move forward unhindered. Never before in US history has the media gotten behind a president like they are behind Obama. The press has pulled out all the stops, bestowing a crown of infallibility upon Obama as the savior of the people.
But worst of all, the executive order continued the practice of rendition, which the LA Times called, "secret abductions." They don't know. They think that he signed off immediately on closing Guantanamo, but he's allowing prisoners now to be taken to foreign countries and, and not knowing where they're sending them, and to be tortured in foreign countries. They don't know that they kept that provision in there. Obama is now continuing the practice of secret arrest, secret prisons, and most importantly, indefinite detention without trial.
Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice, it is the only way. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see. In truth, Obama is not simply continuing George W. Bush's policies, He is radically expanding them. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation.
- in his tiny little hand. - Your shrink sounds amazing. He's a genius. So, now, Tiny Pants can do whatever he wants to, because all I do is think about my commission with a smile on my face. The house feels empty.
Aurelia. Swarms like this are not accidental. These individuals all hatched together ... when the temperature and currents were just right. Their timing has ensured that they can make the most of feeding ... on a late summer plankton bloom. Jellyfish have no brain and no blood. But they do have eyespots ... that enable them to tell the difference between light and dark.
There are hunters here, too, like these nudibranchs or sea slugs. Their vibrant colours are a warning that they are toxic. There are over 3,000 species, many hunt just one specific prey. Some hunt each other. This emperor shrimp makes the most of the poisonous nature of its host.
Packed close together, no one anchovy stands out. By sensing and reacting to the movements of their immediate neighbours, thousands can move as one. For a predator, picking out an individual becomes nearly impossible. The shoal's unity is its strength. Yet each fish is acting from selfish motives.
They must also protect their developing young. These flying fish are searching for the one thing that will make this possible. In such a vast ocean it's not easy. They're in luck. A palm frond. It's a tiny island adrift in a huge ocean.
Although these dragons were well cared for by their father, now they must find their own way in the world. There are fish, however, which provide their young with a safe refuge for far longer. The south western Pacific. A convict fish and it's something of a marine architect. Underground it has created a labyrinth of tunnels.
There are fish, however, which provide their young with a safe refuge for far longer. The south western Pacific. A convict fish and it's something of a marine architect. Underground it has created a labyrinth of tunnels. This adult never ventures out of its burrow, what it eats is a mystery.
Tempers do flare when a bee gets confused ... and goes down another's burrow, but these are minor disagreements. The colony is peaceful at the moment, because every bee here is a female. It's the males that are the killers and they are all dead. Their story began two months earlier, before the appearance of the females. Male Dawson's bees.
But some insects fly huge distances. September, on the shores of Lake Erie, in southern Canada. A monarch butterfly is fuelling up on nectar. A chill gust of northerly air. It's time to leave.
European wood ants under attack from a hungry crow. They fire the sort of acid that gives nettles their sting. So, this is like one of us falling into a nettle patch. But the master of chemical warfare is the bombardier beetle. It can create a chemical reaction within its body so violent ... that boiling caustic liquid explodes out of its abdomen.
They feed the grass to the fungus and the fungus thrives. The ants cultivate dozens of these fungus gardens throughout the colony. This is what they eat. The system is so efficient ... that a single colony can have five million members. But the fungus is also dangerous.
The forest might appear to be the perfect place for plants to thrive. Yet down here on the forest floor is one of the hardest places imaginable for a young plant to begin its life. The canopy above is so thick that only a little sunlight can filter through. For this sapling, too little light means death. But plants on the forest floor need not be passive.
For this sapling, too little light means death. But plants on the forest floor need not be passive. If the light won't come to them, they can go to the light. But they still have a problem. The light is 50 metres above them.
Now half of the world's population depends on it. But there is one other grass that has spread even further across the planet due to its relationship with humans, wheat. It underpinned the development of Western civilisation. Today, it covers more of the land than any other kind of plant. Plants have been residents on land longer than animals and have had nearly half a billion years to evolve.
This fly has to tread carefully. If it strikes one hair, it can carry on feeding but a timer has been set. A second strike in less than 20 seconds and the fly is doomed. An electrical impulse is triggered and the leaf snaps shut in just a fraction of a second. The tips lock together like prison bars.
The monarchs search out milkweed plants, but they have something other than pollination on their minds. Rather than collect pollen, this female lays her eggs on the milkweed leaf. This is the only plant the caterpillars can eat. But the milkweed has a defence mechanism. As a caterpillar bites into a vein, a kind of latex swells out, engulfing it.
Here in Dominica, there's a plant that is so manipulative that it has enslaved its pollinator. The bright red structures of the heliconia are actually modified leaves. These are its flowers. They may be small, but they play a very important role, keeping nectar well-guarded at the very bottom of their long stems. The purple-throated Carib hummingbird, with its long, curved beak, is the only bird capable of reaching this energy-rich food.
They may be small, but they play a very important role, keeping nectar well-guarded at the very bottom of their long stems. The purple-throated Carib hummingbird, with its long, curved beak, is the only bird capable of reaching this energy-rich food. But cleverly, the heliconia rations the amount of nectar it produces to force the hummingbird into returning to the flower time and time again. Every time it makes a visit, it picks up more pollen on its beak and feathers. The hummingbird is like an addict.
What the hell is this place? It is not on the map! Damn. Is that a car? Wow. I bet we could sell it for around 10 grand.

Dima, turn off the nanocatalyst! It's up there! DRILLING INTERRUPTED If Kuptsov gets his hands on it, the city will be lost. The catalyser should be destroyed. How?
But just because we didn't kill his precious daughter Doesn't mean you can't do your niÃ§ger duty, So fucking do it! We're done here. I don't have to listen to any more of that shit. - You use the word "dream" a lot. - Yeah, I like that word.
I've never liked London. I found it too old-fashioned. It didn't suit me one bit. But the cabaret our gang went to on the weekends served good beer. but I liked him.
The Aztecs say they started from this place up in the north called Chicomoztoc. It was a cave, and inside that cave, it had seven different caverns, and there were said to be seven different tribes. And the Aztecs say they were part of the seven tribes that came from the seven chambers of Chicomoztoc. While Chicomoztoc was once thought to be a mythological place, some scholars believe archaeological evidence suggests that it really did exist, and is located at the site of the ancient pyramid complex known today as Teotihuacan. The place of seven caves, we think maybe that has actually been located archaeologically at the site of the main temple of Teotihuacan, called the Pyramid of the Sun, which sits just north of the Valley of Mexico.
Author and researcher David Wilcock visited his laboratory to see how electromagnetism creates an environment that allows mercury to levitate. - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Yes. The demonstration will utilize a conventional superconductor material in place of mercury due to its toxicity. What am I about to see here?
Are you crazy? OK, let's do it like this. See these two stones? If they hit the water at the same time, it means he still miss you. But if they don't, it means he doesn't miss you anymore. You can start finding a new boyfriend.
OK, let's do it like this. See these two stones? If they hit the water at the same time, it means he still miss you. But if they don't, it means he doesn't miss you anymore. You can start finding a new boyfriend. The stones are not the same size. How can they hit the ground at the same time?
July 20, 1969 we received a transmission from the Moon telling us: "The Eagle has landed." Today's landing, like that one, represents the realization of a dream that has long excited mankind's imagination. And this mission offers the possibility of a momentous discovery in the history of mankind: The existence of life elsewhere in the universe.
I'd be surprised if you weren't. Well, I don't understand. What happened? This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected. It is also a lie.
- It is, isn't it? But that's life, I suppose. You go along and then suddenly, poof! It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal.
Right. Okay! They say all foxes are slightly allergic to linoleum. But it's cool to the paw. Try it.
I still believe in us, even if nobody else does. I believe. I've always believed. Ben, we don't have much time. That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.
Look, we just came to find the Resistance. That's all. The Resistance? What a joke. Fighting those machines is impossible.
That's all. The Resistance? What a joke. Fighting those machines is impossible. We keep our heads down, they ignore us.
The Resistance? What a joke. Fighting those machines is impossible. We keep our heads down, they ignore us. You keep your heads down and they'll come for you eventually.

Oh, just great! Perfect! John Glenn goes around the world, he's a senator for life. I went across the fricking universe! I should be governor, minimum! But, no, I'm marooned here on this stupid rock!
Oh, I hate the rain. Raining rocks and dogs. Great! Space, a universe of mystery. Well, today, the mystery will be unveiled.
You might even say, very alien! Excuse me! General! He does go to the high school. Glar's just trying to say the aliens might be friendly. Lem! Lem, you know astronomy.
- Attention, all personnel. - What's the matter? Why did he do it? I was gonna teach him to beg and everything. Amazing!
- What's the matter? Why did he do it? I was gonna teach him to beg and everything. Amazing! The alien's brain is so powerful, it's controlling them even now.
Let me see your ticket. - What time you got? - 10:55. The ticket office said that there was a bus going to Las Vegas, Bay 3, at 11:00. Well, now, all we know for sure is that your watch ain't being completely honest with you.
No. No. Emily. Emily. We need to learn healthier ways of resolving conflict, Emily.
He is not ready. I will see Reagan. I will try to convince to renounce this project, but... he will go after especially today. Because it has been well known we have no way we can monitor them. The country is in a critical situation particularly dangerous, Comrade General
It seems the real world is upon us tonight. I'm familiar with Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings. La purga is a dark stain on this Church's history. I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us. Comandante, have you begun the search for this explosive device?
On that pulley. This bench! I'm a cop. My son God answers all prayers but sometimes his answer is no. The college will not break conclave.
Somebody help! Help! Somebody Cardinal Baggia? Cardinal Baggia. Where was he hiding you?
-No, you said "hamburger." -Hamburger? -Hamburger. How did you know that we were being recorded? Easy, Inspector.
I'm not gonna continue this if you don't listen to me. Good... and evil. Have nothing to do with therapy. You know how many innocent women were killed in the sixteenth century alone just for being women? I'm sure you do... Many.
Don't fight it. Just ... Turn green. No matter what happens you were there. You did it. Let fear come, if it likes. Remember.

I know, it's my favorite part. He's so cute. How'd the dork do in the school play? Okay. Collins, do you know Big Mike from school?
I'm trying! What did I fucking tell you, man? Fuck! Fuck this. Imagine you're hanging from a rope. One minute, rock climbing, the next minute, staring at certain death.

- I'm going to a party tonight. - What fucking party man? Remember that girl the other night. What do you do with these high school girls? First, girls secondary are very hot.
When did you first notice that barrel? About four or three weeks back. See anyone else out there on that levee? Yeah, about a month ago in the evening, I seen a dark-colored car.
Why the hell are y'all here? We're here because of you, Mr. Doucet. We've been checking all the unsolved murders of females in areas surrounding highways during the time you were working for the state police. Rosie, I think we just found the knife that he used on Cherry LeBlanc. That knife wasn't there.
I'll have that afterwards. So, he asked if he could stay and I said all right, but I wasnt promising anything. I didn't want him to think I was easy. Anyway, he turned up with a suitcase and moved in. Last night, on TV, I saw he'd been arrested in a drug bust. He's one of the biggest drug traffickers in the country. What?
You heard it breathe. You heard it laugh. You became one with the tree. You even fooled the bird. The second test was harder, for you had to gain the acceptance of the mineral world. Once more, patience was the mother of wisdom.
Just right. You scared me! Could you move to one side a little? You're in the line of fire. This tree is 200 years old. It saw your grandfather come into the world.
What's he laughing at? I got something on my face? Let's see... you got a big horn right in the middle of your forehead. Idiots! I never thought so much was going on right under the house.
Sarah Wayne? And her daughter? Dear God, Pam, enough with the gossip. Anything else for you? No, this is it.
-No, something is wrong. -You must talk to Ralph Parker. You know, I've been dreaming about you. We were kids. You had a large red and green parrot.
We walked around among the trees and tried to catch it- -But all the time it was too high up, so we could never catch it. You know something? We actually had a parrot. It was red and orange and light green on the belly.
So anyway, here we are. And that's the story. So who's bullshitting who? Europeans used to ship their manure in dry form. Stowing the bundles below deck.
- I changed the course of human history when I invented surrogates. Now I'm going to change it back. You can't change what's been done. You and I know that better than most people. My son's death will not have been in vain.
Women? They can't stay mad. They are emotionally resilient creatures, man. Impressive. They're all fucking crazy!
No, you'll just have to buckle down and... what's your phrase? keep buggering on. That's right, sir... KBO. Of course the loss of Singapore came as a dreadful shock.
Practical thing would be to put him in a nursing home. This is home to him. And he knows he's here. I think as long as he does, we should hire nurses and let him stay at home. The farm has to go.
No, this is about you caring about someone then, all of a sudden no warning, you don't care about him and you're out the door. - This is not about us, Milo. - Bobby. Bobby walked you down the aisle. I know. I will be heartbroken. But I am not gonna stand around with my head in the sand.
If you're a foot fetishist, you write about feet. If you're a stock-market freak, you can write about the rising sales-curve erections of the Standard Oil chart. When a few people are... frank about homosexuality in public, it breaks the ice. Then people are free to be frank about anything and... That's socially useful.

Before Carlos demands it, yesterday and today's pizza, keep the change. If you need pictures, I'm a photographer. Really? A photographer? This picture is nice.
I saw it. - That's fucking gross. - Dude, that was fucking mingin'. Let's get out the dart gun. - Yeah. - There you go.
I get out the truck and talk to 'em. Or he screams out, like, "chocolate thunder." See, I don't know. I feel like men are more romantic than women. When we get married, we marry, like, one girl. 'Cause we're resistant the whole way, until we meet one girl and we think, "I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry this girl, she's so great."

In equal measure. What's an insult about that? That I'm crazy and I'm not funny. Well... I don't know if you're not funny, tell me a joke. So there's a child molester and a little boy walking into the woods.
But instead of painting on a canvas you're painting your face. My mom was a model and she was beautiful. Tall, blond. Not like me. Body that could stop a truck.
Tall, blond. Not like me. Body that could stop a truck. And she had these girlfriends, beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley and they would come over in the morning and put their makeup on together before they went on jobs. Up.
My mom died when I was 7 and it's my first lesson. You know, you won't be the new girl forever. Beautiful. Shit. Did you use my towel again?
Yeah. I wanted to make sure that you got the resume that I e-mailed you. You did. Great. Becky Fuller again. I was just wondering if... Yes, I did call yesterday, but I updated my resume last night and thought you might...
This was a service. This was a service. It had nothing to do with "kill" or "murder" or wh... it was a service. It was a medical service that was being done. I can't be clearer. I can't be clearer than that, your honor.
The night he died, Louis Tobin left an envelope with all the details of the fraud. Why did he do that? He was going to confess. And then Joe found the envelope and kept it. So you don't have the evidence.

It's men like me who survive. And conquer. Men like me who understand the fight is not about who's right but about who's left. You see these hands, son? These hands have taken the lives of a hundred men. These eyes have seen the last breaths ebb from a hundred chests. And these feet... have stood over a hundred fools... who thought they were gonna kill me.
What is she doing? What are you doing, Shimmer? You're getting me all decked up! Trying to make me look beautiful! girls don't look beautiful because of these things.
All men die. Oh no. No cell phones then. lf all the men die, what will happen to me? You're bad. This cream has an extra care skin nourishing lotion.. ..which contains Aloe Vera, Calamine and Jojoba oil.. ..which restore the pH scale of the skin.
At a neighbour's... - No, they're always together. - Our report states that she was alone. Who killed her? We can't really tell without an autopsy.
Excuse me? Excuse me. I lost my ring. Do you see it over there? Excuse me, I lost my ring. Do you see... It fell?
My civilization depends on energy as no civilization before us. Energy is the main currency for us. Is it the same for you? Does your way of life also depend on unlimited energy? What we must do is to take care of the waste from nuclear power plants.
Because conditions on the ground will change. The conditions down in the rock will be stable. But on the surface you never know what"s going to happen. There could be wars, there could be an economic depression. At the surface the clock runs very fast.
We will fill the chambers of Onkalo with nuclear waste from Finland, one little country in the north. After one century we will seal Onkalo for all eternity, just like the tombs in the Pyramids were sealed never to be opened again. The safety of disposal shall not be dependent on any active management, or active surveillance, or any acts of human beings to be safe. So it has to be fully passive. The repository will be closed down;
Once upon a time man learned to master fire, something no other living creature had done before him. Man conquered the entire world. One day he found a new fire, a fire so powerful that it could never be extinguished. Man revelled in the thought that he now possessed the powers of the universe. Then in horror he realised that his new fire could not only create, but also destroy.
You're better at riding than I am, and I'm a better thrower. Greg, save some for everybody else, honey. Can't. I need to bulk up. VVhy?
- His PIN number? Money, money, money, it's all you ever talk about. - Your tie's undone. - Yeah, it's been a long day. Listen. There are some people after me.
Yeah. People don't get given chances. Not like the chance I'm giving you. Now, your mate Mr. Norton, your friend Billy. He couldn't run a firm, he couldn't even bring me the right spade.
And sleep. Soren, we mustn't fall asleep. I think they're trying to moon blink us. Moon blink us? Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.
Soren, we mustn't fall asleep. I think they're trying to moon blink us. Moon blink us? Sometimes in the desert, owls would get exhausted and collapse under it. When they woke up, they just weren't the same.

My loves ... Where does your story begin? At your birth? Then it starts in horror. At the birth of your father?
Well, we made a deal ages ago. Men, babies, doesn't matter. We're soul mates. It was the perfect end to a perfect day. - Good morning. Where is everyone?
I am leading the way through the menopause maze. With my vitamins, my melatonin sleep patches, my bio-identical estrogen cream... progesterone cream, a touch of testosterone... - She's the hormone whisperer. - I am. I've tricked my body into thinking it's younger.
This whole thing with the girls-- that was Buster's idea. Buster? Lieutenant Monroe. He slipped the girls the drugs... dropped me off at another bar down the street. Pete wasn't even with us at that point.
I was trying to decide which way to end my life. That phone call saved me from making a terrible mistake. when you retire to the jury room... I'm going to ask you to consider one word in deciding Pete's fate. what is that word? The word I want you to think about is an ordinary word.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me. My mom gave me to my dad. Sally? You want to see your room? What do you think?
Magnificent. She must have plastic in her shoes. It will eat any petroleum product. We're working on that. What happened to the bacteria?
She must have plastic in her shoes. It will eat any petroleum product. We're working on that. What happened to the bacteria? They live as long as they feed.
This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine I shall be pinched to death Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? And Trinculo is reeling ripe. How camest thou in this pickle?
To those beautiful, ignorant bastards! Rest assured that, dry though the country may be, I am in the midst of concluding arrangements that will keep Atlantic City wet as a mermaid's twat. Jeez, Nucky, you're fucking mermaids now? Every vote counts, Mr. Mayor. A Republican through and through.
You think so? It's everything we've talked about. This is our bomb! Listen to this city, contaminated by shitty music... It's time to strike back.
I was worried the whole thing was a tad complicated. You know, for a dog. Paws! Let's show our friends what we have up our metaphorical sleeve. A dog's sensitive hearing has always been considered a tactical advantage.
Yeah, than fade away -When did you get back, B? -Last night. Blew it out over McCann Street with those two flautas, Carter and Wheatley. Oh, no, those girls are such sluts.
I stayed to protect you. You stayed to protect us? From what? Yes. From discovering too soon
- Nicole. This goes for you with Nicole too. Now, there's certain things you just don't... you don't talk to girls about, you know? It doesn't matter how special they are or what you have and haven't done. Girls, they get frightened.
You know what the bush is about? It's about massive trees that've been standing there for thousands of years and bugs that'll be dead before the minute's out. It's big trees and pissy little bugs. And everything knows its place in the scheme of things. Everything... everything sits in the order somewhere.
It's big trees and pissy little bugs. And everything knows its place in the scheme of things. Everything... everything sits in the order somewhere. Things survive because they're strong and... everything reaches an understanding. But not everything survives because it's strong.

This is too hot. - Is dinner ready? - Yes, it's ready. You're not telling me. Yes, I'm telling you. Bring the napkins.
That's us. Everybody's had their mattress too long. Am I right? You didn't follow that advice about flipping it every few months and now you've worn a groove into it, and you think, "Well, I'm used to it. "So, hey. But I do miss the way it felt "when it came fresh out of that bag."
That's the last issue, right? We're also encouraging you to begin frequent audits of cattle slaughterhouses as practiced by McDonalds. This would ensure that the captive bolt gun usage is consistently rendering the animal unconscious before slaughter. Cows were my favorite animal when I was a boy. Marvelous creatures.
You ever seen a baby calf taken away from its mother? - No. All these cows have had their children taken away from them several times. Usually within about 24 hours after birth. Then they're hooked up to machines twice a day for months, and we suck out the milk that they were producing for their stolen children.
- No. All these cows have had their children taken away from them several times. Usually within about 24 hours after birth.

The girls are raised in crates until they're ready to birth themselves.
Daisy, you look like you're stoned. I mean, seriously let's just, like, get our shit together here. I thought you wanted to whip these guys into shape. - Um, I think I can handle it. Actually, we're hoping you can help us handle some other unruly beasts.
I'll go with you if you kill this dog. What the hell's the matter with you? I'm not gonna kill this dog. - Why not? I thought you wanted to save animals' lives.
She thought you were looking at the dirty pictures in order to find out about sex and to find out what you were missing out on or something. I knew. I knew you were looking for your Original. I used to have these huge urges to have sex sometimes.

- Qantas. Can you give me Qantas lost luggage at LAX, please. Yes, hello. I'm checking on some luggage. Hang on. - Do you have the baggage's receipt?
This is nice. I can change channel when I am tired of your face. Shut up, you kid! Let me tell you! If I press this remote control, your woman will be burnt to ashes.
Your problem? Your challenge? I don't know if I have what it takes for everybody's regular plan. I've never felt, like, that love like the guy is the whole deal, like.... To be honest, the baby thing? Never. Never. I'm just good at this one thing, you know?
I mean, you can still move out, but you're gonna be monogamous too, okay? - Sure. - Okay? Give me a real yes. I think it's gonna be okay. I know it's gonna be. I know it's gonna be okay. - Go. - All right.
She's really something, that Marianne... do you realise that? I talked with her all night she's got her head screwed on alright. Despite what you might think, she's certainly no victim. When I think about my mother and my grandmother and my great grandmother...
- I didn't realize. I'm sorry. Oh, God. There's a meeting tomorrow. You're joking. I'm not.
Sorry. It's all right. This dispute's got nothing to do with what skill level you are. Ford decided to give you less money because they can. They're allowed to pay women a lower wage than men.
The Chequers? Wow, that's a lot of restaurants. Not to mention the all-expenses-paid trips to the party conferences to the union conferences. In Paris, no less. The Gallic rank and file.
No, they come by road with any survivors. The two last ones have not returned. We are controlling the numbers. But we can't keep shooting. We are low on supplies. Do you have any communications equipment?
"Truth is always bitter." "Girls are the basic root of sorrows." "Truth is always bitter." "Girls are the basic root of sorrows." "They cry for every small thing."
We don't look at it the way we should. But we look at it just as it looked four years ago. Correct? - Correct. The star called Turios that we see.
You got a girl? They're creatures, I mean it, freaks. I found her in the garbage. An infant, wet and crying in the garbage. And I plucked her away from all that and I... I gave her a home. Hey there.
I did not hear back from Marshal Cogburn and he did not appear. Then one day I received a note from the marshal with a flyer enclosed. He said he was traveling with a Wild West show, getting older and fatter. Would I like to come visit him when the show came to Memphis and swap stories with an old trail mate? He would understand if the journey were too long.
You know his dad's- - No. - What? - 58th is too far downtown. - Well, yeah.
Well, that's exactly the problem. Right. I'm tired of all the attention I get because of the way I look. I'm tired of every guy I meet either being too intimidated to talk to me, or think that he can just stroll up and ask me out. Hmm. I can't tell you how many times a guy has tried some cheesy pick-up line or howled like a dog as I walk by. I mean, is it too much to ask for just a little conversation before telling me that you're envisioning me naked?
Rupert. You don't need my consent to have a girlfriend. Oh, fiancée. We're engaged. Well, engaged to be engaged. I want to get McKenzie breast implants. A diamond is more traditional.
That's bullshit. " They just go, "okay. Oh, fuck. What hole can i put this in That'll depress me the least?" And i have- I have met some women Since i been single, And they've been younger, Mostly,
From their point of view, we see Columbus and his men landing in the New World. Some small boats are on the shore. The children are hit by a disgusting smell while the strange creatures, wet and dirty, some bearded, others bald, stumble on the sand. The children laugh and make comments, trying to understand who these strangers are --" I, Christopher Columbus, humble servant of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile, in the name of Jesus Christ,

The pits and on the grid tension prevails. With the world title at stake, everyone is very nervous. Today Ayrton Senna left the meeting the pilots. He argues that the first should start on the left of the grid, not on the right. If the interior was clean, would be better inside.
Allow me to join you. I request that you take him too. But he's too young. Shinzaemon, you're wrong. Devotion knows no age.
Alice. Bye. Little Red Riding Hood, Little Red Riding Hood... Don't walk alone in the dark. Never trust a stranger who approaches you with kindness. Beauty does not accompany wisdom.
Sean's a hell of a surgeon, you know. I'm inspired by him. - Are you inspired by Dr. Troy? - Not really. You know, sometimes there are things that I envy about him: All the women.
This man was going into the service entrance. What if he went through her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers? He hailed a cab when he left. See the medallion? Phone the cab company.
He's working on it. It's like this whole thing suddenly came to life. Why now? Why not when they first got there? Perhaps their initial impact wasn't enough to trigger an alert. But now...
Didn't you say that the shuttle may never be fully functional? We may need the shuttle for any number of reasons... I'm not going to leave those people down there with nothing... You cannot let them stay, Colonel... I have made my decision.
I missed you, too, beautiful. (locks door) Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat?
He died in australia a couple days ago, And, um, I flew down to get him. My condolences. Yo. The coffin was supposed to go on thelane in Sydney,
Yes, but this one has a family. I know where they are, I know their names. I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut. And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out? Another doctor, a nurse, no one?
And you are saying this happened in Iraq? The country? Yeah. Please, listen to me, okay? Listen to me.
But I want full immunity. Amanda, are you seeing this? Where the hell are the rods? We've picked up trace radiation signatures. The rods were here.
Only one car left the parking garage. One minute after the crash. Northeast exit, a blonde woman was driving. Hassan was probably in it. Can you track it?
What, that's such a hard question? No, but you're not gonna like the answer. Try me. You ever pull half the legs off a spider, you know, to see if it could still crawl around? Or bury a dog up to its head in the ground to see if it'd eat the dirt to get out of the hole?
I think he did what people expected of him. But he loved us. That's what counts, right? I don't get what you're saying. You don't have to.
Beloved brothers, citizens of "Our Home", ministers. As you know, our work helping those who come from the planet requires discipline, privations and great devotion. The process of renovation of human life has reached a boiling point. I come to ask for renewed efforts from those engaged in our colony's edifying services. A great war with a worldwide scope is starting.
I never thought I'd say this to you, but one day all answers are revealed. All. Why am I like this? Why do I do people harm? One day you'll understand. When that day comes you'll feel a certainty, and you'll grow when the certainty is unshakable.
Why am I like this? Why do I do people harm? One day you'll understand. When that day comes you'll feel a certainty, and you'll grow when the certainty is unshakable. This soup's horrible, it doesn't taste like anything.
Galilee didn't know, but our times were changing forever. In those days Jesus Christ was around, the man who drew crowds with his miracles and his words, which echoed in every corner. And the Senator met this man one day in a dream. In an instant, a radiant instant, one capable of changing our existence forever. And if this instant goes away how many years will it take to rebuild the lost past?
I have no idea. So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech. He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics. He said these equations are so advanced that only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life - could've come up with them. - So...
Because you became a mother. It's just a line of chalk in a cave. The job is yours if you want it, Kate. What is the job? There's a light at the center of the island.
MacGruber, I was so worried about you. Well, I was really worried about you, too, Vick. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, I only have, like, two of these vests... so if either of them got shot up... it would be a real bummer for me.
I'm a man of peace. This is my home, these are my people. Hey, hey! Shit! He'll give it back. Two days ago, a Russian convoy... carrying the X-5 nuclear warhead got jacked.
You got me. Past tense. They were... Yeah, it's really quite a sad story, actually. What do you mean? I had assembled the greatest dream team of thugs... in the history of the world. I had them all in one room... and I also had some homemade C-4.
Everyone betrays me I hate -Down, I'm bad I busted The syringe in the arm in the toilet Fonçdé Descend, I'm bad My arm is gangrenous
- That's great. Stay close. Looks like it's members only. Well, then you gotta join the club, Fi. We gotta get ears on those guys.
Trinity. That's what you are. I lost my daughter. Me too. Daniel Graystone says he can bring my daughter back. But can I trust him?
I lost my daughter. Me too. Daniel Graystone says he can bring my daughter back. But can I trust him? Our daughters... they're gone. Yes. But...
What? That's right. Make an avatar. We talked about this before, remember? I cannot make... another avatar. No matter how many bones you break, the program is gone.
Just do it. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Hey, whatever-your-name-is, wake up, okay? Maybe this'll work.
I haven't, no. See, that's surprising to me, as every other sheriff to whom I've spoken has. The amounts are so great, in fact, we can only assume a vampire is responsible. An act of self-loathing so shameful that whoever is responsible should fall on his own stake. Respectfully, Magister, I'm not sure I follow your logic.
I'm going. With or without you. Fairies? You seriously expect me to believe she's fairy? A species extinct for millennia?
So please... Talk to me. Please. All right, I didn't want to have to do this. I know what the robot's tolerances are.
What a fucking freak. It's a shame the ring doesn't fit. Why didn't you bring one of mine along when you bought it? I didn't know you then, did I? So when did you buy it?
So you must think I'm really gonna make you look bad. I don't care what you make me look like, I want you to go on a date with me. Do not go on a date with him. Can't go out on a date until the story comes out. - Okay, fine.
It'll attract too much attention all at once. But after a couple of years you'll get everything. I don't want your money. Come on. That's rash.
Transfer control to them. Anything? I wrote it in ancient, so it could take a while for somebody to... What is it? We got a message.
We're looking at the way in right now. You need to go there as quickly as you can. Go right now. We're on our way. What's going on? I'm getting a message.
- Trick? You the ho. I'm the ho? You the ho with that ho mouth. Should be eatin' out this peach with that ho mouth. Oh, I will eat that peach.
Sweet Georgia with a fiddle! My goodness, sir. Is that Florida crabgrass? This is a St. Augustine community only. Now, crabgrass is as contagious as a brush fire.
Once the trustee arrives, all funds will be frozen and our hands will be tied. Where have you been? Out. Took a walk. A hike.
I've opened up other businesses in my day but none have filled me with the pride and humility I feel standing before you at this moment. Your people were at the forefront of the Ghost Dance movement of the last century struggling to assert your identity against an overwhelming invasion by a foreign culture. Well, I believe in my heart, tomorrow's opening of this casino offers us all a second chance for self-determination and in some small way, may right some of the wrongs that history has left us. How long do you think it will take him to defrost? A dressed deer can take a day or two.
You get long? Because you expect me to drink. 174 km / h with a caravan, put it on hold. I found it. Y are plenty in the caravan. Well...
I have work to do. Do you feel any pain that's deep and persistent? Not just muscles or joints. Everything hurts all the time. That's football. It might not be just football.
If Pericles were... Shh. He will not. How can you be certain? Because I will never leave your side.
He's not our guy. I know that. You do? I talked to the state lab. They told me about the flour that was found on Friddle.
So.. When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime. And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace. He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook, Mama and ... Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace. He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook, Mama and ... Mrs Whittaker quite a shock. Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
Why would you do that? Because I had to know. Look, I'm just a regular guy, okay? I don't think about, like, energy or whatever. But I know this hand is bad. And I lie awake at night, and I think about the things that it's done and the children that it's hurt.
And yeah, I guess you were part of it. I'm better now. Good. Life has its low points, and we just have to deal with them. Speaking of which, How do we get out of this?
Chloe, what's wrong? The apple is such a plain yet fascinating fruit. What are you doing here? You know, it was the apple that launched the Trojan War, One of the great epic battles of all time. And, also, in many religions here, it's the apple's fall from the tree of knowledge that represents the fall of man.
That's the problem with looking out for people -- sometimes you lose yourself. Don't worry. No one's getting lost, okay? Everything's under control. Here's something. There was an altar with markings similar to the ones used by the band of merry men.
Do you really think I'm an idiot? One of us certainly is... I can guarantee you that. What's up Senad? I'm watching the ants, teacher...
Fuck Sparta, sir... This session will have a single point on the agenda... and we all know what that is... Are there any suggestions to complement the agenda? The roof is leaking, sir... That's not within our range of competence...
That piece you see out there might be - A whole lot farther than you think. Guarantee it. How far would you say? I wouldn't say. I just know it'll be farther than I think.
But when he got inside, it turned out there was a big ol' grizzly bear sleeping in there! Joe faced himself a dilemma. Sure death outside... and sure death inside. - Well, what did he do? - Ol' Joe, he took the quicker route.
Just a few words as if fallen from his mouth, extolling the virtues of the House of Batiatus. I shall compose something appropriate for the occasion. No need. I've already seen to it. My hands are no longer my own and now you seize my fucking tongue?
I think he wants to marry. It's wonderful, yes? Maintaining a new household ... But it does ask you anything. But it will come.
His left fist alone? Why are you aggressive? I do not see why I'll help you. You do not always say that, if you see what I mean. Don't bring up the past.
Well, I was waiting for Forensics to give me a report on that piece I found at the scene. - It's an intake manifold valve from a 1998 V10. - So? So Ted would never let anything in his car that wasn't new. This part in particular was recalled.
See, you can't 'cause the shop's closed. And it stays closed until you recover. No discussion. Thanks for worrying. But there's nothing to worry about. It was about a week ago.
I think he blew out our brakes. Come again? The emergency brake system is complicated. Physical brakes combined with a magnetic system that's controlled by the computer. Problem is, the emergency brakes in the unfinished cars aren't tied into the computer yet.
Make sure it's well-greased. That big wheel needs to go up. I'm impressed, Prior Philip. You've made astonishing progress since I left. And it's not just the church, Richard. Everyone has the money to buy things.
See, borders go right to the top! And the stars; are they Belgian? 'Course they're Belgian. But papa, the earth turns. So those stars go to France and become French.
And the stars; are they Belgian? 'Course they're Belgian. But papa, the earth turns. So those stars go to France and become French. No. No. You see, stars travel abroad but they don't like being there.
But, oh, boy, you become a female engineer and you just sentence yourself to dying alone in a lab! I don't want you to die. - Because even guys who are dorks, like you, they think they're too good for you and want, you know, some hot sorority chick instead! But where does that leave girls like me, Rusty, huh? Yes, I know I'm a little of f-putting when you first meet me. And yes, I had a lazy eye until corrective surgery at age ten.
I'm gonna go have a pomatini. Why don't you ask him about the receipt? Receipt? What's he talking about? Oh, he worries, you know?
Think about it first. I can't do it lightly. Once the deal is done, check that nobody has followed you. We will arrest you with the others and after that, I'll ask for you to be released. I agree to play the snitch, unless it's too dangerous.
"That a rock would become jade" "Like lovers" "We mean to give romantic chase" "But give up at the problems we face" "I see the sun rise in the sky"
Close to what? Wiping everyone? The opposite. Reflection. Like an echo.
- Underground? - That's right. I believe I have a hypothesis as to how this virus behaves. Go on. The receptionist had a very different reaction to the virus and I believe I know why.
A hundred percent. Let's have you walk a mile in these. "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. " So, let's do that. And write about how comfortable they are.
Handsome dude got a big ol'hole in his pec. What's the first thing that pops into your head when I say Sampson? A vacuum you can use in space. Thank you. What can you tell me?
Actually, I am. Ruby says you're a psychic? Can you turn on your powers and predict my future? Derek, I'm a diviner. Not a blender.
- I forgot where I parked my car. - Shall we? [Chuckles] We shall. You know, you must think I'm crazy for being so happy that it wasn't J.F.K. I'm very impressed.
But it's ridiculous to think there's anything on this planet worth seeing which merits crossing what are literally astronomical distances. Maybe aliens are anthropologists? Maybe they just want to study our religion and sex and... love and our funny languages and line dancing? That's an interesting possibility I hadn't considered.
Killing that poor crazy woman for her video. Yeah, by the way, that video, it was hid down her throat on a thread of dental floss, you moron. He is a moron. You are definitely a moron! Well, not literally, figuratively.
I never said that. But what are you doing here? You said that Ana was a closed chapter. I meant for you to leave it alone because, no offense you and your sisters of mercy can be a bit overwhelming. The situation is a bit delicate.
- You guys, with me. Come on. - All right. - All right, make a hole. Make a hole. - I got the back.
Sorry. I just... Thank you so much. You just cannot understand what this means to me. Thank you. We love you! I was just in my dressing room, and I was looking out the window, and I was looking up at the big, bright sky, and there are so many stars. And I thought,
I had my eye on these beautiful diamond stars. I told myself they were diamonds, but I'm pretty sure they were just CZs. My mom said I had to get the starting-out earrings and those were just boring old gold balls. You know, just the real plain ones. She said I could change them out if I was responsible enough to clean them, but she never let me.
Obi-Wan, this line of questioning borders on torture! I assure our pacifist Duchess that all is under control. I'm trying to expose a bigger threat. Interesting. The droid displays unusual hostility toward the honorable Kin Robb,
They drew all our attention over to there from here. These guys over here also returning fire from there. They fucking flanked them. You can see where the path is here where the fuckers came up. Okay, where's this fucking compound?
DJ Roomba, tearing it up! He likes me. Let's dance for a little while, Mark. What... NutriYums energy bars are just absolutely loaded with high-fructose corn syrup and fatty oils.
You were supposed to scare Lumpy, not beat him half to death. I got him to sell, didn't I? This is blackmail. I got an app for that, homes. How are the girls?
"Growling bellies make for unhappy traveling companions." You want to stop and eat? Kahlan. Cara. What are you doing here?
I read somewhere that if a person gets a liver transplant, their blood chemistry will change in order to accept the donor organ. Sakiru full-body tattoos can cause sweat production to shut down,makes the liver fail. But plenty of people-- bikers-- get full-body tattoos. You never hear about their liver failing. No,Sakiru tattoos are applied with bamboo reeds.
So, a guy dies in a jet-pack explosion, and she won't let us talk to the guy that manufactures jet packs? That's just mean. We don't know that he died in the explosion. He was poisoned. I found that. But you didn't determine whether he was poisoned to death or just to some level of discomfort.
He built his own jet pack? The pack uses fighter jet engineering. That's the missing piece. Sayers ripped off the technology from both of the Tillmans and... He borrowed from the navy, as well, to build his own version, which used the best of all three.
I know! All right. Hey. Hey, Max, come here, here. Throw me the ball. Watch, you see?
I'm chatty. It's part of my charm. I'm saying that our boy here has some skills. He's been trained and trained well. Like right there. That.
Maybe he was a suicide bomber and supposed to be in the car with Sayif. Would look like a terrorist act. Hey, DiNozzo, are you with us? Yeah, boss. Whoever hires the women around here deserves a bonus.
Yeah, you're done. - Haven't found your cart yet, huh? - Nope. The school assigned us scooters. I don't have the core muscles to ride that bitch.
What the hell is this, a supermarket? That's a human being, for God's sake. Listen, old prospector, I know that any new machine scares you, but here's the well-held secret. You know that box that records your favorite television shows? There isn't a demon inside of it.
See how worried those motherfuckers look. We'll be a powerhouse with this wedding, in here and outside. And who might the unlucky girl be? What do you care? Draw her name from a hat. Dear Giuliana, sorry I didn't reply right away.
They nailed me for that tiger. It was Giorgio's fault. He blabbed during confession. All in all, reform school wasn't so bad. It was good training for my future career. Then we started doing our first jobs. Heaters, irons, household items, soccer balls all stuff we'd keep in our secret clubhouse and then sell at a cheap price around the neighborhood. This heater's nice. I'm interested.
-Pull those fucking keys out! Hey, guys, here! Watch out! Watch out! The engine got flooded!

BATMAN: After studying your files I discovered your colleagues used your lab for their own purposes. They worked to develop a unique, hybridized gas designed for the specific purpose of triggering volcanoes. But why? Imagine what despots and dictators would pay for this gas and its awesome ability to destroy any enemy any country, from within. Only the experiment backfired.
Your mom's just excited. Now what were you saying about christening the place? Sorry to disturb. I saw the light on and thought I'd grab my plates. Sure. Come in. I mean, it's not locked. Because, you know, there is no lock.
Touchy. Jesus. Change your tampon. I was just asking a question. It's very dark. Thought you hated those boots.
And remember, you guys are my b.F.F.S from N.Y.U., so-- we got it, Blair. We're closed for businessmen. My mother said she wanted me to pack the crowd with wholesome American girls. So you hired escorts? B., you couldn't just tell your mom you don't have friends at N.Y.U.?
Well, right now-- now... I get to do them with you as my girlfriend, which is why just sitting here with you is the most romantic date I can imagine. Humphrey, you just earned yourself some extra benefits. If you are what you wear, you better dress the part you want. A few lucky ladies can do no wrong.
Logan was an idiot. Mm-hmm. We slipped him some blood when he started getting All poser slayer with that comps. I needed his family's journal. I couldn't let him die. What'd you want with the fell journal?
Come here. Give me one. Thank you. It's gonna be okay. Yeah, I know.
- A hair dresser. Why do you take me to a hair dresser I don't know? My hair has been cut by our neighborhood barber since 25 years. He knows my hair. He became blind 10 years ago but can still cut mine hair.
So this is where you hid yourself away. I think you've got some explainingto do. There's children down here. What's all that about? Protesters and citizens of limited value are fed to the beast.
It's how you keep score. Oh great, an old box. It's from one of the old starliners. A Home Box. What's a Home Box?
And the man with the knife was you. That sound right? Oh, my god. Helen. In my dream, I saw a knife,
What does it matter? We're studying trends, Theories, systems of beliefs that effect people. Small subsets of people. Like those who first believe that the earth is round.
So really, everything you got is because of Sil. Excuse me? Sil was a genius. It was his idea, right? Throwing Mick off that scaffold?
You know what? This is the worst thing you've ever done, And I'll never forgive you! You started it! What are you looking at? Well, I just heard- I was the one who read haley's diary.
Oh, Jill, what have you done? Find her. You lied to us. I had a mother. I had a brother. You met him once.
What you said about a vaccine, that you're getting closer... it is true, isn't it? I promise. How? How will you find it? We're developing it synthetically in the lab. Everyone here's dedicated to finding a cure.
Oh, God, thank you. I'm actually a comedian. Oh. Like Whoopie Goldberg? Sort of. Ed, my ex, hates Whoopie Goldberg.
Take a deep breath. I'm good. I believe you. When did you last have a decent night's sleep, Jeff, eh? One or two months ago.
Mr. Roberts: Happy birthday, son. Happy birthday, james. What's up? She was first. Angle of the wound suggests the ax came down from above.
In the animal kingdom, It can be as simple as a female presenting her backside. My advice--if you want to stop the hostility, You've got to find a way to diffuse the sexual tension. - It's fine, betty. get over to your party. - I will in a minute. what about this image?
It's gonna be fine. Look, we'll go right after practice tonight. No no, there's no more "we," all right? You've helped out enough. I'm doing this alone.
It's consistent with partial blood clotting. Which would make sense, because Renee was killed before she fell through the elevator shaft. Well, look at this. Well, this blood's a little different. Look at that.
I took the job at tabula rasa just to get near her. So you planned on killing her the whole time? I wanted to figure her out. It didn't make sense that she was working as a receptionist. Paige's suicide really changed her life, didn't it?
I'm not gonna make it. I'm just gonna come with the idea and say, "This is what I want, and I want this like that." Thierry's creative process, I guess, he's inspired by other things. I guess who isn't inspired by other things? We have, like... Like, he goes, and he, like... four different-color Post-its in here.
Somewhere it's great, but from the people, I think I got accepted, you know? It comes to a point that I got accepted. Originally booked to run for just five days, "Life is Beautiful" stayed open for a further two months, and as word about MBW spread, his pieces appeared in galleries and shows around the world, from Miami and New York to London, Paris, and even Beijing. He's kind of the rightful heir to Andy Warhol, in a way.
I used to take things that, when the sewing was different, I call it designer, and I'd put the price that is $400. So from $50, sometimes I could make $5,000. But there was one very unusual thing about Thierry. He never went anywhere without a video camera.
And if you don't mind one more thing. Mike, go ahead and throw in a map of Kentucky. Yeah. Yeah, the deer that Bo's hunting, it's open season wherever the bluegrass grows, but he might not pursue it past the state line. Mike, I need you to check my trigger.
Pulled his records. Looks like this gentleman used to weigh 400 pounds or so, Till he got a gastric bypass, Which brought down his weight considerably. But then for some reason, last night, He decided to go on a twinkie binge. So, he died from a twinkie binge?
And he's lucky to have you looking out for him, Dean. But you're not the only one. Is that so? I remember everything, you know. When I died.
Look at them. Remember this? Can I? I turned this land into a bee farm, as you always wanted. These pictures... I took by myself.
I'm not a ghost. I'm a catfish. You created the reflection, didn't you? Without you, I couldn't have done so. She seems to have everything I don't. Most women don't have what you have.
Excuse me. Auntie... I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery. In fact... the film was not even developed. I was obsessed with this new creature.
{\pos(192,240)}Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. {\pos(192,240)} - Dwight, don't be gross. {\pos(192,240)}Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough.
No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with.
Ah Henry, It's great, isn't it? Ian Spankler. British. I picked it up for three hundred Just before he took off. Three hundred dollars? Three hundred thousand.
Take a deep breath and relax. With each breath, let the life around you fade into the background. Just listen to the ticking of the metronome. Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead. The universe is desolate.
Well, if it's the same people, They've been doing this for close to a decade. I told you. * mama's gonna buy you * * a billy goat * Nietzsche wrote,

For God sakes, why don't you go under the house and look? Hey, Cam. Cam, where did we get this dolly from? From Janice and Olivia. They brought it over yesterday. Lily loves it. Seems a little frilly, you know, coming from them.
- Love you! - Eyes on the road. Whoo! Oh, God. I mean, things don't always work out. Oh. Cam, I think she wants her doll.
I mean, things don't always work out. Oh. Cam, I think she wants her doll. I don't know where it is. [Child's Voice] Mommy. Mommy.
- OK, it has to stop. I am busy. [Mark] Hey, Torres. Do you know anything about putting together cribs? - You bought a crib? - Sloan's coming home tonight.
Agent Lisbon, CBI. You mind running this down for us? Someone opened this flask and left it under the tank. It contains an airborne form of Cryptohansa B strain. It's an engineered super-virus.
No. But this might. It's a match. Gun bluing? You think the prints can, uh... survive the hot water and the bleach?
Imagine never having to say good-bye to your loved ones again. Imagine a future without loss, brought to you today. Grace by Graystone. Because some memories should live forever. We're still negotiating for the rights to the song, but that's how the finished spot will look when it airs.
I'm an expert. So Bell just brought in more ice. They're probably bathing the condensate. It's the most dangerous part. If I'm right,they just completed the Wacker oxidation stage to keep the temperature down.
This time, I won't make the same mistake. We're right back where we started. There's no getting through these cliffs. If we can't go through... we'll go over. Where's Cara?
I am. So who's in charge here? You are. Then let's ride. Richard's boots made these tracks, mistress.
I will save you, mistress. It's too late. Then I will avenge you. (Nicci) Forget revenge. Bring me the stone.
It seems we have another. ( thunder rumbling ) It may not be too late. ( voice of the Keeper ): No! Richard, we've done it. ( gasps ) Welcome back from the dead, Nicci.
It's just, it's just, uh, she texted me "yes". What? ! Yeah. Oh, splendid! Splendid. Ah, Jethro. Palmer's embalmer said yeah, huh? The little funeral home girl?
- I mean, what annoys me about london-- So your solution is that 78-year-old women And as they slip away into death, the little babies-- And how is that baby then raised? Who looks after the baby? Because it's a pretty good system--
Come on people, this is the first rose being planted in neighbourhood. Let's plant it altogether. Friends, tea break! Do you still wonder why the butterflies live for 2 days? Oh, the old topic.

If Kobe keeps playing the way he's playing for the rest of his career, he's gonna end up ahead of Jordan. Well, nobody's better than Jordan. I mean... Is that you're Dad? How about a test drive, son? So, aren't you gonna tell me about the  <hon>Malibu<hoff>'s impressive fuel economy?

It was just so stupid. She was so stressed over that Draber case, you know? She called it her "career-maker." That's what she said. "Career-maker." So you argued.
Good stuff. Morning. I'm off to work. Someone around here needs to be a responsible adult. Also, you have grass all over your back.
I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink? Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it? ! The light!
It's not that I don't love you, but I'm still not sure that we have a future together. You're really freaking me out here. I've gotta go. Come on. I found your mustache.
Don't worry. Is this ok? Send the van back after off-loading. Bring the stuff here... And keep it carefully.
But I'm Joey Donner, captain of the football team. Plus, they just voted me best profile and whitest teeth and flattest abs. And further plus... I'm sorry. Okay, then.
That part's a little unclear. See, this is what you really needed advice about. Here's how you know if it's a date... If he's made a plan and if he pays. Sorry, did I just stumble into Mad Men?
Stacy who? The cute, tall girl. That's her right over there. That's not how she looked first period. [Bianca] Girls are like flowers.
I know, I know. Insert "Dead Raccoon" joke here. Dad, what were you thinking? I uploaded that picture of me with hair and then things just snow balled out of control. And the snow ball killed a raccoon and landed on head?
Not till we've searched the place. You guys? Oh, my God! Well, well, I think we've found our killer. Oh, now, now, wait a minute, that's not mine!
Talk about a recipe for disaster. Well, it's all my fault. The last thing I wanted to do was ruin your wekend with Perry. Clark, Perry didn't leave because of you. I-I thought I was ready, but maybe it's still too soon. I guess we were all pretending things were better than they were. I'm sorry I wasn't more honest with you, mom. Even for a weekend,
- Fais dodo, baby. And then also over to Sid-Mar's. Where was Sid-Mar's? See the pumping station? Gone.
Living here now is like a dream, the way that everything in a dream is the same yet not the same. Familiar yet strange. Not quite right, but you just can't put your finger on it. New Orleans was a soap bubble. A soap bubble borne on a zephyr.
What a day, huh? I'm seeing so many people I haven't seen since the storm. Me too. Just in for the day, all the way from Houston, Atlanta... Look, I hope you know, in court we have to represent the office,
Just keep going. Last Monday, we had a jam night at camp. This guy came up to me, told me he's with Rolling Stone, told me my guitar playing is amazing, he's gonna include me in an article called "The 100 Best Guitarists You've Never Heard Of." Oh, that sounds like a good thing. Sounds too good, I'm guessing.
See, the frets are made out of nickel, and nickel reacts like this when exposed to chlorine. There's a rooftop pool at the hotel. If Cole was murdered there, the killer might've cleaned the guitar with pure chlorine. That's why it was so clean when Bebe stole it. Well, the strings are made out of nickel, too, aren't they?
I thought you located them at the scene? Just the one that scared Booth. I've catalogued the loose tissue, and all the victim's organs and glands are accounted for. But the other testicle seems to have vanished. Well, it's not here.
You took off from fantasy camp. You disappeared and you end up hiding out in some cheap motel? I wasn't hiding. We know you and Richard Cole had a fight in Erik Dalton's hotel room. Your blood is on the carpet with his.
It's not those things. It's how you're dealing with them. But while we're here, can we shed some light on something that is serious? Like, say, Timmy's porn addiction? Really? What the hell are you doing on my computer? Dude, you got to erase the history.
- You wanna spy on witches? - Wiccans. No, I want you to spy on them while I study them anthropologically. Ground zero. It's fascinating.
And it's infested with the fungus Claviceps purpurea. Formed in the ergot stage of fungal development, it's hallucinogenic, the natural substance from which LSD is derived. Yes. It was used for ceremonial purposes centuries ago in Salem. Some people think that the exact same substance was responsible for the hysteria surrounding the witch trials in the first place. Those naked ladies were tripping.
I know you guys are afraid, too. But we each have something bigger than our fear. We have each other. Not sure what Kaylie is telling her teammates right now, but they look like they're getting fired up. Guys, we're more than a team. We're a family.
We are going to give it a lot of money. Go ahead. My God! The subject is now isolated and shunned. Incredible.
So what is it? Are you thanking me or reprimanding me? Let's not pretend like this wasn't a big risk. We're thanking you. Send over what you have on the car.
And women don't buy suitcases. Dr. Faye says they do. Could you leave us, please? Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail. You wanted to go with Danny's idea.
They seem more appropriate, if you don't mind my saying. They're a bit fiddly. I wonder if you could help me. Certainly, sir. I see you got that mark out of the sleeve.
Oh, please. There's a meeting of my borstal charity. I've missed two and I simply must be there. You'd have to take Mary or Edith with you. Don't make me.
You got to be confident, smooth. - Girls like guys-- - Don't listen to him. He has no idea what girls like. See, what girls like is to feel special.
Do you have any idea where she would have gone? Oh, probably to the caves where she lived. The caves? But what about the irrigated rudimentary claymations? The what?
- Does it hurt? Like that. - Look what I brought you. - Oh, thank you. - Ah! You should not... - Thought you was dead hungry.
I know what I'm running from. Do you? You came to me, not the other way around. You step into my world, you'll be staring down demons, devils and the like. Those things in your paintings...
She just wants to go to diet camp. - [Connie laughs] - Oh, God. Claire would... check me in the loony bin. Connie: Oh. Our wives are not like you.
We'll never make it to the main entrance from here. What about the garage, the mobile lab van? It's my move, Mr. Allen, and I say we make a run for it. Oh, my God. Barry, look.
Hey, Allen. Hey, Eddie. Flowers. That's so nice. Where were you all night?
He thinks we're going back to his place. I hate that he's right. So, how do you know Amy? Freshman year, uh, we were living on the same floor, and I was the... I keep forgetting to water my ficus.
And the bills that come with it. We have evidence that you were outside the house where my son was taken. Did you see me there? Then I've nothing to tell you. Just pretend you knew something, anything - what would it take for you to tell me?
~ Yeah. ~ Good, good. Come with me. I found your son's drawing. It was in the laundry you left me... ~ I'd lost it? ~ .. folded in your shirt pocket.

You're right. I'm kind of irresistible. Hi, it's Grace Truman. I need to talk to you as soon as possible. If you could just call me back as soon as you get this message?
No, I think you're gonna drop it. - Hmm. - 'Cause if you don't, it's no longer malicious prosecution. It's abuse of power. You did it to Mike Ross, you did it to me, and we're gonna find out who else you did it to. Take a shot.
I'm sure you don't remember that. One of the boxes smelled like violets. Or at least that's what I decided violets smelled like. One smelled like hair spray. And there was one, my favorite, that was this pale pink with sketches of the Eiffel Tower.
Perhaps you could just answer the question. Uh, Agent Blye has something that no Navy SEAL or, uh, Army Ranger does. And, uh, what secret skill is that? She's a woman. Intelligence gathering can be limited if you can't talk to half the population.
You my dog! Hey. Open up. Come back, big dog! So, our dead guy, Brian Bell, had some surveillance cameras. Actually, he had a lot of them.
Wow, this guy's even got less in his fridge than you do. No wonder his dog turned on him. And that is another reason why I don't have pets. Yeah, that and the fact that the only thing you ever managed to keep alive in your apartment was mold and mildew. I had a mouse once.
~ You don't sound very keen. To be honest, sometimes I'm not sure I should go on with it. I mean, what am I trying to prove? ~ We're not having another crisis, are we? ~ No. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder how realistic are my plans.
We're waiting for the prison manifest to confirm names. Any witnesses? The girls were making a pilgrimage to New Orleans when the bus nearly hit them head-on. Bourbon Street or bust. Bust, clearly.
We do what is necessary to win back our homeland. You just executed your nephew. And before that, you sacrificed his family in an airstrike. How was that necessary? You point your finger at Islam.
Cast and crew only. Hey, stranger. Haven't really seen you since the wedding. Kind of feels like we're coming back to school - after summer vacation. - Yeah. I'll see you at the pep rally. Hope we don't get Mrs. Kirkman for trig this year.
So the wedding was so much fun. It was the happiest day of my life. But, you know, what does that say about all the days I have left? We're such a Zoe. Oh, Todd, glad you're here. Hold this. Todd, my jacket is on the floor.
She came to warn me about Mona. Mona can't hurt you anymore. You know that. You can't let your guard down, Ali. Your ex-friends are here tonight.
So what? Is this coming from Allison or from her dad? Did you do something to those girls? Absolutely. What do you mean?
- Thank you. - I am so happy for you, divya. Is everything okay? - Well, since you asked, I'm just leaving my lawyer's office.
Are we ready? We're so cute. There are no pictures of Molasses and me together. Wait a sec. Let's take a photo with the two of us.
- Would you sing for me? - I'd love to. Shall I sing, then? I'm really excited right now. Songs are left 'till tomorrow Time didn't heal my sorrow
That doesn't look good. Hold this really tight. Oh, no! Hey, Russell. Have you heard from the girls?
Have Henry run that, all right? Tell him to put it in the front of the line. This eyewitness software is incredible. No more scanning through endless hours of footage. Yeah. Finn's friend Mark was selling it.
No! No! She's stuck. I can't get her out. We'll have to get another.
Come on, settle down. You okay? Yeah, I thought I, uh... Never mind. Heard from the dog handlers.
Three words you rarely hear strung together. Yet they constitute a thing. Nice work. Ma'am, the African Union forces have bogged down. Uh, define "bogged down."
Yet they constitute a thing. Nice work. Ma'am, the African Union forces have bogged down. Uh, define "bogged down." They're inside the RWA, but they haven't advanced in the last hour.
I took Corsican lessons. - Oh yeah? - Yep, it's to piss them off. I'm sick of hearing them jabbering on without understanding a word. So I found this guy, a singer.
Let Mack know the jet's here. I want him reverse-engineering that cloaking hardware right away. Sooner he does, sooner we get the bus operational again. Roger that. Something else?
Well, don't believe everything you read, Nommo. Check out today's Inquirer, and they'll have you believing a virus is sweeping the city. But you know better. Mm. Not about most things, but, uh... afraid it's less a case of runny nose, more a case of nasty hunger demon. The problem's contained for the moment, but I need answers to finish it off.
Call it a hunch, but, uh... I think this might be working. Mnemoth has always been with us. Through all the famines, the hunger of the starving masses gave the spirit strength. Nothing could satisfy the demon's appetite.
I'm not a doctor. Kendall refused to sign off. And you ordered 20 uniformed officers to protect a floor your patient is no longer on? That was my idea, chief. I want the reporters waiting at the hospital, not searching for evidence.
Yeah, but without the ivory crucifix that his family said he never took off. But that would mean Perez was shot when J-me was 9 and living in Boise. Were the details of the, uh, crucifix ever made public? No, ma'am. So either J-me was psychic or...
She likes the sweet, sensitive type. [Both laugh] - Sounds like dissonance. - What? There's what people say they want in a mate and what they actually click on... dissonance.
Loser goes to exile island. Jeremy versus val, husband Jeremy versus val, husband versus wife. Versus wife. ( applause ) survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go!

And they murdered him because he was trying to help me change my life. Are you sure Natalie doesn't know who's running this ring? Swears she doesn't. Ugly business. Luring these girls with money and the high life.
Just what I do. I actually need gloss. And you need pants. Where are the girls? They where my pants at.

Agree to our terms and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision. I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens. I think that's pretty generous. I know how you manipulate states and force them to join up under you.
And don't change the subject! You were just sucking face with my very evil sister. Sister? Oh that's... oh right! She took my phone.
Find the bedroom, put on your birthday suit. And I'll find you in a jiffy, okay? Hmm? So I've been thinking. You're still a douche bag. But you have the moral high ground.
Well, perhaps you and all those people who asked for light cheese on your stupidly unhealthy kebab on Thursday need to wake up and pass on the experience altogether. Fuckhead. - Come on. - Oh, just... I don't understand, 'cause I do everything my contract says I'm required to do.
Like they took me. Like they took me, Ned! Calm down, Jesse. Jesse, calm down, look at me. This is not the same people.
Jog your memory? And now it all comes back. - That wasn't me. - Stop! We got the bullet, all right?
And even funnier if it was a fat guy. Okay, maybe like Gordon said, our partner ships are going in different directions. My sugar and spice ship is going one way, and your mean and ugly booze cruise is going another. So how about tomorrow, I'll sail my ship, and you can sail yours, Ellen. Done.
I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't gonna go. I wasn't gonna leave the room until Damon walked in to give me my birthday gift. It was a necklace that Stefan had given me. I'd lost it, and Damon knew what the necklace meant to me. My necklace.
No. Just this market? They're everywhere. Tourists feel compelled to buy them, return them to the next of kin. Most times, the tags belong to a vet who survived the war, just got lost somewhere along the way.
Tough muffin full of spite. Bunch of people died. His guilt sparked this nonsense trouble that you have. The monkeys happened because you were in denial. You dealt with that, stopped them.
I think I know why. No signal. Listen, did you get a hold of anybody about Jody's kids? Yeah, I got a text before the signal disappeared. The signal disappeared?
No signal. Listen, did you get a hold of anybody about Jody's kids? Yeah, I got a text before the signal disappeared. The signal disappeared? Yeah, it was good when we got here,

- Hey! Program is hacking your laptop. [Typing] It's overridden the deletion sequence. It's fighting back.
It's everything confiscated from Louis Atwood's home. It's Atwood's notes, theories, history on the house. He was completely consumed by this house. He keeps making reference to a shadow figure he saw lurking there. He really believes he was being haunted by the ghost of the house's former owner Greg Miner.


By now, the worm I planted will have destroyed every last copy of Wilkins' design. So no tablets for the kids. Mission accomplished. Famous last words. While I was sabotaging the printers, I took a quick look at the tablet's OS.
Necessary but exhausting. French Mary Poppins Barbie is the only me that's been any fun. Though I'm not sure how the parents would feel if they knew how many people I've killed. So why are we here? The machine just told me to come to this playground and follow your plan.
Gentlemen, we have a decision to make. One of us got arrested today. It's just a drug charge, but our operation could be compromised. Everything about her checks out. But there's no way for us to know whether she's working with the police or not.
A Kyber Crystal? Yes. Massive in scale like nothing I've ever seen before. We're in pursuit of a Separatist shuttle which is carrying the crystal. What type of support do the Separatist have on Utapau? This seems to be an entire Separatist fleet orbiting the planet.
Three women, early 20's-- a redhead, brunette and a blonde. They were all wearing bikinis, backpacks, sunglasses and hats. Oh, good. That, uh, really narrows it down. All right.
She give you anything? Yeah. Good look at the shooter after her sunglasses came off in the struggle. After she's released from the hospital, I'll put her in front of some photos. All right. So our Vic puts up a fight, and ends up in the morgue.
Okay, what happens if I don't bring you the money? You'll get a package with your brother's head in it. Have a nice rest of your day, Detective. Your suspects were wearing these wigs. HPD found them dumped near the crime scene.
You're joking. Hey, don't look at me-- this is McGarrett's idea. Huh? I'm not wearing this. These girls are surfers;
Hey, don't look at me-- this is McGarrett's idea. Huh? I'm not wearing this. These girls are surfers; we know where they hang out.
Vanessa Hansen was gonna use those codes to drain millions from the bank. Well, that would explain why Wagner put up a fight. Mmm. So she said she followed him from the hotel to the bus put a gun in his side, said "We're gonna get off in a few stops," where there was a car waiting with a laptop inside to do a wire transfer to an offshore account.

Those girls had no idea what they were walking into when they got onto that bus.
I put a call in to the Secret Service for Jerry. You guys give me a second, please? Agent Keane. Thanks for getting back to me. No good waves?
But, uh, I think I may have a-a... another way of getting Matt back. How's that? How? Uh, I pay him his money. You mean the money that doesn't exist?
How's that? How? Uh, I pay him his money. You mean the money that doesn't exist? You say it doesn't exist.
- Eli, this is becoming... Are you gonna bring up the intern? I can't tell you that, Mr. Governor. Eli, I'm not sleeping with her. I understand that, but oppo research is not just about what's true. It's about - where we're vulnerable.
Jacob, help me pick some flowers from the garden. No, thanks, grandma. It wasn't a question. Go. I thought you agreed that starting up the factory again. Would be good for us.
Exactly what part of me saving your life. And let's not forget you're the one who called me. I just want some answers. Don't you think I'm at least entitled to that? We think a returned brought back this virus. From the early 1900s.
I just want some answers. Don't you think I'm at least entitled to that? We think a returned brought back this virus. From the early 1900s. When the virus went through their metabolism, it mutated. Now only other returned seem to be able to catch it.
How? The bullet. It's still in Cooper's head. We asked for it during the trial so they could see that it did not come from my gun. They wouldn't give it to me.
I mean, two weeks ago, people were still saying that the Russians shot Cooper. Russians in Stockton? But you made sure that the whole world knew the truth. 'Cause like you said... The truth is like the sun.
A legacy my husband is proud to uphold, particularly with respect to the former President's long-standing commitment to our military. I know there's been a lot of recent speculation about the closing of bases. Those rumors are simply not true. Fitz is a Navy man who will never take action to diminish our armed forces or in any way risk compromising our strength and security, both at home and abroad. Thank you all!
Let me guess... commander's name is Darren. That's right. And since he's new, introductions will be made. On their own, these two pieces are harmless, undetectable to security.
Whitehall has a weapon that's unpredictable, but he's not. I don't want to be in a footrace to stop him. - I want to be waiting at the finish line. - Which is the city. That's where I believe the Obelisk will lead HYDRA.
- at your assistants? - Objection, Your Honor. Goes to management skills. Yes. Overruled. You may answer, ma'am.
I'm surprised you didn't knock down a wall or two. Oh, I still might. We're having quite a quarter. About this e-mail... You opened it?
Anything else we can't do when Jess is here. Wow. - Look at that stretching. - I don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls. I wouldn't touch them. They'd want for nothing.
It colors your perception. Excuse me? This is not the case to embarrass Hudson or the department with. Pick your battles. I didn't know anyone would see those other videos.
Rollins, you're just telling me this now? I didn't get a chance to speak with you today, sergeant. I'll get you a warrant for his phone. See if the video confirms her story. Okay, Fin, Carisi, go back to these two.
Anthony died protecting me. It's up to me now to make sure his sacrifice wasn't in vain. What will you do? You told me you wouldn't help me fight a war, John. Well, sometimes a war comes to you.
I'm here because she says you want to apologize. You're the one that owes the apology to me. Oh, yeah? Closetcon, 1998. You sabotaged my booth.
Okay, MC Hammer, how do you get a biotracker into someone? Well, as you can see, they're very tiny. Normally, they're hidden in a pill. Any chance he could have swallowed it himself? Not unless he's a crazy-ass.
What are we doing? Trying to beat back the prying eyes of our great overlords. Sebastian. Sorry. It's my anti-hacking app.
Think Bruce could fix the car? Only I call him Bruce. Pride ever consider a mechanic? I asked. He said no. I don't get it.
Well, perhaps. But, uh, if there's one thing I've learned, it's never trust a fairy. Come. Let's get you someplace safe... Just in case.
Even if it is, I find it very difficult to concede that a collection of ones and zeroes is a suspect in a homicide. Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa-- what are you doing? Depending on your perspective, this machine is either a murder weapon or a murderer. Either way, it can't be left to sit here unattended all night, can it?
Everybody knows that one day intelligent machines are going to evolve to hate us. It's a "button-box" thing. What's the "button-box" thing? It's a scenario somebody blue-skyed at an AI conference. Um, imagine there's a computer that's been designed with a big red button on its side.
Well, we aren't, and that's why I couldn't make a living. But then I found a lover, and he found me this touring work, and it's been easy ever since. People just give us their best food and wine, and ask nothing in return. I love being a queen. What are you telling these people?
And I promised that we would take them to Amiens. Would you mind waiting outside? I would like to have a word with my queen. Keep them from leaving. Let us pass.
Them being back is not a blessing. I mean, things were all good before. - They didn't need to change! - Right! - Uh-huh. - And we don't need them here. None of them!
I do not know what you think I did. -I Know what you did. -What Are you talking about? The golden girl sold her sister to the VG newspaper. You must have planted the package.
For the bomb, of course! What? What bomb? The bomb that's going to explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards. You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you.
What's wrong? Probably something minor. I should be able to find the problem. The distributor pin is gone. I swear I locked it in place yesterday.
Ready now! - One. Two. Nothing's happening. - Kuvira must have done some override thing and taken control! - There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here. You spent all that time working with varrick and baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?
Su told me how she took you in when you were younger. It must have been so hard being an orphan. - Don't pretend you know what it felt like. The avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them!
- Okay! Ready now! - One. Two. Nothing's happening. - Kuvira must have done some override thing and taken control! - There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.
Su told me how she took you in when you were younger. It must have been so hard being an orphan. - Don't pretend you know what it felt like. The avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them!
But it's... It's not my b-day. I know, but we're going to miss it, and I hate that. So Kevin and I thought... No, no, I had nothing to do with this. That we would celebrate your birthday today.
But you have to help me and Sharon out a little, too, okay? So look. Now that you've had some time to think... I don't know the girl. I told you I don't know her.
All the animal predation on the right metacarpal, it's gonna be tough to separate the peri- from the postmortem trauma. Okay. Take a look at this. I created a map showing where each body part was found. Whoa, no wonder rats went to town on this hand. It was left in a Dumpster behind a restaurant. Does the map say anything about a waterlogged upper leg?
They came, we fixed, and we conquered. But what happened to those women, liv? They became anita hill, monica lewinsky. They stood up, liv. They stood up and told their story.
It was Olivia, Cher and Madonna. All done by one amazing young man. Okay, can we agree it's time you two split up your finances and officially file for divorce? Or not! Maybe, uh...
Or not! Maybe, uh... Maybe things are fine the way they are. Wait a second, I thought you guys already were divorced. Not officially.
Not officially. And maybe things are fine the way they are. No, Debbie's right. We've avoided the paperwork long enough. It's time to make it official.
Oh, and to you, too. And to me. The Secretary of the Navy is ordering Paul back to active duty to face murder charges at court martial. Thank you. But I'd rather not ever think of Paul Hare again.
I did mention not wanting to be punched, didn't I? Yeah, uh, but it's good cardio. Oh, like that really hurt. That hurt? The ABCs of trauma are a handy tool for keeping a patient alive.
Caitlyn, where's the bomb? Caitlyn Cook put a bomb on one of the motorcade vehicles. Get these people out of the cars and move them back. Alek. His version of events is very different than yours.
Not even in the slightest, OK? And anyway, we can't even think about that right now. I am trying not to. But you said you loved me. We have to put those thoughts in a box.
Max, can you join me? I'm pretty busy waiting on tables right now. Okay, what's going on? Max has never waited on a table in her life. Max, I need you over here.
I remember being a kid and playing on the street, going trick-or-treating. Yeah... even the cosmos idiot agrees. Uh, then cut to Peter, and, uh, keep the guitar going. ...playing on the street, going trick-or-treating. The key is caring and Alicia cares.
Speaking of which... - Yeah? - You've got problems. What's up? A whole bunch of helicopter moms just touched down in your dining room.
And you're not that naive. You don't need to be in love to have sex. You just need a condom. So, do you have one or not? I really don't get you.
They're used... To find paintings underneath other paintings. So it turns out that the building Chad Keswick was looking to buy was leased by the WPA during the Depression. They commissioned a mural for the lobby. The artist was a notorious communist, so when the property passed into private hands in the '50s, the new owners had it painted over.
We were all there We all messed up Any news on the squats? We have two guys on it. We'll send photos of the girls to every station
- He's too scared. - It's over. Not every noble. This law invites the persecution and bloodshed of innocent people who share different beliefs. But it won't stop the Protestant faith from reaching the nobles.
Love potion, yo. I got it all. Summer love, young love, anti-love. You just got to put a little on your fingers and pow! I need that potion.
I now believe that he died because the map had no - informational value. - But it's a copy. Shouldn't all the information be the same? It should. "Should" being the key word.
The witness... Look. I will talk to him again. You can't. You can't take the plea.
Yeah? I need you to help me too. You see, I have a lot of troubles in me. And now it seems that I am... giving them out. What do you mean, giving them out?
Oh! That feels like therapy! John-John? We are here to learn about sustainable fishing practices. Can we do that if you are high? I'm not high.
Good for you. Gets better! She got me this sweet gig selling cars at her dad's dealership. Hang on. You have a legitimate job?
It all started with a news report last week... WJGZ breaking news. Good evening. I'm Guy Ross. The nation's capital tonight is experiencing a city-wide Internet shutdown. And WJGZ has just received word that the interruption of service may be the result of a group of coordinated hackers.
You two got something? Ducky and I have been working to I.D. our server-farm snowman. Cause of death wasn't simply from prolonged computer use, but from a rare disease called fatal familial insomnia. Also known as the inability to fall asleep. When the disease first presented itself, it might've been seen as a bonus to a hacker.
Quite, so the producers told us to buy three old V8-powered cars and report with them to a hotel near the town of Bariloche here in Argentina. This was the meeting point, in the middle of what's billed at Argentina's Lake District. And I was the first to arrive in a magnificent Porsche 928 GT. That is quite a view and this is quite a car. I have always loved 928s, cos they were just so futuristic.
That is the biggest flying bird in the world, isn't it, I think I'm right in saying? And there's another one. Well, there we are - the sun's out, I've seen a condor, all is well in my world. Sadly, I had to leave the big, beautiful bird, because at the hotel, Hammond was waiting to shout at me. Half the interior trim dropped off. Has it?
Oh. I think Hammond really loves that Mustang. Ow! I've lost another gear. It's your route, it's your route.
You know, I just want him to have friends. You know, like a couple girls, and a couple boys. He's gonna be fine. In the meantime, I have made some friends who have welcomed me into the secret world of women. I am this close to discovering everything about them.
You know, like a couple girls, and a couple boys. He's gonna be fine. In the meantime, I have made some friends who have welcomed me into the secret world of women. I am this close to discovering everything about them. What they like, what they don't like.
I have plenty of time to do it. Is he exercising enough? Is he eating right? Does he even want to stay here? I mean, this is the most terrifying thing I've ever done.
It's interesting how you haven't scored any boy 10 out of 10 for anything. The highest is Tonka's 9 for his ability to hold his breath underwater. Joint with Connor's 9 for pet care. He loves that salamander. You'd have to think someone was pretty fucking amazing to give them a 10, right?
No. Look, there's my picture! Why is your picture in the newsletter? "Sixth-Former Amber Dean tells us how she feels "about being asked to attend a trial for Chelsea Ladies." "'I feel amazing.
I mean, just take a look at that babe. That's enough, Bob. This doesn't look good. One squad car still chases us. Must be a rookie driving.
What do you mean? You're scared of jumping in. It's complicated. Why? He flirts with you, he's cute.
How long you think it's been up there? Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours... - ...ten years ago. So for ten years? - Why did it come down so low? - I don't know.
Uh... It's not what I was expecting. [LIGHTS BUZZING] So, what is this place? Well, they built it years ago, but then they ran out of money.
And he's picking his nose. [ALL LAUGH] I'm not making... BOY: Aah!
[ALL LAUGH] I'm not making... BOY: Aah! There's a giant bug, and it's eating everybody's cars!
A real pain in the ass. Yeah. I've heard that before. You know, I sent you a letter like a year ago. Did you get it? Yep.
My parents had a cabin at Big Bear Lake. Dad and I would always go fishing in the morning. Mom would wave to us from the dock. And I was just looking at her in the... And then the cabin exploded.
Okay. So? - I think I might have seen it. - What... What are you talking about? When John sent me back, he was attacked. By a terminator.
The Essex, it's listing. Help me turn around. - That's it, be brave. - Here! Full ahead, Mr. Nickerson. Mr. Chase.
When I heard about the design I needed to see it with my own eyes. - I gotta say it's pretty impressive... - Thank you. That you nearly destroyed an entire planet with speaker cable and aluminum foil. - Yeah, that was an accident.
Where are my friends? Help me! Increase sedative 50 CCs. What have you guys done to me? So, just for the record, this program was under your supervision, was it not?
Sounds like your dad's spinning quite a yarn. Mind if I listen in? Actually, it's getting late. You two need to get some sack time. No, we want more story, please!
They want another $1.9 million by market close. What about the ratings agencies? Moody's, SP... Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds? Where are the ratings agencies at? - They're the fucking same.
That's a perfect title! Casey, right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds onto unsuspecting customers. And they won't devalue them until they get them off their books. This level of criminality is unprecedented, even on fucking Wall Street. And this is me being honest here, okay? It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.
You are now entitled. Entitled to what? Like, free parking? Key to the city? I mean, what does it even really mean?
Vince doesn't want to show the movie till It's perfect. He's an artist. I'd like to respect that. Okay. You know, my wife has a $12,000 chihuahua.
It's 2:00 A.M. You sat down to watch this movie at midnight. I'm mentally prepping. I'm gonna start now. You want to join me? You said I couldn't.
Would you be able to? I changed my conviction Because you were arrested No I'm certain my plan would have succeeded, if my conviction had been right
And so in 1972, the Atlas Centaur rocket blasted off from our planet, a four-stage rocket that launched a probe way out into the blackness of space. The probe would use the energy from the sun and the gravitational pull of our neighbouring planets to cross our solar system. That momentum would then carry it on into the farthest reaches of the universe. The mission, to find intelligent life similar to ours out there in deep space. The probe carried a tablet which had inscribed on it the image of us humans, a man and a woman, and a map to locate us in the universe. Stage four disconnects and our probe is fired on its long journey.
It's going to be a clear night. The stars will be out soon. The Little Prince, he was very fond of sunsets. One day he saw 44 of them. What?
Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is. I have an idea. We just need... My plane!
He makes a pretty good living hustling college kids and tourists. He's helped me out a lot in the past. - Did you sleep okay? Yeah. You got to adapt, like water.
He's helped me out a lot in the past. - Did you sleep okay? Yeah. You got to adapt, like water. You put water in a glass, it becomes a glass.
- Did you sleep okay? Yeah. You got to adapt, like water. You put water in a glass, it becomes a glass. You put it in a bottle, it becomes a bottle.
- What? Juicy. But who was this person? I mean, who lets four homeless people just move into their house? No!
Quotes are usually short. So are dicks, but sometimes you hit the jackpot. Keep reading. "And some sisters live their lives in chaos, like a goddamn tornado," "so the other sister has to clean it up all the time."
President Coin, we're indebted to you for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay. But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2 knows what we've been up against. This is The Nut. The Capitol's headquarters for all offensive operations. It's manned by both military and civilian personnel from District 2.
We have discovered that by using emotional cues we can teach them primitive belief systems. Of course, it's only because they are not yet capable of higher logical thought. Where is the creature now? Dead. Poor thing.
- Hey. This it? - Si. Try not to get yourself killed, kid. Bodhi, I can't see the line. Nothing. I do.
Big world. Why would you? Big wave rider like you? I watch YouTube. I just never seen you.
Is this for real? There are 100 engineers walking around here. None of them have the tools? In fairness, not many of them were issued the tools. What about you?
- An operating system? - Yeah. What do you mean? Well, the OS is what runs the computer. In fact, it sort of is the computer.
How has it been running? How's it gonna run this morning? What do you mean, you don't have an OS? It's like this. Avie Tevanian is our Chief Software Designer, and he wrote a demo program. It's like we built a great car, but we haven't built the engine.
Do not fear. You are among friends. We are the resistance. We don't believe in the barbaric consumption of other species. So, what do you eat-- space broccoli? Space broccoli has the most advanced feelings of any creature in the universe.
And you pull those warm pink polka-dot sheets all the way up to your eyes. And you hug all your stuffed animals. Puffy Bear, Duck Duck, Cathypillar. Kissing them good night. And you can feel the fan on your nightstand blowing a soft breeze through your hair.
That's bullshit. I could have cut that guy a check. Really? But would you have? Eddie, I get that you're disappointed.
Kind of like a cybernetic stomach. All though not really, it's not an analog or anything. So it serves as a power source? It's not like Mr. Fusion. A Back to the Future fan.
That's why Castle chose you for this article series. He really enjoyed your paper on Subsumption Architecture. That was my dissertation. My unfinished dissertation. I never technically defended it.
Speaking of security, have there been any other trouble with, you know...? The magazine? No. Legal has them dead to right on confidentiality. And technically she did steal hardware.
The Kartenhoff. The oldest in human possession. The very meteorite which made this crater. Think about it. So many years up there, alone, silent, building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth. A huge, unstoppable force.
Try the Hoffler Klinik. You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond. So long. I can't deny I'm impressed you got H.M.G. to cough up for all this. Good God, the government couldn't afford this kind of facility. No, it was benefactors mostly, from the private sector.
And he didn't bring you in? Even after you gave him the disk? You knew perfectly well it was blank. That's a lie. The disk she took from me was an exact copy, I'm sure of it.
You were certain we would end up where we are... right now. Then again. So was I. I know you, Lane. Somewhere along the line you had a crisis of faith.
Mommy wants to give aunt Abby a present. sunshine? - Yeah - With mommy? I'll see if I can re-arrange with Abby. Thank you.
This is a domestic matter for Austria. It has no place in the American courts. Thank you, Mr. Gould. Mr. Franks, representing the United States government. Your opening statement, please.
Coincidence. Four years later, these girls have grown up a little bit, and we have Ponytail. Tobi's a very important part of your life. Right? Okay-
Well, I don't really care what the burro wants. Get out of my bank, you beast! I know what you're thinking, but not yet. Hold it. How is this jackass stuck?
And I will do everything I can to help... but first you need to tell us all you know. That sounds very scary. You must be so brave. General... I regret to inform you... but this map recovered from BB-8... is only partially complete.
This was the Death Star. And this is Starkiller Base. So, it's big. How is it possible to power a weapon of that size? It uses the power of the sun.

Even when those brothers gave us those magnifying glasses and we saw those fleas pull that little stagecoach right into the depot or roll those cannons, those tiny little cannons onto the battlefield. She said those fleas are dead. They're just glued to some mechanical contraption, you know, that moves on its own like a timepiece or a windup. Still, I thought it was real and I told her, I said, "Don't talk so loud. The performers will hear you."
That wasn't the question! Show us where they are at. We won't be dissuaded. Bring me a map of the western range. We got an old survey map.
Then how come I left you at the saucier, then I find you at the Poisson? - Adam... - I'm not talking to you! How did you turn a beautiful, fresh piece of turbot into a pale, lifeless turbot fuck-all? How the fuck did you do that?
Jaoa says I need to focus on bringing my power into the world. Fuck! Maybe I can help. You... are a great man, James King. Do me on the new house.
We tried a lot of different ways of making a film for you but they were all too goofy or irrelevant or just not what we wanted. So, now I'm gonna talk to you directly. Um... All right, I'm gonna be honest here. Okay? Sometimes, white girls are particularly stupid. I mean, everybody's stupid, but white girls, you know...
And because it's acid, these crocodiles are just pissed. And they're also piping in that gross smell you get when they spill a bunch of milk in the school parking lot. And this beefy torture dude is just punching the hell out of him. check. All right, look. I'll just start.
It's impossible. Why not? I've got an optical-overlay network that's got to be up in 17 days. They sent me some code tonight. The black hat who hit the Chai Wan reactor.
We're all waiting for you. Please call me. She's gonna come. Don't worry. Can you believe these girls?
I got all the girls that most fit the description on the video. They're all here? All but four. So one of them is the dead girl from the hotel. And the others are our thieves.
"I don't cling to life sufficiently to fear death." Dad. Time to go. Really? Excuse me, ladies. Mmm. Mmm.
What's this? What? What's going on? Oh, you're asking questions now? No. I told you once I set the deal, the deal doesn't change.
You've always been coherent with the idea of social cinema... Mom! Mom, help me! What? Rhetoric bothers me. Those banners that friends and relatives put up.
Well, have it your way, Fang. One million pounds. I trust that you have brought the treasuries? I think I'll keep the money. And the vase. You cheated me in our last deal.
[ Chuckles ] [ Siren walls in distance ] _ I want whatever's left of the car transferred here. We're taking over the investigation. I can't believe they waited a day and a half to call us.
People may think that because me and my friends work naked, we're slags. But you know we're not. I spend a lot of time naked at home, but that's just me being me. That's when I feel myself. Just because girls dress in a more revealing way than you doesn't make them slags.
With azam Ghol and this... this Nizar. All right. Just give me the gory details. Richie, shut up. Listen to me.
A little birdie told me that the CIA had struck a deal, letting Mossad borrow an incredibly talented and creative entry specialist. She, for, yes, indeed, it was a woman, was the very best in the world at penetrating the most impenetrable places, and then, poof, disappearing without a trace. I'll admit. The story has always fascinated me. It's heroine and it's, it's ultimate tragedy, for her blast did not kill its intended target.
You know, money's fine, except when it's motivated by greed. You're a little firecracker when you get riled up, aren't you? I think it stopped raining. Firecracker? Is that how you regard women with an opinion?

Like, even... Like, they might love to read it if you wrote it down, seriously. Do something really real with it. You know what skives me out, Pheebs? What? That car down there has moved so much.
What? That car down there has moved so much. Like it was built in a factory, you know, on a production line. And then it was like shipped, like, here. And like, then this guy drove it all over the place. Yeah, exactly.
Thinking about it. Your message said you had something to tell me. They've put surveillance on Ruth's grave. You can't go there any more. I have something which, by rights, should be yours. Your father was wearing it the night he died.
My balls are fucking shrinking from the cold, you son of a fucking bitch! Hello! Yeah! Okay, good job, guys. Good job.
It was adorable. Well, it's nice to know chivalry isn't dead. Susan, would you mind walking me around the space? Of course. My pleasure.
One night, the king's son, the fairy prince, found his way onto Blackbeard's ship. Her name was Mary, the love of Blackbeard's life and his most prized possession. Night after night, the prince visited Mary. But when Blackbeard discovered them, he flew into a jealous rage. So in order to save her, the prince took human form.
One more week until school starts. Gotta enjoy my last few days of sort-of freedom. (Chuckles) Just when I'm weighing my relationship with George, my daughters tell me they want things to go back to normal. Well, that's understandable.
Just when I'm weighing my relationship with George, my daughters tell me they want things to go back to normal. Well, that's understandable. Look at the year they've had... Cancer, lesbianism. What kind of mom would I be if I dropped another bombshell on them right now?
Yeah, more than fine. I actually think some... Some good may have come from it. Do I want to hear this? It got me thinking about your father and how I've been repressing a lot of anger. Really toxic stuff.
I need to get Antoine Tyler out of this hospital now. It needs to happen without anybody knowing. Okay, well, he's a sick kid. Where do you propose to put him? Henry Maxson was scheduled to go to Ansley Surgical Center, but the hospital doesn't know that.
You never let me do anything. I wanna go pick new flowers for my mom. - If you're afraid, I'll go myself. - Can't go out. Can't go outside. Those things...

It's a baby. Claire, that's a fairy hill. That baby is no human child. That's a changeling. What the hell are you talking about?
My poor Jamie, trapped in a loveless marriage, forced to share his bed with a cold, English bitch. He must have to get himself swine drunk of a night before he can stand to plow yer field. I shouldn't have done that. Sorry. Aye.
You heard me. What do you hate about your job? Plucking of these flowers. Whether it's for humans or God. These flowers are so delicate.
And this is the first time this place has seen light. But...how did you manage all this in so little time? We did it together, sir. Otherwise it would've not been possible. But the idea was yours.
It lacks something. Can you tell me what's missing? There are no dried leaves here. According to me, Mr. Ruparel, a garden that doesn't have a few dried leaves, some withered flowers, doesn't seem real. This place is too beautiful.
His guilt condemns him. Cut him down for me, expertly. As if he were a bird in flight. Don't pinch it! Where's it going?

What did you expect to get from it? Food. Come. They wanted to flog you. I managed to dissuade them, but it was not easy.
So, uh, what do you think of the other girls so far? They're sweetie pies. It's so fun to have a big group. - Uh-huh. - This is nothing. Um, hey, is there a reason that you're doing that thing with your voice?
Okay, I'm sorry, but I thought... I thought that she broke up with him. Yes, well, apparently not, okay? We need to get ahead of this. And you know what those girls are gonna do if they find out that he's still in touch with his Pippa Wannabe.
No, no, no. Mnh-mnh. Depressed? Yeah, I could barely move. Why didn't you call me, Rach? Because depressed people don't call.
I can't. Why? Why? Why? 'Cause I know how things start with you.
- Hey, Chet, what are you doing? - Stop pushing my leg! - More than you know! Ah, as much shit as I give you, Rachel, I love you for it. You know something, I really don't like this.
Hey, lovers, leave a message. Get me a towel. I think I'm gonna be sick. Got it. "Follow us and they die.
The morning sickness... it lasts all day. It's killing me. Is it wrong to say that I am not looking forward to going through it all again? Ugh, of course not.
Gonna fly out next week, check it out. Denver? Relax. It's just an interview, which is why we weren't gonna tell anyone yet. - Oh, right. I forgot that part. - Mm-hmm. It's a car.
I hope it isn't too rich. I always dine so modestly at home. I won't, thank you. Thank you. We've met before, you know?
- You need to walk away from this. - Walk away? This venture is on shaky footing. How long before the street realizes this? How long before the mob is outside your door again?
But now I fear they cannot see that by supporting him, they may be sowing the seeds of their own destruction. Mr. Meeks, your men can't possibly be that stupid. Are they unaware of the profits he cost them with the Good Fortune prize? Or the future profits he's costing them with me? Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my footing on this subject.
And what if I can get you back on the water with a crew? Would I still only seem indispensable then, too? One of the girls has a lead? Mm, but which one? They're so mistrustful of male authority figures.
So how is everything coming along? How's your speech? Do you need any good jokes for it? The ice drill's en route. - Really? - Mm.
Yeah, I know, you're right. I can do it. I can lie. I can lie everyday for the rest of my life. That's how much I love Joe. Yeah.
That's how much I love Joe. Yeah. You know what? In this light it doesn't look half bad. It's unique. It makes a strong statement, it has a beauty all of it's own.

Nurse Gilbert, you're back on midwifery, there are three delivery packs to be dropped off and a home inspection. I beg your pardon. Sister Julienne led me to believe the morning lists would be my responsibility.
She was hard-pressed to keep me and Dolly looking nice, but she made a point about ribbons. Even during the war. Blue for your sister, and yellow for you. Cigarette? I don't care for smoking in the shop.
You will be collecting information. You will be gathering intelligence about the enemy. The intelligence you gather could give us the upper hand... in a full thermonuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. Or it could prevent one. For public purposes, as far as your wife or mother. Or, sweetheart, the good Lord, your mission does not exist.
What? No. But there will be some whisperings and there may be some bitchy comments written on the toilet walls. Well, whatever. The gay genie is out of the gay fucking bottle.

According to Chinese mythology, one of the most dreadful punishments in the 18 levels of hell involves having one's tongue ripped out. It's considered to be one of the most horrific forms of torture.

I figured he was someone she knew. Why would you think that? Walk away. John. Because he knew my name. Go ahead, Garcia.
But the one rule I ask you abide while you're here is stay in human form. And don't involve the girls in this. Wait, that's two rules. put on some clothes. Were you not paying attention last night?
If they so much as even scratch the paint on my car. Why don't you just be grateful sheriff Forbes was able to track down the car after you let them, uh... You know, steal it from you. Remind me to send her some mini-muffins. Do we really need 10 gallons of gas or are you making me just lug this around as punishment?
I should have turned my back on you ages ago! It's gone. What? The pain. The pain is gone.
I already don't like you. I wanted my night-night cocoa in my special seagull mug-- Now I hate you. And my aunt Charity, who was babysitting because everybody else was in Europe at the dressage competition... Now I've beat you up and left you for dead.

We're not cliches. Cam's decorating the party with photos of Lily dressed as different starlets from the-- w-we--we're cliches. Hey, Gloria, look what I found in my bowling bag. Second place prize in last year's tournament-- A spa day.
I have to buy diapers, I have to go pick up the stroller, I have to go to the doctor. I hate wasting this, but... I just don't have any time today. Yes, I would have loved to go to the spa, but having a baby has changed completely the way that Jay's family look at me. I am not anymore just Gloria that has her hair done, Gloria that goes to the gym. Now I am Gloria the new mother-- the "I don't know how she does it" lady.
My perfect angel! You got this. You're good. You know, Gloria, do you remember that chafing dish I lent you a couple months back that you returned with a chip in it? Every time that Luke comes over, he takes things out of the attic and leaves them just... everywhere! Oh.
And we have to examine it without contamination. Is that the boat that was on fire? My brother saw it when he was out with his pots. Erm... It's too early to talk about specific types of evidence.
Your Graces, I come direct... directly from London. Your husband... the King... Imprisoned, imprisoned in the Tower, I know. And how heavy were our losses at Barnet? Very.

Ha, ha! It's not even that cold in my fridge. But you will be back on Friday? Yeah, that's the plan. Of course things might change.
Ah, yes, you were, weren't you? And you can't be in two places at the same time, can you? Therefore - logically - seeing as you're the killer... Mr Powell must have been killed at a different time. A fact that I was able to prove about ten minutes ago when I found the murder weapon. in the bedroom above the study.
Moaning about how hot it is! Of course it's hot! You've got a woollen suit on! Or with the motorbike, he would hold on so tight like that. It was like Wallace and Gromit. His knuckles were white.
So, you found your wart cream? Which, as I'm sure you know, contains one very useful active ingredient - silver nitrate. Yeah, of course I knew. OK, go on - how does this experiment work? Well, the silver nitrate impregnates the soft paper and reacts with the sweat in the fingerprints to form silver chloride.

Right, okay. How did Deanna break her leg? I'm guessing that showed up in her autopsy report. It's odd that there's no mention of it in her medical records. It was an accident.
And then there's this miraculously healed hand injury. Wait, Brick would not fake a hand injury... no way. That is not like him. No, it's not. Later, Tucker. Okay, look, Shelby is worried.

But he seemed very angry with her. Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist? Yeah, I most definitely could. Well, I know who the killer is. Did you see how that gorilla looked at me?
Well, he said he had a buzz on per usual, but he was pretty drunk. I know I'm alive because he did the scene. I shouldn't complain, it's just that... It feels like I should've stopped him. Well, do you think him being drunk influenced his decision to do the stunt himself? It clouded his judgment, but the decision to do the stunt, that didn't come from Vince.

I did say that. Which means you got no case. No, no, no, we have a deal in place, Mr. Reid. You said I could reject that offer even if I wrote down a statement... right? That's right, she did say that.
Come on, Danny. I can't believe we brought him. I can't believe he won that wet pants contest at Señor O'Callahan's. Don't worry. A bris is a great lie.
Scare 'em straight. Like that time we took Max to that prison and scared all those inmates into getting their lives together. - Tough love. - Let's do this. And here is the grand dame herself-- center court.
In the interest of conducting a civil discourse, the fat slob from Illinois has the floor. Thank you. Now you guys remember Chase, right? Yes. Super cool guy, vowed to ruin your life.
The Angel Tablet. I won't hurt Dean. Kill him. We're family. I have to protect this tablet now.
You killed his mother. You think she was a good mother? I think she did her best. She was a deranged slut. Do you know why Paul was in that wardrobe?
We collect gravel, shale. Sell it where we can. Hebrews? You would sell the very soil if you could. Does soil have any value?
And that's because I can't plot where the wind will blow. I have to let it take me where it wants to go. And you know, a lot of times, I end up someplace way, way cooler than I had ever, ever expected. The wind has literally pushed me in new directions. Some people, they prefer to stay on the ground.
He's still inside. Weird-looking guy showed up, ranting that he had to hide from the voices coming from the dome. I said I had a gun, but he wouldn't leave, so I fired off a couple shots to scare him off. Except you hit your neighbor. And that freak didn't even run off.
( crying, laughing ) Of course I remember it. Your Majesty. You look pale. Paler than usual.
Warlow. His blood might work. No, Eric, listen. Listen. Everything the Book of Lilith has said has been true.
Not if we can help it. We'll know if he makes a move. We've got ears to the ground, and, maybe, accidentally, Trojan-horse style listening apps on his phone? You bugged Parsons? We shared an elevator.
Where? I'm telling you, Steve, gay bars... best place to meet women! I love this music! Yeah! It's hot in here!
I had him, Jack. Right there, dead to rights. I couldn't pull the trigger. I wanted to, but... I couldn't do it. 'Cause that's not how I raised you.
Nolan, you don't have to listen to her. You can talk. I don't know about this, charlie. I feel a little creepy installing a tracking program On our daughter's phone. Look, if we're replacing her phone, we might as well.
Is this what you did with Ali to copy her face? Yes, that's right. So you used her for Joan of Arc, but what about the mask? Well, that was Alison's idea. She asked me to make them.
Uh, just get it later. I'm gonna go conk out. Thanks for the dance. I felt awful, Ida. These women don't make that much.
No. I'm not. You're worried that I'll hurt her again. You're 2-for-2. Would you believe that I've changed? Not you, Mr. leopard.
Did you talk to him? He's agreed to a settlement. But only in exchange for a graceful end to this situation. Are you leaving? Oh, I've got a meeting.
Hi there, Brick. How's my favorite class historian doing? Actually, there's been a little hiccup with the photo montage, but the good news is, you'll have an extra 15 minutes to play with at the assembly. Oh, well, these things happen. (Chuckles) Oh, I knew you'd understand.
Dinner is not quite ready yet. Do you want something to drink or... ? Is everything ok? Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any chores for me. Chores?
I don't want to be some half-assed version of a dad. You're not a half-assed version of a dad. I know, but you know what I mean. You guys know she just got out of juvie, right? Kelsey, I told you not to tell anyone.
Overtime... with me... tonight. I'm not late! Oh, I say you are. It's nothing personal. I just go by the bell.
There's another lie. Why, have you seen it? No, I haven't seen it! I never want to see it. Have you seen your father's penis?
They found that judge up on the Bridge of Americas last night. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I saw that. It's just terrible. Well, I don't know.
You've heard of voodoo economics. This is voodoo math. They're making crazy assumptions to inflate their value. Just like Kelo, but that really didn't seem to bother you when it was in your favor. Your Honor, this is ludicrous.
Mm... it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door. Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies. I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns Ammo.
But doesn't gratin imply grilled food? Yes. But the potatoes get grilled with the cream. I see! So you cook them with any potatoes.
- but I haven't. - I paid for what I did. Not for killing Regina. I didn't kill Regina and you know that. And how would I know that?
But you just said... I believe Pelant wants us to believe it is a complex code, but it's actually quite simple. What kind of bullets were the victims shot with? Copper jacket, lead core. You see these two slit-like exit wounds in the scapula?
Arizona... was nice enough to lend me some scrubs. Thank you, by the way. You're a lifesaver. This place looks so different in the dark. You think the tree ruined my couch?
The responsibles would then be those managing the pipes that transport the content. Just as if the postman was responsible for the mail he carries. Rafi Haladjian, founder of francenet, was one of the two CEOs arrested that morning. The issue with pedophilia is that it's an easy topic. Pedophilia is the only unambiguous topic...
I was held responsible for the 47,000 websites that were hosted on my servers. As I couldn't take on this responsibility, I only had one choice which was to shut down the whole hosting service. Which means that several hundreds, several thousands of small companies, non-for-profit organizations, information services today no longer exist because I cannot carry on this responsibility of hosting contents that might be criminal. But it does not work everytime, Rafi Haladjian made it through. As long as a judge hasn't ruled that this content is illegal it is not the job of people who are nothing, namely Internet service providers, to adjudicate on this content.
She's in a coma. Intracranial pressure from her head wound is increasing. Anything on the weapon? She was hit with a wooden object. It left splinters, had a thin edge.
Jenna, Ryan! Hey, Margot. Nice work. What? I said, "Nice work." In your garden. Wait, hang on, I'll come over.
I didn't forget. All the centuries we've spent together and yet I can count on one hand the number of times that our family has been truly happy. I hated leaving here. Are you aware that the witches can't leave here? They practice ancestral magic, they draw their power directly from their dead in those cemeteries.
It's only Costa Rica. I'll be back before you know it. Oh, that's--that's sweet, but, no, it's not about that. It's, uh... something your grandmother told me. There comes a point in our lives when we have to stop fooling ourselves into thinking life's gonna be the way we want it to be.
Much like Erika. Too soon. Hey, guys. I got something. That phone call that she made to her friend to arrange lunch had me wondering exactly where that call came from.
There's a lot of people who live back in the, in these woods and, uh, they just don't like other people into their business here. Like who? Oh, like, uh, uh, pot farmers and, river people, locals, uh, I don't know, uh, pets and people go missing all the time here. But you had mentioned to me earlier, um, when you were telling me this story that you had the feeling that, that it might have been something, a Bigfoot.
So, I was out in, out in the woods with my, my dog, Bella, a beautiful girl. She was a golden retriever, and, uh, well, she, she took off in the woods and, uh, and I called, called for her to stop and, uh, she didn't, you know. She just kept going and, uh, which is weird, because usually, she's very obedient. And, uh, so I went in the woods after her. I was, I was calling and calling and, uh, nothing, you know.
It just got fleas. You think he's dirty? Keep digging. Captain Cragen? I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Parker, but you didn't answer your phone.
I hired an independent investigator to examine the lab's processing of my client's case. As you can see, under pressure, the lab tech compromised the process by testing my client's DNA sample in the same tray as the forensic sample. There is a possibility of cross-contamination. I need to authenticate these documents, I-- Yes, of course.
Yeah, I'm okay. Just those things I said earlier. About Nate? You just said what you needed to say. Those things weren't true.
And just remember one more thing-- I own you. Okay, remember, we get in, get the truck, and get out. We got one shot at this. One shot's all we need.
So you and your boys, you can do this job? I took a look. We crash the gate, we hit it hard. It's no problem. Okay.
But I do want to discuss one thing-- my price, it just went up. - Did it? - Yeah. 'Cause I did some, uh, how do you say? Research.
The consulate opens at 9:00. Don't worry about me. It's my first kidnapping. I'm not exactly in a hurry to start. Well, just follow my lead.
Not everybody walks away a winner. Listen, victory in this town without you by my side is just gonna mean so much less. Woman: Agent Byrne? Somebody help me, please! God, I love the French.
Started believing that badge of his was something he earned. My advice? Do some redecorating. Especially if you plan on sticking around. Savino: Don't worry about the sandwich.
I'm just saying, if we're gonna play "guess the identity of the serial killer," we... we can't just assume things like "he's a thrill seeker." The audience element of his m.O. Indicates a personality type attracted to risk. Or it suggests someone who simply wants attention. Do you think that the victims are connected to each other? No.
Now that the Supreme Court has finally seen fit... [Cheering] It has finally seen fit to recognize that all people are entitled to equal protection under the law and have the right to the same challenges and triumphs, benefits and burdens, as everybody else. I'm very proud to welcome you here to the marriage of my daughter, Lena Elizabeth Adams, to stefanie Marie Foster. And we're honored that you are here to witness this magical event.

Uh, will you excuse me for a minute? What the hell is this? It's my bachelor pad. Pretty nauseating digs, right? This room is supposed to be for storage.
I'm just a little on the husky side. Come on, we're going for a walk. - Pick up the pace, big guy. - "Big guy"? Do you not see this Hawaiian shirt I'm wearing?
Technically, no, but I published a series of articles about the Fen-Phen case in the Stanford Law Review in 2005. - It was very well received. I actually brought a copy with me today. What is that? It's just a... thing.
He's in the building with the bombs... where I left my car keys. We've got 23 minutes until the building goes. We've gotta get Benford. The answers will come. You sound so certain.
Get out! Goodbye! - No no no. - Don't even look back here! Forget about us! Why did you shoo the girls away?
- All right! Then do exactly as I say. Let's go. Wait wait wait. O captain, my captain. Does the red rabbit run faster than the gazelle?
Where were you when you heard they caught that second killer dumping this boy's body? I was in denver working a new case. I wasn't on anything yet. I could have still been there. I won't ignore my gut again.
Yeah. So what is this, Stephie? Is this some mad experiment gone horribly wrong? - Maybe they're doing a movie. - Oh, yeah. I could see that now.
You can't hide. I'll find you. - Damn it. - Where does this channel lead? Where are you going?
I'll find you. - Damn it. - Where does this channel lead? Where are you going? I might be able to head it off before it reaches the river.
To what? Why you should turn me. We're back to that? Look, I wake up every day, and I feel ok, But there's something missing. Like a--like a hole.
- Like I'm going to tell you! I don't believe this! You've been eating my lasagna for 11 years! Actually, the ficus in the dining room has been eating it. - What?
What about my model? No one wants to see a guy come on my show and play with dolls. Okay, first of all, that is not what it is. And second of all, you just had a guy on your show playing with dolls. So, your dolls are favored to win at the Rhinebeck Collector Awards next month.
That's hilarious. Look, there's a baby in there. Babies have been seeing penises for centuries. Ray, here's the thing: Horny clients with disposable income are like fruit.
Sure. You know, Darb, there are a lot of things I know nothing about. I was a horrible student in high school. Barely made it through math but I do know about boys. If there had been a class on boyfriends, I would have gotten an A-plus.
Oh, not my tortilla chips. They're shaped like tiny bowls to hold the salsa. Salsa but no guac? Weak, Jeff. Get out. What? Why?
One more thing, Timmy. Oh, dear God. Sir, that's not me. I know, that's me having sex with the girl on the third floor. You're not the only one who knows how to tenderize the old Danish. Hey. What are you doing?
My cousin comes to me, says there are Serbs hunting men, like us, who could be fighting them. My cousin has a little grocery with a basement that we used sometimes when the bombs came. He tells us to come, so, of course of course, I take my sisters, and we go. It was, um, maybe 20 hours there in the dark underneath the store. Staying very quiet. But our friend Zodya had, um, a baby.
He's serving time for a murder-for-hire. And he's implying that he put a hit out on the commissioner. Murder-for-hire. You didn't tell Pope about this, did you? No. No. I don't want him to do anything too hasty. Believe me, I know exactly what we're up against here.
Now, listen, blink one for yes and two for no." "yeah, all right. Yeah, not too bad. The axe is nice and sharp. You're talking shit again. "you promise to do it?" - ricky: "yeah, I will."
- He sort of ages fast. - Right. So every other week he's having a birthday and stuff. And, yeah, that was weird. He's not having a birthday every other week.
- Thank you. But didn't I tell you I'd fix the tub? You did, and I think I was pregnant with Luke. That is not fair. I've done everything you've asked me to do around here. I fixed the step, didn't I?
'" - It's good that. - All right. - Say it fast. - "If you can't treat a cheerful tramp, - What sort of tramp can you treat? Good, isn't it? Good, that, yeah. You got too much time on your hands, Karl.
And everyone said, "how's a piano doing up here?" And it turned out that some guy-- One of these people who tries to break world records-- Had dragged a piano up there as some kind of feat of endurance And just left it up there. It wasn't anybody tipping or aliens or anything. "some scientists have come up with a cure for bird flu." It's something to do with some stuff in horses.
So if you took the eyes out-- But, Karl, how is this ghostly creature able to function? It-- it doesn't have its head on, anyway. It's carrying it under its arm, So the suspicion is it doesn't need its head. It just happens to be carrying it around
That's asking an awful lot these days. I know. You all submit to a blood test. That's the price of admission. We can do that. You got stuff to bring in, you do it now.
- No no no no! Don't! Wait, no! Hey, Jenner, open that door now. There's no point. Everything topside is locked down. The emergency exits are sealed. Well, open the damn things. That's not something I control. The computers do.
- Okay, you know what? We'll go scope the place out ourselves, all right? - Do your thing. - Yeah, whatever. Notice the two unpaired females.
- Really? - Yes. He's been looking. He says that's what a phone is supposed to be- indestructible and heavy enough to knock someone out. Yeah, that sounds like Seeley.
For a cub, he certainly knows how to take the romance out of things. We're not talking about him. We're talking about you. So, middle-aged women pay you to hook up with younger guys? No, they don't. They pay to go on my cruises.
Fractures to your metatarsals from when you were tortured. Rib pitting from when you foolishly tried to act as a human shield. Rib pitting? And that's before we even get to your compromised ligaments, both intertransverse and interior longitudinal. How do you have room in your brain to remember all that? I care about you, Booth.
The truth. The same thing Donny was hoping for. In all the stories that Leo ever told, this bar historian, what if he saved one story just for Donny? A story that Leo himself could never verify because the trapdoor to the basement wasn't discovered until after he died. When Billy Pitt decided to sell the bar, and T.J. McChucklenuts was going to buy it,
You make it sound like punishment. I've been training my girls for decades not to blend into society but to conquer it -- Here... And around the world. My girls know I'll always be here for them.
And around the world. My girls know I'll always be here for them. And I know they'll never desert me. I do hope you enjoyed the birthday present. That music box brought such comfort to you when you were young.
And I appreciate it. But I'm not going anywhere. We're not gonna let you live here alone. I want to live here alone. Don't you think I'm a little tired of sharing one bathroom with the three of you?
Shahnawaaz was a good boy. God knows what came over him that night that he killed his friend. When is the lawyer coming! A lot of the houses were empty. The CRPF has occupied most of them.
And that won't happen. Hedoesn't know me. But why don't you let him take over since you're... - What am I? - Well, er, you... might want a rest. You know what's good about being old?
I'm gonna say this once. And then I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama. My lack of interest in having a child is not some pathology that you can pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed.
And then I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama. My lack of interest in having a child is not some pathology that you can pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed. I like my life the way that it is.
What about you, Reed? You go for older guys, right? - Was it something I said? - Oh, no, no. It's not you. - What do we have?
How did mary find out? Ike, I know you operate on the theory That every other federal agency is staffed By people who are too stupid to work at the dmv, But in this case you asked for the best inspector I knew. I got her, and guess what, she did her job. No, she stepped into our job thanks to you. You know that last promotion you got?
It's gonna be parents talking. It's gonna be college admissions officers talking. So really think about what you want, all right? What's happening? Where'd you get the car? Friend of mine. Gotta get it back by midnight, you know.
Didn't you? You got engaged. - Is there any language you don't speak fluently? Por favor. Momento.
- Despite my best efforts, It looks like there's still one sucker left in this family Ready to buy whatever eddie r. Last chance. You coming or not? Have you seen a green folder? It was right here on the counter.
She was giving him a massage and he attacked her. Why didn't she bring charges? She was afraid. And four years later, this happens to you? We've only been looking into this a few hours, so there could be more women.
Thank you so much. I don't wanna take up a lot of your time. I just... I could say that I was running because of some grand ideals, but it's really... I have two daughters. And there is this fountain near the courthouse that I used to love.
And he likes video games. Great men like video games. - You think she's lying? - There is a wealth of detail of her entering the room and the massage itself. But when she talks about the assault, it becomes variable.
- All right. - Thank you. I accept your adoration. Thank you, young man, for joining me on the stage. - What is your name? - Tim.
I'm doing this on my own. Then get a table at Denny's, not my conference room. Bill me. You're violating your agreement. Then fire me.
Her parents are in a nursing home, and Josh's folks passed away a few years ago. And Josh was her husband? How did he die? A car accident. Maggie and Riley were in the car, too. Maggie was seven months pregnant with Becky.
Dinner is on me tonight, Liv. Evvia, Pimlico, whatever you want. Big spender. What's the occasion? Olivia saved our lives.
Peter wouldn't be here now if you hadn't. If he continues to investigate... Yes, well, he will continue to investigate Whether you like it or not. Then he will play right into Walternate's hands. I... what do you mean?
It's a hickey. You never seen a hickey? No, I have. Eew! Weird! I thought women our age didn't give hickeys anymore.
This crow is eating me alive! Frank, you are sick... because you ate rancid, maggot-filled meat, not because of animals. And, Dee, you've got to set that rabbit free. - Really? - Yes!
- Charlie, you got some cash? - Uh, no. Shit. Check your front pockets. What are you doing?
Whoa! Aw, man! Oh, dude. - All right, that's it. I'm calling Dennis. - No. Don't you understand?
Trust me. You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret and you expect me not to ask questions? - I can't say anything more. It's just better for you if I don't. You ever find that moonstone?
I know Elena's at... I know Elena's at home. I need you to deliver a message. What was the message? Tell Damon and Stefan that I want the moonstone
What? I mean, last time she didn't even know who I was and she was so upset. The doctors said... Well, I know what the doctor said, but she's been asking about you a lot. - Really? - Yeah.
You went away, Justin, because you needed to. And you grew up so much. I need that now. This is my chance. I have to go.
I have to confess that I have never managed to keep a houseplant alive longer than three days. It's nice. Tonight was a bloodbath. In this one day, this seemingly ideal relationship just came crashing down around us. And it reminded me that life is about buying the damn plant.
All your perceptions in this case were shaped to support that theory. Why would you allow this to happen? It's part of my new thesis. First impressions, false perceptions. Because of it, I just got accepted to Eastern Florida University.
"God, who is that gorgeous girl?" You want to own it. You want to feel that way inside. I like to remember my mother just like this. Not the way she looked at the end in the hospital.
Maybe. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. She told you that all those years ago. You heard it and you have never forgotten it. Honestly, I don't know why That particular detail came into my head.
I simply thought that we could make some associations. Associations? Can you tell me... Can you tell me a little more about the animal that you saw in the dream? You said that you weren't quite sure whether it was a goat or a dog.
Beyond the street there was a forest of thick black trees. And a woman with long dark hair came walking out of the forest. She wore a long white gown, bright as the moon. And I was standing over my son. And as the woman started walking towards the house, I was trying to hold my son's arm.
Drill heads, pipeline joints, seams and welds, They began to form leaks and cracks, then ruptures. My team were brought in from Novorossiysk. The machine house... imploded. All along the pipeline, we found leaks and ruptures. That was the accommodation block.
- Not without an F.B.I. Escort. Agent Harris. You said to call if there was trouble. You wanna be a little more specific, Westen? Few incidents... inspire a police response as intense as a prison break.
- Family too... - Hey, is that your mom again? - If you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael. As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
- Simon? - Surprised to hear from me? Where are you? Right behind you. The end won't come that quick.
Take me. It's my fault. Suit yourself. Clock is ticking. You don't always have to rely on trained operatives... to gather intelligence.
Can't rush a guy like Tony Soto. Billy called three times. Rivera's on his way to their shop. Where's my car? Stolen.
And neither will Mr.Slicey. So, check this out. I cross-referenced the documents we got at the docks, Figured out which shipment belonged to our boy cobra. Cobra -- that name... Live with it.
They've seen your face, Jesse. I need to get ears on them. Okay, so you're gonna bug a bunch of wiseguys? Good luck with that.They'll be looking for it. Trust me, I can handle it.
What does it say in the Good Book, Nick? Science has a way of revealing other truths about vampires. Like... your acute sensitivity to sunlight. It's actually a symptom of a medical condition called porphyria. Even... brief exposure to sunlight can cause your skin to... burn... and blister.
We only want to understand what's going on. You want to understand? Let me show you. I don't see any evidence of any kind of explosive device in there. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but water's not supposed to blow up like that.
I don't see any evidence of any kind of explosive device in there. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but water's not supposed to blow up like that. Wasn't there a river in Ohio a long time ago that was so polluted that it caught on fire? The Cuyahoga, just outside of Cleveland. You know, I had a cousin who lived there.
[Stokes] Really? What about the hot springs, last night? No. According to the system, the last trip started in Cable Springs around Main Street and ended just around Fremont and Nordling where the cops found it. Positive for blood. Expended nine millimeter cartridge casing. Ejector and extractor marks are consistent with a Beretta, or a Taurus semi-auto.

The question was the police now believe that the bombing was an inside job. That the bomb was hoisted up through a dumbwaiter... Objection. Again, not in evidence. It is in the investigative report.
Ray Langston is a murderer. About five years ago, my wife was writing a piece on the Angel of Death at Delaware General Hospital. 27 patients were murdered by injection of ethylene glycol into their I.V.'s. Langston was a pathologist at the hospital... and a very helpful source to Heidi. At first.
In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm took a major role in getting a bill passed that pretty much exempted derivatives from regulation. They are unifying markets, reducing regulatory burden. I believe we need to do it. It is our very great hope that it will be possible to move this year on legislation that, in a suitable way goes to create legal certainty for OTC derivatives. I wish to associate myself with all the remarks of Secretary Summers. NARRATOR: In December of 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.
All right, love. Will you find who did this? Yes... ..we will. When? And why are the girls out there in the first place?
It actually makes a lot of sense because you're taking the energy system, the power system, off of the vehicle and locating it remotely. Electricity... power tools... mega-machinery... And the ability to explore the heavens... Have these technologies been available for just the past few centuries?
So the chemicals actually come in through the shafts into the queen's chamber, and then they combine and mix and hydrogen boils off. The hydrogen is then lighter than air and it will flow into all the upper chambers. The energy from the earth is then vibrating the whole pyramid. The vibrations are picked up in the Grand Gallery. So I proposed the Grand Gallery was a resonator hall and there are 27 pair of slots that actually go up the length of the gallery and then the resonators were mounted in there vertically.
Today, it is used as a fuel to launch rockets into space. And if, thousands of years ago, the Great Pyramid was actually producing hydrogen, that would make it one of the earliest power plants known to man. The Giza power plant theory is essentially the drawing of energy from the Earth through the Great Pyramid, and converting that energy into microwave energy. So the chemicals actually come in through the shafts into the queen's chamber, and then they combine and mix and hydrogen boils off.
The very first power station was built by Nikola Tesla at Niagara Falls. You've got to have some sort of power that's spinning the rotating fields, and in this case would be water. So every obelisk would have had to have had a power station similar to like the one at Niagara Falls. It's generating power, but the obelisk itself is putting the power into the atmosphere, making it useable. And this is similar to Christopher Dunn's theory of the Giza power plant because he believes that the Great Pyramid was actually sending a microwave beam to a satellite that was in orbit around the planet.
There are a wide range of benefits that can be derived from accepting that we have neighbors in the galaxy that are visiting us. There are reports of medical treatments that have been performed for the benefit of several people who have had contact. There are advanced energy technologies. Reports are that some ofthese have been reverse-engineered already and are used in military craft. There are communications technologies.
And then, as a planet goes around that star, when the planet gets in front ofthe star, the starlight dims, just a little bit, from our vantage point, because it's being blocked by the planet. And so, you look for that dimming ofthose stars. And then that's how you're able to detect these planets. NARRATOR: So far, the Kepler telescope has confirmed the existence offive planets outside our own solar system. NASA officials expect to find several hundred more exoplanets like these before their mission is completed.
NARRATOR: Using his equation, Drake estimated that over 100 million advanced civilizations could exist in just the Milky Way galaxy. BIRNES: SETI presupposes that ifyou've got an alien civilization capable oftraveling that's developed electronics, they have a fingerprint. That fingerprint is a repetitive signal.
One of his greatest legacies is the Great Wall of China. When the land is prosperous, he decides it's time to go, and the great yellow dragon comes back and he gets back into the belly of the dragon and flies off forev. Now, were these dragons truly dragons in a biological nature? Or were they misinterpreted types of machines? Because, as we all know, dragons are always correlated with spewing fire and a lot of smoke.
HANCOCK: Crick didn't feel in that period of roughly 600 million years, from the formation of the planet down to the time when the planet could first support life, there was enough time for DNA to evolve by accident. It's an enormously complicated molecule. Crick gave this analogy: You would be more likely to assemble a fully functioning and flying jumbo jet by passing a hurricane through a junkyard than you would be to assemble the DNA molecule by chance in any kind of primeval soup in five or six hundred million years. It's just not possible. But if this molecule could not have evolved accidentally, how was it created?
Please sit. I'm glad to see you. The pleasure is mine. Well, I saw a windmill in front of your house. Yes.
Forced entry? -No. Were there rolling blackouts last summer? Oh, just about every year. Anything like this happen?
She'll meet you up on deck. Gentlemen. I did it! Did what? I busted through the back door of Agent Macy's encrypted laptop.
A coffee maker... coffee cups... these ones and others, even extra glasses for guests. Cutlery for six people, a sugar jar, two salad bowls, small, large etc... An iron, which I was impressed with, a hairdryer, a broom, a dustpan to collect the dirt, a mop and floor cloths, I was impressed with that too. They're little details one wouldn't expect to find.
Since I live in such a big country, everything is far: education, food, health, housing. My country is so big that justice doesn't extend to all. There is an abuse of power and greed for natural resources. We are the children of a planet, a planet that we are depleting with wars and everything.
I'm pretty sure upstairs Is the headquarters for the dragon triad. I think they might be hiding the girl there, But that's not important right now. Not important? Gus, I kicked a board in half. - No, you didn't. - You're right.
Maybe killed Mike Franks. Dead or alive, are his whereabouts still undetermined? I did retrieve .45 caliber slugs from that shootout in Mexico. It's Mike Franks' weapon of choice. Yeah, I'm gonna go double stack the drawers.
Plane's gonna be moving soon. And here, Bell's personal cell phone. Look at the time stamps on these calls. Dead men don't make phone calls. Someone else is using his phone... perhaps the, uh, elusive J.P. Dean.
I hit the White Zin hard. I promise you, I was sober as a judge. Let me ask you this, if Toby wasn't abducted last night, what happened to him? Maybe he left when you weren't looking. His car is still in the driveway.
Once I've changed completely, the Colonel will see me as a threat. - Will it be you? - I came to ask for your forgiveness. I forgive you, Ronald. That looks like our shuttle.
I was wrong about that. I was misled. Possibly. There's no other explanation for it. This ship has demonstrated the ability to mess with people's minds.
Okay, I guess I was going to tell you sooner or later. Adrian thought that she was pregnant. Wait, you and Adrian thought you were pregnant? Yeah, but we're not. What made you think you were pregnant?

"V. White Associates." Come on. Be nice! Are you having trouble? This machine doesn't like old bills.
Iceland as an example was 100 years ago dependant on peat and things like that no real natural resources and then they were kind of stuck in that sense but they have abundant geothermal and hydropower and that really has kind of freed them in that sense from this dependency that I think a lot of countries are really stuck with. But even such a trivial thing as getting richer we should look at renewables as a new source of a good business this can speed up the process putting aside all of the important things like fossil fuels running out or the global warming, why not money? That's also a good starting point for investing in renewables. Money is Green Yay!
Every week I'm meeting some people who are in the same situation and have stopped paying the bank. I'm afraid that we will be hitting some real tipping points in the next 10 or 20 years and therefore we need to look at what we need to change the Western civilisations need to cut their consumption. We throw away 99% of the stuff we buy within 6 months and now that we are running out of metals and materials we need to make all of our gadgets we need to learn to make things that are more durable and we can repair I think a lot of re-skilling is necessary, so we learn to grow our own food and repair things and make our own clothes and so on.
Iceland has been missing a clear vision for what we like to stand for and how we see ourselves in the World Just making new Smelters, for export of Aluminium is very easy and that's why I feel it is very important for Icelanders to gather and get an agreement about what we like to stand for. The Ministry of Ideas is partly funded by two of the Universities here in Iceland within that facility apart from the Ministry of Ideas, we have several start up companies that work like a single company in terms of exchanging ideas and helping different companies to get connected with different people within the community and the business community. The goal is to generate 50 new companies in Iceland.
I'll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise. Why? Cos you're not going to do that. Am I not? I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes.
Anyway, I forgive you. - I didn't say I was sorry. - Yeah, but you probably will. I'll just have to wait 20 years and I don't want to be hurt that long so I'm gonna forgive the future you, that delightful person who's gonna come to me and say: "Mom, I'm so sorry I gave you so much crap when I was 16.
Now, what's this? And I love this, a big flashy lighty thing - that's what brought me here. Big flashy lighty things have got me written all over them. Not actually, but give me time and a crayon. Now, this big flashy lighty thing is connected to the spire in your dome, yeah, and it controls the sky.
Oh, great, thanks, Doctor, because there was a real danger we were all going to nod off We've got less than an hour! I know. Doctor? How are you getting us off here? Oh, just give me a minute!
Sirs... We do not think it right and proper that the Earl should be condemned for such... trifles. - Sir Christopher, whenever has innocence been cause to save a man's life when the King deems him unfit to live in the Commonwealth? - My Lord. This is a trial under law. - Master Hayden, if you did not know it before, then you know it now.
- Good English people. They tell us that some of us are not fit to read the words of our Saviour and Lord. I say to you, I would rather read five lines in the Bible than hear five masses in the temple! - The priest claims to turn the wine into God's blood, and the bread into God's body! But where is the proof? Go and find the proof yourself!
They're ethereal, they're like... Who? Tara? Out in the bush, the best way to survive is to blend in to your surroundings. Make it romantic.
A blister. Excess repeated pressure in a concentrated area causes local heat to build up. The heat forces the separation in the top layer of skin, the epidermis. It's the kind of pressure that's everywhere at the Academy. First-year contemporary exam, we're ready for you now.
So what, did you guys move the body? Yeah, I had to. The boat was filling with water. Pretty old to go boating. Pretty old to even get in a boat. All right, so did somebody just put a tarp over it?
Sweetie? Is that you? More bad news. Wonderful. Listen to this.
Well, your blood work shows that you may have slight big-fat-ginger-uglyitis. Oh, my God. You're such a dick. No, um, you've got AIDS. That's what I thought, and it proved...
One day you may be worthy enough to wield it. Until then you may kneel before it. We march for Macragge. And we shall know no fear! Sergeant Crastor.
Right sweep! Verenor! Left! Cover the angles! Full scan!
That was the charlatka. I thought she said it was traditional. It's in Moscow. Not Moscow - Kiev.
Phoenix '97 Flares dropped by air force jets on maneuvers. Jasper, you know my dad is in the air force, it's his job to know about this stuff. Okay so it never crossed your mind that this thing could be from outer space? I mean look at it; what kind of rock is perfectly spherical?
Fine, if this is the way it has to be, I will prove she is not what she seems. Wow, did not know anyone could annoy Maggie more than me. I don't see anything. Because you are not the one with the flashlight. Huh, pretty impressive array of gyroscopes.
Please don't start shouting. 'Most important, don't take it out on Ruby.' 'I nearly got you killed. 'You aren't safe with me any longer.' What? 'This life is exciting and wonderful.
"Swimmingly," that's a word, isn't it? I mean, that is a word- "swimmingly"? Yeah, it's a... it's a word. You all right? Yeah. I'm really good.
Then, I will ask you again: What are we doing here? Late yesterday, our Computer Crimes Division was able to trace the IP address of the hard drive the perpetrator used to upload most of his videos. Turns out they came from a public access computer at the Saguaro Branch Public Library. I assume that that library is familiar to you.
It's Gibbs. Boss, Malloy's at NATO Headquarters, trying to get permission to set sail. Well, don't let him leave. What? I'm just watching the pheromones ooze from your body. I do not see anything.
It's a specific strain of the Cordyline fruticosa. See, every plant has its own fingerprint, as specific and unique as DNA. This pollen came from. Petty Officer Bick's lung tissue. This helps us how? Pollen is embedded in everything.
Are you all right? You're not sick, are you? Listen... Can we sit? This is serious, isn't it?
It's sick, but it's not impossible. How? And how would she convince anyone that I did it? You took notes when he came back from intelligence briefings. Senator Jarvis had you compare missions estimates with back-of-the-envelope calculations you could find.
What you gonna do? Nobody move! It's true that the situation escalated, but put yourself in our place. We live in difficult times. Removes all, dear!
You want? Whiskey. With or without ice? No. You have Irish whiskey?
Don't--don't start that. I'm not giving up on you. Don't you give up. All right, listen, we have to find this Ruby earring woman. We have to take a new photograph of her young and superimpose it on a photograph of old Myka.
They're keeping a lid on what happened to Isabella for us. You okay? Yeah, I will be when we find this thing. Well, I tested her clothes and jewelry. The artifact definitely wasn't on her.
They say things that are not good: On TV, when the news: we see fires: The TV, the TV is hot: Why do you say that? Because when I see, when I touch the TV, it's already hot:
Mama told me: Mama talked to you about him? Aimé Césaire who died in Martinique: Because I saw the picture when he was dead: Death means, for example, when there is a fish and a boy sees the fish that is dead he says to a papa:
Why? 'Cause he was already dead. Good boy. Good boy. Okay, what do you got? I've got a map... well, part of a map.
I do. And by the way, if you're looking for this... You're welcome to join me. I need a reverse cell lookup on Walker's phone. You four, report to polygraph. I've got the last known location.
- "I never wear fur, but this is an emergency!" - That was during the writers' strike, wasn't it? - Ah! The best six months of my life. - Actually, ms. Chase, I too am in a blizzard of sorts, And I need you to be my bear carcass.
Is anyone else having this issue? But oh, look, if it's the will of the council, then I'll go. All: Aye! Fine! Listen, yaddle, I'm gonna need to borrow your car.
People here always dress deceased women that way. It's the same way girlfriends decorate a happy bride. In the morning, before the wedding, they wash her, wipe her dry and prepare multicolored threads. The bride lies or sits down while her girlfriends crowd around her. They tickle her, make jokes and lots of noise.
They tickle her, make jokes and lots of noise. Then they tie the threads into her pubic hair. That's how tomorrow's wife will go to her husband. And at night he will take the threads from her hair, tie them into a knot and hang them on an alder tree. We were leaving our beloved Neya.
He likes blondes. Maybe you'll have an opportunity. The ride back isn't about sex, Julia. The gold piece around your neck. Is that a recent gift from Victor? He gave it to me Sunday.
- Well, at least he's not a thief. I seem to be missing a 300-year-old bottle of buckthorn mead. You Fae and your funny words. Look at the time. I should be going.
It's all I can think about. If someone took away the person you loved, wouldn't you want them to know how it feels? Be right back. We just pulled this from the shredder in Kent's office. This is Hayes' prototype. Yeah.
and close the door. }She'll be okay. Why don't you just go to the hospital? I will. {\I just...}I want to figure out what happened first.
Where's his money? Somewhere you'll never find it. Whatever. We got all the time in the world, unlike you. I can smell that corpse starting to rot.
Yeah, that and a splintered fragment of the rare wood used to make them. And don't forget the serial number. That's what brought us to you. Those things are rare. And expensive.
I've been trying to locate our missing laptop. There was only one computer Adam was connected to when Sass Dumonde was killed. It has to be hers. Then ping it and find the current location. That's what we've been trying to do.
Hey! Who's gonna pay for my door? Are we close to your holo-diary, baby? This way. My papa's grave. I never did have the heart to tell Mama that Papa ran away, or that he died.
OSCAR: Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. Wait, less matching to appear more rich? The glasses are a little... I liked them.
What else we got? One of the maintenance guys reported his car stolen from the parking lot. We got HPD a description. Well, let's assume Dawkins knows that, too, so he's going to abandon that car. We'll find it.
Okay. Uh... What are they doing in Hawaii? They vacation here every year. Governor? - Thanks.
Okay. Okay. I did slip those girls a roofie last night. Why those girls? Why'd you pick them? I was just doing what I was told.
He leaves a van parked in one of the lots. Okay. Go on. I put the girls in the back. Take the van to Ala Wai and park it by the canal.
Sir. RESTRICTED ACCESS Thank you. What time is it? I brought you the radio.
There was a boat leaving for Europe in a couple of hours. He said that we would be on that boat and he would get me a passport, whatever it took. And what did it take? He killed Lucas North for a passport for you? It all happened so quickly.
Yes, they're the largest party, but they have never been smaller lf you want the job, just take it lf l want the job... You've got to bluff Everyone does it in the corporate world This isn't about qualifications -Men... -Stop it Men pretend to be twice as good as they are in job interviews
What is his real motive? -He says he loves Denmark -Don't we all? I think there's more to it, and I intend to find out what Dan and the boys are looking at the  <hon>images<hoff>
Oh, is she? Oh, don't even think about it. She's not going to be interested in a little prick like you. How do you know? Cos I know women.
The little bastard gets under your skin, doesn't he? Oh, shit. Come on. Where are we going? She's like one of those evil bitch spiders.
If it hadn't been for dr. Magnus's warning, Things would have been much worse. What's the news on the other waves? None good, I'm afraid. Esa satellite imagery indicates both have increased in size, No doubt as a result of passing through shallow water.
We want to know. It's difficult to put into words. Everything fell apart. I felt... Shattered? Yes.
Barney's been "putting the moves" on Ted. Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together. No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB tower. Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?
You know, what Halliburton does for weapons, I want to do for dermabrasion. You know what I mean? I want to be the Pinkberry of plastic surgery. I love that. I love that. I mean, that's one of the reasons I agreed to meet with you today si it seems to me like you and I... we have the same mind for things. What I love about you is that you can open up doors.
Could be from our female companion. Yeah, and I'm thinking the libation of choice was mescal, but get this, okay? I've seen everything in these bottles... worms, spiders, live scorpions... whose venom, by the way, okay, makes this drink an hallucinogenic. Uh, well, I... I... I don't know anything about that. Um, but I've never seen anything like this before, okay?
Sweet. Yeah, this party's gonna rock. All right. Later. Mom, you're gonna talk to the neighbors let them know it might get loud when we start jamming at my party? Mark, I just cleaned. -l know, the house looks great.
- We got it. Phone the neighbours. Wake the kids. Kick the dog. Remember that muddy female boot print outside Tilden's house? Yeah, we found it.
Deb watching here. Both wanting some sort of resolution. But I can only help one. Watching these DVDs, watching it actually happen, is worse than any fucking crime scene. What these women went through,
Detective Batista told me and Mr Harmon that you'd made a mistake, that some animal pickup officer was your sole suspect. He's not any more. - And I was supposed to divine that? - Do you know where he is or not? Detective Morgan, I don't know where this aggression is coming from or why it's directed at me, but a word of caution.
It's a homicide victim I'm supposed to have processed already. I made a mistake, forgot to submit it, OK? Morgan. Dexter, the girls are gone. - I don't know.
There was a story in the news recently where they used a cadaver bone - to replace a cancerous one. - You get my fries. - You paged? - Dr. Knox's sister just put her house on the market.
This is a lot bigger than a baby step. Just do it before I change my mind. You're still here? I had to drop these off before I left. It's medication for your hand.
And I need a new owl. This one stopped nibbling my testicles an hour ago. Hellman, a moment? What the hell is your hot but dingy broad wife up to? Sir, I promise you, I don't know.
Come on. Give me the bag. I wonder who killed him? I do not know. I think there was a mark here.
21 grams. The body weight reported to be lost at the moment of death. The weight of the human soul. That study was dismissed for lack of scientific proof. And however much a soul weighs, I'm more concerned about how it plays out in the living.
Oh, my God! Where are we going to put it? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's the key to our life in the game. The immunity idol is mine, mine, it doesn't belong to anyone else.
Why would someone want to mistreat herself like this on purpose? Maybe more rational people feel this need, I don't know. I only know that when the pain is over, it brings me peace, a sense of calm. I knew you were crazy. I just didn't know how crazy.
I'm a person who needs silence. I need to concentrate. Reading. Writing. Calm down, Julia. The baby won't be born tomorrow.
Both mothers died due to severe blunt-force trauma, and the fathers suffered multiple stab wounds. The children were all strangled. Violence only in the kids' rooms, but no sexual abuse on any of the children. That's odd. Odd comes up right now, because the Bennett father was not just stabbed, he was also...
Selfish son of a bitch. If we are willing to take a risk there's a girl's number on the stall door, and she is available to do anything. No, I already tried it. It's just some high-school kid calling me a homo. Hey, we don't need women.
You designed this? Okay, first off, we are told to stop crying by the age of, like, 3. Then every time an adult male leaves the house, he says: "You're in charge." But deep down inside you know you can't be in charge because you can't even make a sandwich. Then you start to notice girls Who aren't your mom.
- We need him to join us. - Fellows. Fellows, could you let me out? It's been like six days. - You won't go anywhere, Chaos.
He came to us, said: "You know, all these rich white people who can't have babies, they could give a good life to these unwanted ones." But you do realize that selling babies is illegal for a reason. It was supposed to benefit the girls and us. But then Dennis got the triad involved and now we pay them a cut to keep their eyes on the girls.
Relax. I'm not here to stop you. Ah. Right on time. Hello, Henry.
-I want to go home. Me too. Where are you going? The road is that way. To find the girls.
With all these traps and guns, I'd rather get back to the road. And away from your stink. Come on, chill! Hate me when we get back. Come on.
And it transforms completely into air... without any... outside assistance! It's late. Come on, tomorrow we will carry out further analysis on the remaining samples. And if we still cannot classify it... you should start thinking about what you are going to name it. The meteorite has also gotten smaller.
They are sitting over there. Why do you ask? Nahum? Nahum? Frau Gärtener?
Perhaps God doesn't love us any more? Cut it out. Both of you. It will pass. To bed with you both!
Okay, that's it, I'm finished. What are you talking about? I'm... I'm finished. I'm done. It's over. Clearly, I am not meant to be a writer. I have tried and I have tried, and nothing has worked out.
It's gravy! I can't believe it. It's brown and not fizzing. It's amazing what not adding butterscotch, pickle juice, or fresca will do. Give me the ring.
I can't believe it. It's brown and not fizzing. It's amazing what not adding butterscotch, pickle juice, or fresca will do. Give me the ring. I don't have it. Well, where is it?
Beautiful indeed. Not the decor. Her! No, no, no... Oh my goodness no. How are my spines?
I don't know what he's talking about. I didn't... I remember your prom date. She looked like Brian Dennehy, but with long, red hair. You know what we used to call this guy in high school? We used to call him the Herdsman.
It's just mostly the three "c"s. Uh, the three "c"s, sir? Uh, cocktails, condoms, and call girls. I can't believe life's kicked me in the nard sack. Life's not fair, princess.
I'm gonna call it a little early. What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town.
What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained.
No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right.
I found the swab yesterday. I know that you didn't send in calvin's dna to the lab. You're snooping through my desk? You left your drawer open. I went to close it.
I didn't come here to steal your thunder. Your thunder is your thunder, and my thunder is my thunder. I know. It's just that God gave you so much thunder. Yeah, maybe too much. I hate how those women look at me.
Your thunder is your thunder, and my thunder is my thunder. I know. It's just that God gave you so much thunder. Yeah, maybe too much. I hate how those women look at me. You think I don't know what they're thinking? "Here comes the hot one with the big boobies that is gonna steal my husband."
But Morgana's army are not dead, they are very much alive. Anyone who toys with the Cup pays a terrible price. The moment they entered their pact with Morgause, they became the living dead. You MUST come to the lake. And you will give me the sword?
- Right. He used to say, "I'll just tape an aspirin to my helmet," and go back on the field. - All the guys were like that. - Yeah. Did he complain at all about, uh, headaches, blurred vision, memory loss?

It's passed through the wheels of change. In and out of experience. Stories, adventure, grandads. Inevitably the ride stops. Lost but not entirely gone.
This comes naturally. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lake with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice it will be easy as pie! How clever!
Ben Hur's story is not possible without Jesus's message: "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." And that's actually an extremely sophisticated message that he's offering, it's a civilising message, STEVE SHILL DIRECTOR forgive people who have actually done terrible wrongs, because if you don't start it, who will. Generally it's the same story of a jew oppressed by the Romans, who was wronged by his best friend.
It's time to get some fresh air. Further south in Kappelrodeck. the cherry trees are in bloom. Spring lambs and other youngsters are at play in the fields. And the storks have made it back, and are looking for a home. Storks' nests are true works of art, consisting of up to 300 kg of wood.
Sailors hardly have time for the notorious nightlife at the Reeperbahn. MARCH In March, the sun finally shines stronger. Above Hohenzollern Castle in southern Germany. the sun hints at spring to come.
Magdeburg was demolished on January 16. 1945. On March 16 of that year. destruction came to Würzburg, and its baroque palace. And a year earlier 16,000 bombs rained down upon Münster. The bells of the city's cathedral melted in the heat.
Oh, you mean the stars. That's the thing I've charted stars and they're always constant. But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother. Only on my birthday.
You know, you really might want to consider... ls that my hairbrush? Oh, this is yours? Here, I'm done anyway. Just be sure you clean it before you give it back. Give it back?
My child waits to do your will. Leave us. Release the Kraken! The Kraken comes now! Our suffering ends when the beast is sated!
-Sorry. What are you doing with the flowers? They're all the ones that nobody wants. So you're giving them a second life? Yeah, most shops throw them away.
Booked back-to-back at the same restaurant. Thought we wouldn't notice. -What? -Please lead me to the alcohol. -Right here. Sit down. -We are gonna take good care of you. What happened to the piñata?
Yeah, I think I can learn a lot from her. No, no, you first, you first. - No, just real quick. I just... - Mmm-hmm? I had the most amazing day. I got to answer a letter that was written 50 years ago.
Of course we're not, darling. Hi. ls Claire with you? No? She's turned in early, actually. Okay. I was gonna ask if you wanted dinner, but... I just... I wanted to get started on my story.
The Elder Wand. The most powerful wand ever made. The Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here? To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister? I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter. And this is...? "Herein is set forth the last will and testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
As your new Minister for Magic I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today each employee will submit themselves for evaluation. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide. Be a bit gentler. They have flesh memories.
- Wait, wait! We need more time! - Why are you here? - Look, we think it has something to do with what happened to your son after he went to prison. - Isn't this what you want?
- What are you thinking? - He said something about a splatter and killing everyone or something like that. - Maybe you should move them out of the way of the splatter. I'd hate to see somebody die before you get a chance to kill 'em yourself. - Yeah, he was being a smart-ass.
The coils are firing at such a high frequency that the sparks literally create soundwaves as they fly through the air. Which is nerdy. You were listening. I played this song the other night. These coils are my life.
Hey, Becky. Becky? Hey, Becky? So how are you enjoying Physics 101? My brain just does not think physics.
Now, I know that the people are still angry. Yes, they are, and so am I. But I hope, I trust that President Lincoln appointed you because you hold the Constitution sacred. Whether you believe Mary Surratt is guilty or innocent, the Constitution was intended... And now you're gonna lecture me on the Constitution. ...to protect the rights of all citizens at all times in peace or war.
I thought Machete don't text. Machete improvise. Where're you going? Take out the trash. Machete, sent me a text.
Mademoiselle! That way. How are they all moving so fast? Well, they're not wearing four-inch hoochie heels, for starters. Let me tell you something about shoes, Meg.
Plus, you heard the man. We're not getting in there unless we've got some tail. Well, I got an idea. So what do these cousins of yours look like? What? You're picky all of a sudden?
We're not getting in there unless we've got some tail. Well, I got an idea. So what do these cousins of yours look like? What? You're picky all of a sudden? But yeah, are they hot?
Yeah. But look at that cat. So what do you think? I doubt the hope of all humanity lies in sketchy homegrown science. Look, what if it works?
So we had it and we went out to a club and it was incredible. It was really incredible. Something like a very concentrated version of the best feeling I'd ever had in my life. It was just, like, fantastic. I just felt, like, in love. But not with anything in particular, or anybody, just with everything. Just everything was perfect.
We hope you've enjoyed the show tonight. Have you enjoyed it? I was boss of Parlophone Records and I'd made it my business, over the previous years, to develop Parlophone as a comedy label. And, in fact, when Brian Epstein desperately took us on, or hoped we would take him on, he felt he'd hit rock bottom, cos he'd been everywhere else and now he was ending up on a comedy label. I first met The Beatles in 1962. I wasn't terribly impressed with the first stuff they did.
Though his time wearing the ring has been brief... Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be remembered as long as the Corps exists. His actions are a reminder of why the ring chose each of us. To overcome fear... and destroy evil wherever it may hide. As Lanterns, we must fight with all our will. Our wills haven't always been united.
That's really cool. Ha, ha. So, what happens now? I'm gonna go look for trouble. Of all the Lanterns who have ever worn the ring... there was one whose light shined brightest. At first, his humanity was thought to be a weakness.
OK. I also wanted a needle, thread and scissors. You're joking, right? Yeah. Our face identifies us.
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say. It's very important. As you've just seen, the operation was successful... but the tissues of the vagina are still very tender and could stick together. But don't worry, it's easy to prevent that. You...
Still and all, we're gonna have a look around the place, huh? Go crazy. You got the warrant. Alright, start with the couch. Sir? Hey, you know, we got a history on the piece.
'It's taken me a while to put this together. 'I'm not so great at writing letters, but I wanted to get in touch. 'Life's been mad for me in the past 12 months. 'Been awful sick for a number of reasons. 'I don't know if it got in the papers to you, 'but Samuel got attacked by that dog.
You guys are stuck looking like that. Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you. So you think. Allinol by itself is good for you.
Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you. So you think. Allinol by itself is good for you. But after microscopic examination I have found that it has one small weakness.
- I'm working on it. They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back. - Another crash! - It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley. Embrace your inner lemon.
You? You're the helper! Helper. That's great. Okay, so to the extent I understand what you're talking about here. ..
It reminds me that I'm pan of an infinite and eternal whole. A SHORT AUTUMN The dog committed suicide. Apparently it was a 40-year-old prostitute's only companion and was locked out on the balcony so it wouldn't bother her customers. The dog went mad when they touched her.
Kevin? Kevin, you hear that? Dad goes pee pee. You can do that too. So you want a connector right there. You see?

Not him. Give him to the jailer. He can work in the salt mines. His pain has just begun. Hyperion's legions show no mercy. They have destroyed every holy shrine in their quest for the Epirus Bow.
How are you? How's Gale? Uh, I'm all right. But Gale, it's been hard on her. Small town... small-town husband. Not much to write about. You two okay?
How's Gale? Uh, I'm all right. But Gale, it's been hard on her. Small town... small-town husband. Not much to write about. You two okay? Well, I read somewhere once, "Just when you think things can't get any worse, "sometimes they don't.
Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter. It's designed to amplify brainwaves so it could enhance your telepathic powers, help us find other mutants for our division. What if they don't want to be found by you? Erik. You decided to stay.
I can't. I promised Yana that I won't do anything illegal. If there's no evidence, you aren't guilty, right? Hey... where were you? I had the interview, remember?
Sir? That sounds too 'honest'. Call me Don. I have a job for you. The security system at the DZB's currency centre... is controlled by a master computer.
No way, sir. Please don't even think of that. - Why not? Because there are two things that will happen.. ...If you try to blow it open. First... a chemical gas will release into the chamber.
Oh, hey, look sharp, man. You see that tall building up ahead? That's the Citadel. Your mom's up at the top. You get up there and get your mom.
Hey, down here. Stupid monkey ... So you? Come on, make it! Court order hasn't been filed, so it's not in the system.
Believe me, we talked about it. We have five years of conclusive data. Parade all the data you want, you will never convince anyone to invest another dime. This drug has the potential to save lives! Bankrupt this company, more like.
Oh, wait, there's probably a lot of Boyd Boltons. OK, so just so you know, I'm the one that lives in Iowa City. I don't think there's any other Boyd Boltons that live in Iowa City, but if there is, I'm the one who runs Bolton Supercenter. Yeah, anyway... I just wanted to take this moment to thank you for sending Laura Pickler to fuck me.
Speaking of which, shouldn't you be in school as well? I got expelled. Expelled? For what? Heresy.
Gunter! Gentle Jesus, please make it stop. Gunter! For the love of God, Alice! Will you just shut it up? !
My shoes are broken. I don't know. How are the children? It's only a rat. Come on, sit down.
We went in and did a demo pretty quickly after that with Matt Cameron. And I was like, "What are you guys gonna do with it?" And they were like, "We're just trying to get a singer." I was working a security job in San Diego. I was just, like, writing music in my living room for the longest time, you know.
I'll find you by the pm. Fuck. (SERBO-CROATIAN) I found a car. Someone left it on the street. I could get 300 - 400 Euros for it, I'm sure.
I like your new look. Well, thank you. You look... marvellous. You look very elegant, yourself. Is it morning already? Excuse me?
Ross "The Boss" Rhea was sent down to Boston's affiliate in the EMHL, the St. John's Shamrocks... the same team where he started his storied career, a career a lot of people believe is coming to a close. This is where I started out. This is where I'm from. I suppose this is as good a place as any for me to end up. Rhea is a repeat offender, having sat out 12 games after his infamous head-shot on Xavier LaFlamme three years ago.
I doubt it. It's been there for so long. But between you, me and the Kool, I think the girls lifted it. You sure? Look, the other night, I'm wiping down the reference room, I hear the girls sneaking in, giggling.
"The Inaugural Class Music Box." Yeah, the first graduating class gifted it to the school. You open it, it'd play the school song. Not really worth much, but it's sentimental. Well, I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal it.
They didn't steal the bird! Uh, they found it. Yeah, it was wandering around the quad and they brought it to me. Thank you, girls. There go one of my flock in need of some counseling.
This cannot anger him: my invocation Is fair and honest. Come. He hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night: Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
Well, actually, I was looking for the... Oh, they're in the back of the library. So much wine. - So much to look at. - Yeah. You've only seen the inside. I should show you the maze.
And when I done that, he stuck a knife in me. I ain't even see it coming. Blood's just flying everywhere. This wasn't no jailhouse shiv neither. This was one of them Italian switchblades... One of them black-and-silver jobs.
Well, it doesn't sound like you doing anybody. I do fine, thank you very much. You see all these women that you've been with, they wanna choke them. Like, during sex? Whenever ..
We found defeat again in Chancellorsville. It's quite an unsettling feeling, to face one's nerves this often. To accept death before each call to advance is frightening. Yet it is the only way to move boots made solid by the sound of shelling. I can't explain all this, what uncertainty does to a man's soul,
Valery! Papa is dead. I don't believe you. Where are they going? The storks return here each year.
Where are they going? The storks return here each year. How do they find their way? I don't know. They speak a language that man has forgotten.
Don't try this at home. Not allowed. - Do you wish to die? "Wicked Speed. The destination ahead, the wind at my back."
"Wicked Speed." There's a bomb on the train. Time-bomb. Get inside. - Duck.
He's right here. He's back. "Wicked Speed. The destination ahead, the wind at my back." "Wicked Speed. The destination ahead, the wind at my back."
Your boss, Armansky yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you so I suppose I should be flattered. You gonna sit down? He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is sensitive. That's the word he used, "sensitive." l'm gonna use "illegal" because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer. No, I'm not gonna do anything about that. I could, but I won't.
I wanted to go. The food in Italy is good. Yes. And what about the women? Not as good as the food.
Thank you. Man! This puppy here reminds me of my first Dodge. Uh-huh? Remember that? Remember when cars were meant just to be fun things to have, right?
They know what they're doing. They do statistics to make sure that a certain amount of people miss it. I mean, I don't know how much you've dealt with athletes. I can see things differently. Everything just comes to a blur.
Yeah. See, I understand that. I relate. But, listen. That motor... That motor in that car...
Donnie. Is everybody okay? Yeah, everybody's great, man. I'm just calling to say hey, that's all. Hey. How are the girls?
Three DEA agents along with them. Of course, this is business and sometimes things go astray. All I care about is the car. Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go. This roofing plastic says you're full of shit.
- At least. Lord, I love the smell of roasting coffee. Would you like to go in? All right. Look at the chocolates.
Lord, I love the smell of roasting coffee. Would you like to go in? All right. Look at the chocolates. Aren't they gorgeous?
Not for me, not for Joseph. Were you afraid I wasn't coming? Not very. Did you see that one? Did you see that dress?
Oh. That sucks more. That's the plumber. I called him to look at this piece-of-crap boiler. Why?
Mike! Did you call Fenn about the tree? No. I will today. Please do.
No, I didn't know that. I was an engineer by trade. It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia. It spanned 912 feet above the Ohio River. 12,100 people use this thing a day.
No, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what have I done? I never wanna see that man again. Mom, I'm coming home.
You signed my name? Why would you sign my name? Because this is your fault. You got me all pumped up by supporting me. That's what husbands do.
It can wait. And can you come with me? Um, I know why you're angry. No, I'm not angry. Okay, maybe a little.
Was it? Yeah. I tried to go home and see him that night, but I didn't go in. There was a car in the driveway, and just... A car?
- Great, same page. - Did I just step on a lizard? - Yep. Is he OK? Because my foot feels like it's flat on the ground.
I kicked Trav out. I know he has no place else to go, so I know he went back to college! - Oh, man. - What? Nobody told me I wasn't supposed to give him my boat.
All right. You think the one we already made is ready yet? I hope so. All right, let's check it out. Here we go. Ta-da.
Besides Tina's abrupt personal transformation, the compositions came back from the doctor, showing what my nose would look like slightly altered, and I have to say, I'm really happy with the results. They're less Hebraic, and more Fabrayic. That doesn't really look like you. Every year, girls show up to my temple after their 16th birthday, looking suddenly slightly different. And you know what?
- The POW? - Pulse Operated Weapon. Creates an aimed impacted equivalent to 10 grenades. Has it been used yet in combat? The first set doesn't come off-line until next year.
He's a morpher. You know what that means? He changes shapes. Anyone he touches, he can imitate. Sorry, you wanted him to answer. His DNA has a replicating element.
Ah! All right, listen up! Listen up! Listen up! You feel that?
All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy and I left. Okay. Don't really know where we go from here.
Done. No, of course not. I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.
Reality TV. A woman with "hundruplets," a live execution, the real transvestite hoarders of Orange County Penitentiary. Ugh, that show is upsetting. Why does the warden let Lady Extravaganza have so many spoons? Programs like that are the lifeblood of this industry.
We need you to read a suspect's mind. No, I don't think so. Please, Simon, come back to Boston with me. A city the size of Boston? You got to be joking.
We, uh... We... We met before? I treated you for your arachnid infestation. I'm not surprised you don't remember me. You were in a lot of pain. So how are the spiders?
Look, I know when I'm away, we can be a bit off. Just want to make sure it's not something more. No. It's just everything's a little overwhelming since Broyles went missing. Do you have any leads? No.
That's comforting. Looks like we got a live one. Gotcha. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Secretary. I see the piece that Agent Dunham obtained was finally sent over.
Passenger 9 is clear. We've also fully accounted for zeppelin crew - and ground personnel. - The food for the airship... It's supplied by an LFC Food Services.
I'm just leaving the house. What's up? Don't come down here. We got a hit. Six months ago, Silva purchased a plasmid array.
I knew the pieces were buried millions of years ago, but how did they get there, so deep in the past? But now I understand. I sent them there. The wormhole in Central Park-- I sent them back through time.
It can't be worse than this. What would I need to do? Walter? What's happening to him? His heart rate's going up-- 156 and climbing!
I understand if you want to end it. It's very unbecoming of a princess. I want you, Blair. But the only way it will work is if you show me all of the parts of yourself, even the ones you're ashamed of.
Oh, thank you, honey. Ok, pop quiz. The dagger and white ash are in the Salvatores possession, correct? The dagger was used to kill Elijah. You'll find him in the basement of the Salvatore house.
Wondering exactly what "I don't need you anymore" means. I'm trying to figure out what not needing someone means, too. I don't know exactly, but I don't think it has to do with not loving them. Well, I'm relieved to hear that, but things go deeper than that in our world. There's a fundamental way a family works.
Come on. Where should I put my plant? - It's a little dark. - It's okay. I think it fits well here.
And I wanna say something! I thought the whole point of all this coming-into-the-light stuff was that we were ultimately supposed to be accepted, but nobody is exactly embracing us with open arms. So what happens now? What's the plan now? The caucus is over?
Sure. The bear is a solitary animal. They like their space. They live in a magic circle. They mind if you're like a mile away, but if you get inside their circle, they will maul you.
Hoods are good for a roll in the hay, but you don't marry them. I do agree with you, but Jason has become a bootstrapper. Hoods, bootstrappers, same thing. I know, right? Then the ushers take the mother of the bride and mother of the groom to their seats on opposite sides of the aisle.
I hope our honeymoon's better than this. I promise you. Dear Sabrina, I'm sorry. I feel sick about how I behaved this weekend. I was afraid of being alone.
I wish I could just come home. So come home. We want you there. Stan doesn't. As far as he's concerned, the only reason I was living there was the life debt he owed me.
Yeah, we're dancing. We're not dancing. Hey, champ. I, uh, wanted to talk to you. You know, about what you just saw.
Our marriage isn't strong enough to survive a remodel. So let's not remodel. Exactly. We're great together, as long as we don't put any stress on our marriage. It's like a rickety bridge that's fine, as long as you don't drive anything heavy over it.
Ryoko's the V.P. of sales for Pacific Rim Industries. My firm handles their security here in town. So when her cousin went missing, she figured I could help. My family back in Japan lives in a small village near Kyoto. They said some girls there were approached by men from the city -- criminals -- that convinced young women to go with them.
It's important to keep your guard up at the end of an operation. Once you've found your target, won their trust, and made a deal, it's natural to want to relax a bit. Hop in. Keep your hands to yourself. But the fact is, that's exactly the time to be most careful.
Lambert dumped you, and you blew him up. I wasn't sleeping with Dr. Lambert. And I certainly didn't kill him. So he wasn't the man that you were having sex with at the party? You lied to us about being in your office at the time of the explosion.
He wasn't really around that much. But Sydney-- she used to spent a lot of time with his daughter Camryn. I mean, even when her mother was alive, she was basically alone, or with babysitters. Lawyers-- you know, they work day and night. Camryn-- she raised herself. But when Ron started dating Sydney, all that changed.
I mean, we didn't tell the girls that, of course. Said we were producing a new hip-hop musical. So Ron watches the tapes, and he picks the girls that he likes? Yeah, and then I set up the dates. Tell the girls Ron's the executive producer on the project, make him sound important.
Then he went to Dr. Kole's for plastic surgery. Then he and Tina started making movies of Vivian in the old house to send to Daddy. Nate was careful to stay in the background. He didn't want us to know that he'd changed his face. Then he sent the two brides to kill the doctor and the nurse.
Juice? You want me to juice? I want you to win. That was amazing. The penis is an extraordinary instrument, Jane.
I just bought 5 million dollars for 3,188,572 euros. Now the dollar's worth 0.637 euros. When the American President finishes his speech, I think the dollar will explode. Follow me?

3 times a day. So you founded the company with these two, and then you nobbled the one on the left, using some legal loophole, just before you were about to make billions. And you enjoyed every minute of it. You read micro-expressions. I saw an article on that once. Kyle wouldn't risk his lawsuit on some half-baked mindreader, so you must be working for Claire.
No! What the hell did you do? It's not me, it's Zach. He planted a logic bomb. You set off a virus in my network?
- Can I? - Yes, of course. This is me. That's you, and these are our kids. Oh, our daughter's so pretty.
I knew that Cotes-Preedy wouldn't be able to keep this quiet, so that's why when you asked me to find a house for Miss Monroe, I took the precaution of finding two. So the other one, Parkside, is much better. And the owner is very discreet. So we've got two expensive houses now where we only needed one. I thought that someone else on the production might want it. Oh, did you?

Five, six, seven, eight. It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight. One, two, three... One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You guys got to trust that the guys have your back.
-I'll be dying either way. I've got to get out of here, Katie. I've never been anywhere. And I want to see the world, overdose on daiquiris and be thrown into a volcano. But you need money for that.
It's a small thing, not bigger than this. Do you know where it is? Well, if you give it to me Don Luis will be very happy and very grateful. So why don't you just give me that little thing which belongs to him? Would you do that?
No matter what these children do they cannot be met with such verbal aggression. Do you hear that? Librarians kill for that kind of quiet. I know. Me too.
They have renounced life. There is nothing worse for a man than to give up their lives. Nothing! You know what Hafez says: "I do not bow The wheel of fate.
I never see them again. What a fool. Come on, come with me. This violin belonged to my teacher. He gave it to me.
This violin belonged to my teacher. He gave it to me. Now it's yours. You know, my child, now is the one you lost, be in every note that you play. She's your breath and your breath.

That animal is going to change your life. Let that pig loose in your sty and your boars will perform like never before. Your sows will get pregnant... just like that. It is very easy to use. You just sit in your chair, press the button on the remote control and... off it goes.
Consider this a warning. Be smart. Think of that pregnant wife of yours, Jimmy. This is reconnaissance mission. Until I'm ready, my anonymity is an obvious priority.
Did you guys find anything? We've looked through every box and found a big, fat nothing. "Don't say I never gave you anything. Turn on your computer. A."

I need to wrap it up. You said you found something? Uh, I haven't begun the autopsy yet, but, uh, I thought you should know the lieutenant was eight to ten weeks pregnant. Salads are not stakeout food. Well, they should be.

After the 30th of October, when two boys were accidentally killed, the violence spread to 374 communes in the suburbs and provinces. The damage is enormous 10,000 cars and 300 public buildings set on fire. Violent acts perpetrated against citizens police officers, doctors, firemen. 130 in all, Mr. President. Some were shot with real bullets. The reality of the suburbs is very simple. We've allowed gang law to take the place of the laws of the State.
As of this morning I'm Minister of the Interior. What does that imply? The police need the means to work. I ask you to apply my policies and my policies are simple. Results. Figures.
I feel better about losing my finger now. One shot. I heard you. What were you shootin' at? You'll see. What is that new tune?

But also that he's guilty of the theft. Sadly, yes. Ambassador Kyi, if we prove that someone else stole the ruby, I assume you would release Christopher? Well, of course I would bring that evidence to our courts. I believe the Myanmar people have a saying...
Well, you know where he is. All right, have your diplomatic friends on speed dial. If this goes wrong, Neal and I are gonna start an international incident. Mr. Caffrey, you're still here. Yeah, I wanted to make sure the ruby makes it home safely.
Humans are frequent casualties of the harsh and cursed swampland, and this Swamp Gut is not above scavenging from a corpse. Good friends are hard to find these days for Swamp Gut. Signs of the enemy are detected and examined closely. Fishing in these nefarious waters is nearly suicidal. Swamp Gut has developed a savage combat technique for such reckless adventurers.
We had a system. Always left a hat on the bedroom door when one of us got lucky. Was usually me. Oh, Dad, please shut up! I don't know what it is, but you'll find girls just seem to let themselves go a bit more abroad.

It's so big, so complicated. - And so sad. - But why? Why pull the living soul from a Tardis and pop it in a tiny human head? What does it want you for?

Perfect time to meet Hallie About time somebody loved Bob for Bob again There's been nobody a long time who's loved Bob for Bob Nobody loves me like Hallie Nobody I've never loved a woman like Hallie in my life Never in my life and never will again - He's got to take winter boots I don't care what he says Are they that bad?
Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint you, but thanks. It's exactly what I needed to hear. This is a video phone. Whatever a video phone is. You should kill us all on sight.
It's exactly what I needed to hear. This is a video phone. Whatever a video phone is. You should kill us all on sight. This suit, it seems to be repairing itself.
And I just bought some popcorn... and I saw her come out of the theater with this, you know, butch lady... and all of the sudden, she just kissed her on the mouth. - That changes everything. - Why? Because, Tyler, women are more community-oriented. They're caring. They're moms...
What am I supposed to stay here for? Doing what, dammit? Hey, calm down, lower your voice. This isn't easy on any of us. No point getting worked up.
You pay him what I tell you to pay him, but make sure you pay him on time. I'm paying him on time, he said to me that you're not got giving him enough. Please tell me you ain't shagging her. I got a missus, ain't I? I know, I know.
- Take care, yeah. - See ya later. Deano, Deano! You all right, mate? - Hiya.
And, uh... Wow, really? I mean, 29? I need to teach you certain rules. Like what?
Naked Lancelot... teacher, pants on. Trying to fix your guitar? Nope. You're not here to drop my class after one lecture, are you?
I kind of get the whole passing-judgment thing. But I'm not 19, and I know that I should've been honest with you. So be honest now. When I was a teenager, I was a mess. I was popular, but I had no idea who I was or what I wanted.
But you know what, cheers. - Cheers, boys. - Cheers. - Alright, (in Punjabi) - So, we drunk enough to surprise these girls yet?
I am Count of Pesaro, but somewhat by default. I was born a bastard. My father died without a legitimate heir. I inherited a title and virtually nothing else. My mother was niece to King Ferrante and my father was a Sforza. I am the illegitimate offspring of two families who hate each other.
- All right. - Sounds good to me. - This place is incredible. - Mm-hmm. I know you said at some point it was renovated, but... You don't understand how beautiful this place was... You don't understand, I mean...
We've got a great business. Real estate's gonna come back. I am not fucking giving this company away! While the real estate market has put Lehman Brothers shares under pressure, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are suddenly plummeting this morning after reports the companies may need to raise $75 billion just to remain solvent. Because they guarantee such an enormous percentage of the nation's mortgages, there is renewed speculation that the government may have to step in and take them over... a possibility Barack Obama has now raised on the campaign trail.
What are some examples of the most egregious offenders of commercials or brands or products that mislead you? I have a lot in my memory, but I lather them with amnesia because they're so disgusting. Remember how we talked about eating better? Well, it starts today. What's deceptive about advertising is the answer that it gives to how we can be happy.
- Japan? - Yes. - Why Japan? - She's Japanese. She's called Yoko.
Ready? -Yeah, yeah. I had a tripod brought in, so I can get a guaranteed hit. Wait. Here we go.
The champ! Whenever the bit involves Pontius' penis in a costume, you don't wanna be in the peanut gallery. Hey, Chris, we don't need to see your outfit from this side. You don't need to. It's a bonus. What most people don't know is, we did a lot of penis-related stunts 'cause there's so many funny ideas to do with the penis that have been yet unexplored.
I didn't tell you because I knew it would disappoint you. But then I realized it didn't matter because you have been disappointing me for years! You didn't show up today, and it hurt. You need to know that. Alice...
Like Donkey Kong. Simone, as an entrepreneur, it is in your interest to keep a clean record, correct? I could lose my business license. Because Rock Pole's categorized as "sexually-oriented," I have to pass routine background checks.

Well, in order to refine his life You have to live it. I'm sorry. It is easier to get into the story another catch Live as his own. I only chose women who wanted to die. And if you think about it, I give them a voice. Something they never had in life.
Charlie, blag a copy of the coroner's report. - Will do. - And then comes the memorial. Same place as Tommy drowned. Joe. Flowers on the water. They're not wildflowers.
Sit down! Keding you're not far from death. Let's wait on Wuchang. After the rabbit is killed the hunting dog will be cooked. Enemy positions have advanced.
Polo-My ... Come, I will do the kiss good luck. -Mom, stop. -A real student. I've noticed a sentence I've heard.
I have emptied. -I understand you. Perhaps you could ask itle ‡ your son no longer close. Have you tried to understand his problem? Envisages a dialogue?
They think I'm going to let my kid is cuiter ‡ 9am in the morning instead of going organic? No, but! I will not stick a slap, but a headbutt. You make me run away, I open the door more. We will not let piss by snotty not finished.
Are you okay? We found Wolfe. Yeah. Now let's find Nichols. You kill my security guard and then you accuse me of this? Listen, I didn't know any of these girls were hooking. It's nothing to do with me.
I'm sure you're not wasting your time, Alan. I'd be happy to look at it for you. Thanks. You should really ask the Governor if you want to take that home with you,  <hon>Mrs Travers<hoff>. I'll make sure I call his office.
His spirit returns. I am not a babe new dropped from fucking womb. See meat and wine set out. Yes, Domina. I always follow the wine.
let's be honest, ladies... it's never me. Why do I keep thinking I can be near you? - I don't know. - So you think you're doing these women a favor? Oh, I am doing them a favor.
Why do I keep thinking I can be near you? - I don't know. - So you think you're doing these women a favor? Oh, I am doing them a favor. You know, they get to break up with me.
Who's getting married? Just another debutante. Night, George. How was I? Bit slow on that last cue. Nice watch.
You work twice as hard as any man and none is half as good as you. I enjoy the company of men. Is it true you covered McCarthy's Lincoln Day speech? With a tape recorder that didn't work. Well, I don't believe you're prepared to give up this job for Mr Lyon.
Yet, they are rewarded and considered to be respectable. The tobacco company executive that shows a higher profit will get a much bigger reward. He doesn't face any negative consequences legally or otherwise. In fact he is a respected member of the board of several other corporations. But, tobacco smoke related diseases kill 5 ½ million people around the world every year.
He says: "Doctor, my brother thinks he's a chicken." And the doctor says, "Take a pill and that should cure the problem." And he says, "No doctor. You don't understand We need the eggs." Okay?
So this is huge if we look at the impact of construction and knowing about 40% of all materials in the world are used in construction. So, a big waste of energy and resources and big damage to the environment as well. Making homes using hammers and nails and wood with the state of our technology today, is really absurd and will go the way of our labor class in regards to manufacturing in the United States. Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT that states that our middle class is obsolete and being replaced by automation. Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive efficient and sustainable than human labor in virtually every sector of the economy today.
Surely the great creator had to have left some blueprints somewhere... Nope...nothing I can find. Okay then - so what's left? It appears something called "Science". Science is unique in that its methods demand not only that ideas proposed be tested and replicated... but everything science comes up with is also inherently falsifiable.
From the simple printing of basic household goods in your home to the printing of an entire automobile body in one swoop advanced, automated 3d printing now has the potential to transform virtually every field of production. Including home construction. Contour Crafting is actually a fabrication technology- the so-called 3-D printing- when you directly build 3-D objects from a computer model. Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible to build a 2000 square-foot home entirely by the machine, in one day. The reason that people are interested in automating construction is that it really brings a lot of benefits.

Enterprising... And great to see some multicultural interest! [Victims of Culture] As stated before, a Resource-Based Economy applies the Scientific Method to social concern and this isn't limited to simply technical efficiency. It also has the consideration of human and social well-being directly and what comprises it.
In the society, again, which is based on the power of certain people to control and profit from the lives and work of millions of others the dominant intellectual culture will reflect the needs of the dominant group. So, if you look across the board, the ideas that pervade psychology and sociology and history and political economy and political science fundamentally reflect certain elite interests. And the academics who question that too much tend to get shunted to the side or to be seen as sort of "radicals". The dominant values of a culture tend to support and perpetuate what is rewarded by that culture. And in a society where success and status is measured by material wealth
Pesticides are made from oil. You drive oil-powered machines to plant - plow - irrigate – harvest transport - package. You wrap the food in plastic – that's oil. All plastic is oil. There are 7 gallons of oil in every tire.
Guys, we need a mission. Sorry to disturb you, general. No, ahem, not at all. We were just wondering if there was anything that you or our country needed from us. Preferably far outside of America.
Just some wandering pack, only fewer. Okay. Come on, people. We still got a lot to do. Let's stay on it. Let's go, come on. Tracks are gone.
So what about this book, then? What about it? Come on, love. How much are you going to pay? It's not looking too good, is it? Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Gather round. You're gonna want to take a moment to get settled in, put 66 years of prison behind you. But we don't have a moment to waste. Some of you will be taken to the portal array's location to finish the infrastructure. Depending on your specialties, the rest will do final design work, helping us obtain the rest of what we need.
- And that's you. On the contrary, I would maintain and my lawyers would maintain my sentence was carried out successfully. Nothing went wrong- absolutely nothing. The fact that life and the laws of life on this Earth have changed is hardly my fault. Society is full of out-there laws, Mr. Danes.
He's a great guy, but he's dangerous to have on the tribe. It looks like greased lightning. - Just need a little... - I'm working on. Dreads.
The guys are in awe of Rob, and, you know, he's going after all the young girls because they're easy pickings. So whatever I do, I think he's probably who I'm going to try and focus on really quickly. If there's an idol out there, if I at all can do anything to find one, then I will do it. If anyone can do it on this tribe, it's me. My immunity idol antenna have been on alert since I hit the beach.
I cleaned up. Wanted it to be nice for her. For a second I thought I was in the wrong place. A flower? It's a Cherokee rose.
- The hell we can't. It's hard enough accepting what's happened without digging up the past. I'll tell you what it is. It's nostalgia. It's like a drug.
Sprayed the room. Where are the guns kept? The key's always kept here. Which, of course, Favelloni knew. But, um... the fingerprints on it weren't his, were they?
Yeah, this girl has love potential. - Ooh, love. - Shut it. We are gonna do this for hours until we get it right. Even if it takes hours. Now, sing like your life depends on it.
Don't you worry, Mum. I'm gonna be the best carer that Cilla could ever wish for. You get some rest. Backed up by researchers into child development. The closer the mother - or father - they are to baby, it creates a stronger and deeper bond, yeah?
Where is she? Shit! I've left her on the bus! They should call this Britain's Got No Fecking Talent! Rain makes the flowers grow, you know.
Poco, me ex. He was a scouser. D'you know him? As fucked up as that question is, I do, as it happens. He used to sell weed from the back of a caravan, and every time he sold an ounce, he'd go... (Both) "Buzzin' laughin', toffee apple kidda!" (All) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
And we're like "We know him better than you, Libby. "He'll rob, cheat, run away." In fairness, Carl, he has got previous. Don't make it right, does it? It's her I feel sorry for.
We made dinner... for you. What is it? Um, grilled chicken breast and some brown rice and broccoli... Mmm. And... is that coffee?
- Rex, do you hear me? - Oh yeah? Wow, that's-- that's wonderful. Yeah, it's great to be back. If it looked like we were traitors being paid off, all they'd have to do is lay a false trail to Beijing or wherever while our bodies are in some shallow grave in Virginia somewhere.
A long way away. And did it help? Hey, lovebirds. Let me ask you a question. What the hell is this thing?
Please, somebody help me! ♪ Criminal Minds 6x15 ♪ Today I Do Original Air Date on February 16, 2011 "It's hard to find an enemy who has outposts in your head." Sally Kempton. All right, baby girl. Keep looking. Garcia still hasn't found any overlap between Molly Grandin and Gail Langston's lives.
Man up, Carl. Come on! I'm not a man. I'm just a kid. I don't want to go with you.
He'll have been out spilling his seed, just like his father. My Brendan was the same. Spilling it everywhere, just like a hose. Ruined the Axminster. Had his prostrate whizzed out, that put a stop to it.
That' obviously a big factor, cos if she was sober it' much different than if she was fucked up. No, but, like, how do I go about just... Delivering the cock to her? Yeah, delivering the cock to her. I think there' a missing link somewhere in there.
That's clever. What can I say? I'm a professional. Seem a little cocky for a kid who's looking at jail time. Whoa, wait a minute.
The key is discipline. I am all about discipline. That's why I got into karate. It provides me both mental and physical balance. Uh-huh. Plus, an excuse to walk around in drawstring pajamas.
They call her Beauty Not Knowing. To reach the king's court, you must pass through three passages, guarded by a giant bee, a giant mongoose and a giant iguana. They're angry because they're always so hungry, and temper makes them huge. They'll definitely want to eat you, but I like the look of you, so I'll help you. Here you see the dreaded "flores datura".
My new raw vitalizer virtually eliminates wrinkles. - Really? Look, I am fine. - Jan you and I both know nobody says no to me. Try some.
- No. Merry Christmas. You don't have a tumor, you have a tree growing in your lung. - My husband has a what? - A tree.
You can't tell me they don't. Dropping out of the chief's trial was a real bonehead move, Avery. - Such a bonehead move, that I started thinking, maybe the chief's trial is flawed. So I looked into it myself. The methodology is flawless.
- I made that choice long ago. - We have another class, but I will see you tonight. - You have to tell him. - It is disturbing, to say the least. The creature is frozen, has been frozen for millennia,
But here you are, so I have to assume there are some issues. We don't have issues. Well, no big ones. She won't wear her engagement ring. It was broken, and I had it fixed and polished.
From the Duke of Milan. Well, Cardinal. I will consider it. - Fresh bread here! Florence, the time will come, when all your finery, goods, and chattels will profit you nothing. You have lived in usury, Florence, like pigs in heat.
She can sleep well at night. Show me your hands, Paolo. Bring them here. I would touch them. Soft.
Apparently, he dropped dead right in front of him at the duke's table. Poison. So it is rumoured. Gluttony, it is said. But the result's the same.
! What is this, fucking Prohibition? Is Eliot Ness back in town? You know, the Untouchables... Sorry, no offence, mate. Girls are reclaiming the night.
You asshole! Juan, these friends of yours give me the creeps! - So, what did he say? - He had a plan. Fuck! Don't look at me like that!
It's important you don't pass out. You hear me? I want to go home! Let us out of here! Here you have the power of the psyche.
And he provided me with a position. It was a good exchange and it worked well. How can Matthew have chosen that little blonde piece? You speak so eloquently of the human heart, Mama. You must be aware of its...vagaries.
It's because we ordered him to go. We don't know that. This is a tragedy, I don't deny it. But I cannot see what other course was open to me. We have no room for men to convalesce and Farley is the nearest house I can send them to.
At first I wasn't too sure about the kid thing, but now I'm crazy for them both. Well, I'm really happy for you. Hey, don't worry about this whole mother thing. When the time comes, you'll be great at it. And how do you know?
To be exact. That wasn't in the report, Captain. Excuse me. Captain! Was the body clean or dirty? - What?
There are changes coming, michael. Take my word for it. And that box Is what's gonna make those changes possible. - Make what possible? - Freedom.
What do you think about the box? This is a biometric sensor? First level of security requires a blood sample. We have that. The rest is up to you.
What? Is it completely healed? No, not at all. I don't get it. The doctor said she'd be fine.

Or whatever it was, you know? I decided that I was gonna take my favorite songs that I'd written over the last four or five years that no one had heard... and I was going to record them at a 24-track studio down the street from my house. And it was really exciting, because I was doing it totally by myself. I didn't know why I was doing it. I just wanted to do something, you know?
And sometimes it was great, and sometimes it wasn't. What sucked about all that was, you know... I don't think the drum performances were the best. They didn't... They weren't horrible.
Just drop it, we follow another track. Thanks. It's a fake. 30th of December 30 years ago, Françoise Berthier, architecture student, went underground to join an armed group during Italy's dark years with Aldo Moro, the Red Brigades and so on... At the beginning of the 80's, Tecla Tittoni who was wanted by the police, vanished.
You said that the concoction smelled bad... So I cut this yam into 8-10 centimeters and mixed it with some fresh fruits, yogurt and milk. Please, drink it when it's cool. Yam is very good for your health. It helps a lot to refresh your body.
Most of all, it is very worthy... What's that? That is a bicycle. Don't you know a bicycle? I know it.
Dad... Ms. Monica... Monica, are you alright? What is the exact location? The signal is getting weak.
Could be where she made contact with the unsub. Garcia, get us a list of jobs that Amber worked the last few months, and look for personal checks she might have deposited as under-the-table payments. Copy that. The unsub stalks his victims. He knows their routine.
How's it going? We've delivered the profile and the locals are canvassing the area. Any leads? Did you call for a field update? No.
Finally, we were ready, and after spending Every dime we had on I.V.F., Two miscarriages in the second trimester. But when this baby finally made it to 24 weeks, We--we thought... We--we thought it would be okay. But it's not, Because our baby will be lucky to get a full day of life. So either god really hates us, Or she made it this far for a reason.
Call Blake. We're gonna need blueprints of their yoga studio. It's all about connections. Bingo. The pipes from the yoga studio and the vegan restaurant are connected.
I have homework and after that... I must attend a very important tennis tournament. See you tomorrow at school. We're going to make a test. We're going to use this object.
- Parents don't agree'? - Most not. But it's illegal to force a minor to have an abortion. They're legally responsible. Five girls pregnant at high school... something has to be done.
He's not. I called. You want to bet your moms took him with her on her boat? Regi didn't take him, Holder. You know, moms be doing crazy-ass things, you know?
We have to get you tired before you can rest. - Tired? - Come on. Surprise! You didn't think I was just gonna take you to some lame spa?
Oh, that's not funny. I'm not kidding, Amy. I don't want her here. You know, some of us need people, more than flowers to communicate with. My flowers don't judge me.
Welcome to the perv parade that leads to nowhere. Any progress on the doll? - Yeah, the name is perfect penny. Manufacturer stopped making it in 1989. It hasn't been on store shelves in over 20 years.
They want to grow. But as they become more established they become more austere. What about ice dancing? That is the exception. But the rule still holds.
But for everyone else this is the truth. As time passes, they begin to understand the value of modesty, of group strength, of groups making collective decisions, of keeping your mouth shut and checking up the ranks. - You understand though? Good. I don't know where my ball has landed.
Um-- - Do I have to find another lab partner? Nah, I managed to smooth things over with Hannah, convinced her it was an aspie thing. Look, mammaries are just another body part, and I don't have any, so--- So of course I'm curious! Yeah, okay, but you can't stare! I mean, girls think it's weird.
Whew! Could you tell me I'm not going to jail. I mean, it-it was self-defence! Drew, let the lawyer talk. I've read your statement.
And if he's released? The unsub will do whatever he needs to do to survive. And we lose Marcy. Seaver, go to the Owens' cottage, see if you can take a look at Marcy through the unsub's eyes. Ok. Angela's autopsy is almost finished.
I might have brought a baseball bat, he might have fell on it a couple times, but that is all you're gonna put on me. So Leung finds out about the drugs and threatens to go to the police? No. He just didn't want his kid involved. All right. We're gonna run this gun.
We got another fish. Look at this fish. This is a special fish, huh? - It's a bullet hole. - Yeah. See, either they got an interesting new way to catch fish, or we just found our ballistics evidence.
It's cool. The coil's hot. Would you--would you like to-- Yes, thank you. Well, not bad if you were trying to miss.
Call my mom, okay? I want to go home now. Same symptoms as the pilot? Not as far regressed yet. Two victims unrelated.
Hello to you too. So we're doing a little show here, and since you're currently not making any sense, I'm just gonna ignore you. My partner Pete is regressing like the others. Now, what are you using to make this happen? Look, those people aren't sick.
I'm defending a man accused of murder. In this country, there's a difference. And what about Amy's family? I suppose you think the first amendment only protects your client? Who protects his victims?
We need to talk. Can it wait until tomorrow? I don't think what happened to the President was an accident. Not an accident? Well, he had a stroke. Never felt right to me.
Walton said the guy beat up a tattooist for spelling "Aryan" wrong. There we go. Walton asked me questions about crime in my hometown, Fontana. Very good. We're getting somewhere here.
- Lisa, Bruno, two old friends. Winki, Dinki, two assistants. Hey, do you remember them? It's been so long. How d'you do?
Have a conversation. You're not a formal person, so a formal statement could come off as insincere. So you're saying I should just... be myself? Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way.
The night Brother Sam carried Nick from his apartment... Nick fired a shot at him. From the couch, I'm guessing, since he was stoned. So the bullet should be here. 9 millimeter.
We think that the doomsday tableaus are an enactment of these keys. Jesus. I thought this crazy fuck was trying to warn us about the end of the world. You're telling me he's trying to cause it? There's more.
She's a lowdown, dirty, sloppy second slurping bitch! You're right. She's a bitch. She... she stole my life. She stole my boyfriend.
You got another envelope? Yeah. I found this medal inside. It's called the Order of the Rising Sun. It was awarded to a Japanese pilot who bombed Pearl Harbor.
It's a detective's badge. But right now, this badge outranks your star. Don't make this personal, son. It's not personal. Need I rind you... Fleet week is a very lucrative endeavor.
Well, put on your arm floaties and swim for it. I guess I'll just hunker down in my cabin and try to ignore the sounds of breasts dragging down the corridor. Sir, how old are these women? I don't know-- 40? 90? Let's be honest. After 28, it's all the same.
Anyway, I'd love to stay, but tiffy's at the vet with volcanic diarrhea. That was a fun cab ride. So as they say in Australia, good day... Mate! Timmy, you got to use your giant brain and find me a way out of this. I don't know how, sir.
I'll get it. Unlock the door, Louise! We know you have the key. Nope. I ate it.
Not you, Hugo! Fair enough. We don't need you here anyway, you big, sour blanket. Who wants to see what I learned today in salsa class? Uh, guess I can go finish speed bus.
Why don't you trust me? It's the kind of thing we should have agreed upon first. Each of us should have veto power. Artie will agree with me, right, Artie? One, I have veto power over both of you.
I had enough of labouring like a maniac. But everything is screwed. Now, here I'm deprived of identity, forced to live hidden like a rat. I can not believe it. It's impossible.
- Oh, right. Um, ahem. Listen, uh, Logan, the other night, um, you know... - ... I hope you didn't get the wrong idea. - About what?
And... Sorry, angel. The adults in this town have done enough harm. We're gonna finish this one on our own. Please, you have to believe me.
I need to take care of my family. What, they can't take care of themselves? Don't bother. I'll find them alone. How?
No, you're... No. Maybe her spirit came to you. - Yeah! Of course.
! Jesus, Ryan! What happened? I thought everyone calls him that. Not to his face.
I could never live up to that. Because it's not you. It is the promise of you. This is all of us. Face it. If Bridget were predictable, you would eventually lose interest.
Really? I got to sit? A woman's heart is a deep and mysterious place, almost impossible to reach. Much like the G-spot. Although at least we know the heart, in fact, exists. Can I stand up now? Oh, no. H-hang on.
It would be bad to use this material to make money. But I think I should be allowed to use it if I don't make money. The cultural industry must start understanding people like Pep, its future clients. It has to accept that Pep will never buy music on CDs, or films on DVD. Royalties Societies have designed educational campaigns for young people dealing with Intellectual Property...
But I think we are transitioning to a new model of business and a new model of relations between authors and consumers of information. Internet is creating problems like paedophilia, among other things... New technology is not necessarily good. At some point, we'll have to regulate it. These corporations that systematically infringe citizens' rights:
Paradoxically, this doesn't harm their business. Traficantes de Sueños is a book store, a publishing house, an alternative distributor... a design studio and a social centre. We publish texts we consider interesting and position them in places that will have a good reception. From the moment Creative Commons Licenses began, we found them very useful. When we use these licenses, it makes sense that the texts are available online.
Dr. Pierre Toussaint, 45. Working visa says he moved here three years ago from Haiti. Collapsed an hour ago in full respiratory arrest. First observation, I'm guessing this to be the murder weapon. A hypodermic needle?
Come on. You were taking advantage of Laurie's addiction. She needed oxy, which she got from you in exchange for sex. And she helped Toussaint set you up in exchange for more Oxy. You're wrong, detective, and I certainly never gave Toussaint money for a DVD I didn't even know existed.
Come here, sweetie. Breathe. - Birgitte, where is she? - In some ward. We've sedated her. Reactions can be severe, if you go off your medicine abruptly.
I want to own something. Like what? Real estate, and not just some dumpy plot of land on the South Side. I want something beautiful. Why would people get mad about that?
- You. Why me? I cannot say it like this. It's the question of your respect. How do you drive the car?
I will try my best. But we cannot deny the fact that all evidence, all charges in Rakesh Kadam's case are against him. Sir, you have said so much then say it confidently.. ...my husband was guilty. Kavya, I used to bring your grandma here all the way to Shinoll 30 kilometres on a cycle from our village to see a film.
So, um, we're good? Yeah, of course. So are you guys going to this thing tonight or sitting it out on historical grounds? No, I think me and the other inbreds will make an appearance. All the girls in my cabin are very excited.
Killer's too smart to leave a trail like that, huh? Lucky for you, I'm smarter. I figured out what poison was used to kill Aaron. Salt sodium nitrite. Looks and tastes just like table salt.
Among them is what has become known as the Totem of the Lost Tribe. My dad wants to see that. Said they found in a cave, like it had been hidden. I still don't get the connection. It was discovered in the Mojave Desert.
She doesn't drink for the buzz. I don't drink for the buzz. Once you get the buzz is when you should stop. We drink to get fucking plastered. The party does not end.
♪ I'll never see the end ♪ ♪ I'll never love another ♪ ♪ I'll miss you forever ♪ Things started off pretty hot and heavy and like it used to be with Jaq and I when I first got to San Francisco. But by the end, I think something weird shifted, and we never had time to really talk about what was going on with us.
You're wanted in six states on counts of kidnapping, extortion, and murder. Listen to me. I'm innocent! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. (Charlie) Once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble.
I just thought you were dangerous. You were right. If you're thinking about tracking my location off the camera feed, don't waste your time. You always did plan ahead. And I see that you have some new women in your life.
I'm... I'm kidding. I'm an actuary. Oh, wow, an actuary. I have no idea what that is. It's an insurance thing. Uh, how 'bout you?
Why'd they tear it down? You okay, Chief? - Oh, I'm fine! - Be careful. Tell her, Mike. The contractor never pulled a permit in the first place.
And in the meantime, if I'm gonna be paying S.I.S. overtime to sit on the Kings' house all weekend, I'd like to see some kind of compelling evidence that connects them to this case. Besides lying about the fight that they had with Mr. Dale and finding him buried in their backyard? Yes. Besides that. Well, how about this, then? The victim was 6 feet tall, over 200 pounds.
The piano. The puck machine. Is there anything else that you would have fixed there? Help! - I'm here. This thing can kill her right now.
Even in Bloodwork? Mostly Heartbreak Ridge. Please continue. I am somewhat recently divorced, I believe there is little to no room for interpretation when it comes to the United States constitution, and I have an unusually high threshold for pain.
Especially since he's only been dead for... Check the neck. Check the wrists. What's this? Looks like our killer might have left us a little present. What a shame.
I'm Blacula! And you're going to be under arrest you succubus. Hold on. There's is no way she could have committed this murder, she has an airtight alibi. Carlton, somebody called a vampire bar asking to buy a lot of blood.
Oliver? All right, rooks, everybody knows that Friday shifts are bad. There's more drunk and disorderlies and more, uh, more domestics. Friday night, full moon, that's a a hole different story. Diaz.
Two females, mid-20s. Do we have to attend a hair-pulling contest? Patients are of Russian descent. Fuck. Not going in there without police protection.
And you've shit taste in music. Wait till you're out the car to beat him up, you'll get a much better swing on your punch. We're going to cut you out. We'll be quick as we can, OK? Yeah.
The Intersect opened me up to big dreams. But in order for those dreams to become a reality, I need this business to succeed, and... You think the company doesn't work if you don't have the Intersect? I don't think that Dad wanted you to have the Intersect forever. And besides, you don't need it.
Well, there is one thing. The weirdest thing is that nobody stopped us. I'm gonna save a fortune, keeping him here instead of in the stables. When did you put this whole horse-in-my-yard thing together? I can't help it.
Wouldn't want to poke the sleeping bear, Andrew. She doesn't want to come home after a hard day's work and deal with my theatrics. Her words. Maybe that's exactly what she wants. Maybe this is all about trying to get a rise out of you.
All right, ladies, let's push back into our downward dog. There's a lot of tension in your hips. Easy does it. Last guy I let back there had to buy me a ring. Ooh, this is one for the bachelorette party. You owe me $600 for these alligator shoes.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli? Religiously. Then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night. Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students. Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
- New suit, dean? New dean, vice dean. I see that you used school funds to buy an espresso machine for your faculty break room. I don't recall being consulted on that. I don't consult you on anything. That's the problem.
You want a bribe? I can't be bought, man. You feel me? See, prison was my walls. But you put your walls up. You, and your phone, and your attitude, and your fruit loops cologne. Your walls put up so tight, not even a blade of grass could get through.
No. Uh, people? We have a problem. One beehive, one bee. We are missing the bee.
Wow, Sutton screwing over a friend. Who would ever see that coming? You don't know what you're talking about, Nisha. My palms are actually sweating. I hope Sutton's friends are going to be okay with, you know, us.
You are a natural at this, sweetheart, and you know that. And nobody ever pulled off a prank quite like Lemon Breeland. I-I still don't know how you got that cow into Mrs. Gleason's office, but watching her try to lure that thing down the stairs-- that was amazing. Okay, for the record, Mrs. Gleason was being terribly unfair about allowing me to retake the vocabulary test.
What would you have done if it were Diana? The paramedic said she's gonna be ok. I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt. I really didn't. With you here, we can do more.
Wait, this is the paper Jackie's getting published - on Theodore... - Géricault? He's this French painter... who painted. Yeah, in a word.
I saw "A" push Ian off that bell tower, and there was no hesitation. Spence, what are you saying? She's saying that it felt like it was easy for "A" to kill someone. And I only know one way to keep Toby safe, and that's to keep him away from me. I didn't make a call before. I'd like to make it now.
[Laughs] Not yet. First class in the future. I mean, Jaq is... you know, she's great, and we're good friends. We're, you know... but we don't have that chemistry.
Well, she found her way in. Maybe her kids did, too. Then God help them. Why do you say that? We can do a scan for life forms.
He looks so young! He said he'd keep on following me till I married him! Didn't like to make a scene! Just stay focused. Think of home.
He said he'd keep on following me till I married him! Didn't like to make a scene! Just stay focused. Think of home. This thing, it works psychically...
Whatever your brother's following... it's growing. Well, then we have to get after him! It's OK, you're fine. Don't worry. Is that tree... alive?
Well, then we have to get after him! It's OK, you're fine. Don't worry. Is that tree... alive? Of course it's alive, it's a TREE!
What did you mean, watch him die? Where's Father? Where is he? Where's Daddy? Why are you holding a telegram?
I don't want to turn you into a popsicle. Oh, Astrid- I'll get you one later, Walter. Grape, please. And one for my friend here. You just rest there.
Don't my foster parents have to be here when you question me? If you were actually 17, yeah, mm-hmm. I am 17. Yeah, and I'm about to charge you with murder. Why did you lie to us?
I couldn't touch. I couldn't cry out. The pain of that first drop of blood on my face was excruciating. But the thought of leaving her was even more excruciating, so I lay there... took the pain. Three days of her blood dripping on me, drying on me, enveloping me. And it was that blood... that saved me.
But it's the only way. Thank you. What are you doing here? Why have you got my sister? We're here to do a... a sort of a a soul transplant - we're going to bring you back to life. It's like a... it's like a liver transplant.
- Who? Someone with knowledge, access. The files are 20 years old. It had to be someone close. We need to make it to Friday... three days.
Okay, I've hurt my back. I'm shit-faced. Yeah, well, you downed that bottle of schnapps like it was a soda pop. Look, Roxy, I'm trying to give you a second chance here, but you're making it very difficult. Hey, this jacket is awesome.


Listen, a lot of prominent people come here, all right? Politicians, politicians' wives, and frankly, they expect some discretion. Yeah, we don't really care. Answer his question. Yeah, I-I heard rumors about Markus and some of his clients.
She is very talented and is beautiful. If you put it all together in this lovely package, has everything going for it. The difficult thing for a dancer right now is the fact that there very little employment. With this in mind, just follow your dream. It felt good.
You're working your body maximum since we have about five years. They are beautiful in ballet slippers, but when you take them off, are not as nice. They have a torn ligament or have a stress fracture and may be out for a year. Well, that can make shatter a career. Which causes further working with injuries when they should not.
And this week is the 10th anniversary of the massacre. And today is the first day of a 4-day event to commemorate the bombing at the school. Except commemorating it isn't enough for this unsub. He wants to relive it. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
Tibbs is a man on the verge. He is a man on the threshold of murder, possibly even mass murder. Now who wouldn't want to try and stop that kind of nightmare? Theoretical criminology. I took that class. I think it's fascinating.
Educated guess. He had it circled in his calendar. Well, then why on earth wouldn't you clear the area first? The plan that was approved by, uh... you was to catch Tibbs in the act, I believe. You know that psychopathy test I gave Tibbs?
I-I found this picture of little Tallis being held up. Is that you? - Me with younger hands. - Mm-hmm. And I noticed that the wedding ring in the picture doesn't match the one on your hand.
So this is the end? Good luck in San Francisco. What time did you get home last night? Hmm? You know, the movie?
Billy Garrity wants me to text him my picture. Which one should I wear-- "put me to bed" I just answered my own question. Okay. Penny, no. Do your mothers know that you dress like this?

Get this right. Just sit and you watch and listen. Now, this is a glass of vodka to you and I. But to Tommy, this is what it is... A great big shot of fire.
Can I ask you something? What's up with those socks? - Clown college. - Uh-huh. I go at night. Seriously?
Well, after the day I had, I'll finish the bottle myself. This P.T.A. Gig is turning into a serious pain in the ass. Yeah. I show up the teensiest bit late, and the girls are all over me. They're like, "Gaby, why are you late? You should be sad and miserable and on time, just like us."
Whoa. Where's the attitude coming from? We made is place a success. No. This place is supposed to feed homeless people. It's a dismal failure. It's for the hungry and the poor... the people we walk past every day.
My ring fell off. You had to have shag carpeting, huh? Ugh. That gay guy at my office said shag was back. Really need to start getting my style tips from someone else. Damn it. Where is it?
I mean, we're in this together, and we have to trust each other. Okay, great. You're so right. I just--we've been dancing around this thing all day. No one will just, you know, come out with it.
You're just doing your job. I've got a job, too. And I do it sometimes. But this is an emergency, okay? We've got a guy who is five beers away from turning into the Ders.
And I told them, "11." So that's how strong it is. Graphic details have already been printed in today's "commercial appeal." Jessie misskelley Jr., is one of three of the murder suspects. I don't believe it. He's not that type of boy. Misskelley, sr., disputes a confession allegedly made by his son and quoted in today's newspaper.
None of the defendants could be the source of that hair on the ligature. Take a look at just how much support they have-- thousands of postcards, some as far away as Los Angeles, California, and Europe, all supporting the west Memphis three. Did you murder the little boys? Well, I'd have to laugh at that and say there's something wrong with someone who would think that. That stepfather denies having anything to do with the murders.
He assumed the mantle. And now he suddenly has a house to take these kids to. Wait. Garcia said the mother jumped off of a bridge, right? Yeah. Why? What are you thinking? Suicidology is an imperfect science, but it's uncommon for women to kill themselves so violently.
At some point, he either picks her up, or she gets up, and he smashes her face into this. Wow. What's his ex-girlfriend's name--Kasey? Yeah. I hope she knows how lucky she is.
I went from being stuck in my parents' house to being stuck in my Maw Maw-in-law's house. I guess I'll never get to see the world's largest anything. Unless that's the world's largest ponytail. Nah, there's a guy in Tucson who's got three more inches. Damn it. - You could come with me.
I'm John. I'm Kate. Kate Leman. Photos are some kind of sick trophies of his victims. Benton convinces these women to do coke with him slips them a sedative and rapes them.

Throat cut ear to ear, but strangled, too. Guess we're looking for a guy who wears a belt and suspenders. What's up with the flowers? Lilies, tulips... Probably fresh, what, a week?
They just look dull and depressing. There's no contrast. Why would I wear a condom at the gym? Maybe because you're screwing that twink trainer of yours. And I need gourds.
Like hell she did. Brenda, you tell 'em? No, not yet. Everyone... I have wonderful news. Jeff and I are getting married.
! Look at this. I think this is the golf bag Walter found in the trailer. That's what you did, didn't you? You came back here to get all your incriminating evidence. What?
Have these cameras been rolling the whole time? Yep, from the moment they dropped it to when the tornado hit. It's not pointed at the Suttons' trailer, but it should show us anyone on the street. There's our intrepid storm chasers putting it down. Walter, is that vehicle leaving?

You didn't do that? Adrie, did you do that? - Yes. Goddammit, Adrie. That car is brand new.
I'll get her signed out. You held up emily. The lord will hold up you. She needs to learn to support herself. A man once was invited to visit both heaven and hell.
This guy is really careful, so make sure you get everything you can. Even though she I.D.'d him doesn't mean we don't need forensics. - Got it. - Okay, he drugs his victims, GHB usually. If the hospital hasn't already, you should take blood.
I found one of her private groups. She sent this out to them. What the hell is this? This is a game. You single out a virgin in the school and seduce her into believing that she's popular.
In previous cases, when the victim suffered a fatal fall from substantial height, I routinely found a concentric fracture around the foramen magnum. Where the spinal column had been driven through by force. Libby's skull is pristine. Now, given these findings, I took a closer look at other areas of her body and noticed... Her hyoid bone was broken. Suggesting strangulation.
Yeah. It's odd no contusions emerged on her neck - even after refrigeration. - You know, it is possible that she could've been strangled with something like a sleeveless shirt or a towel. Spreading out the trauma, making it indiscernible. What about that necklace she was wearing?
You come up here for the cowboy experience. You're looking at him. Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband? Yes. Really? I think you better move away from that woman.
At least let him grill you a steak in his fireplace while watching black and white television. It's more charming than you'd think. I'll pass. You know what, I do have a list of girlfriends that might make good candidates. They can't just be good.
No, it's... Look, until you agree to move in with me, you have no right to question my decor. Now I'm in trouble. I'm serious. What do you think?
Jack's Pride. You would have lost all our money, all over a woman. Mary Barrett isn't just any woman. What did I tell you about women? They're like wild horses.
I gotta say, just lifting Amy all day really crushes my 'ceps, you know? Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I was talking to Amy. So was I.
Mary Bastholme. Carol Cooper. Lucy Partington. Shirley Hubbard. Those women didn't stay at your house.
Director. It's Lee Jung Woo. What is it? I found the message Dr. Kim Myung Guk left behind. He left a message?
One water. JULIETTE: Bees usually sting when threatened or provoked. Did you kick a hive or something? No, they just came out of nowhere, headed straight for yours truly. Aw, maybe you were their flower. Excuse me? Bees are highly effective communicators.
Very flattering. Iona, I mean it. What am I to you? Do you know what feelings between a man and a woman really are? I've got a tough time ahead.
Go ahead. What's it look like, Ricky? It's not bad, boss. Not bad ain't gonna cut it for me, man. Those plates are straight from the U.S. Department of Printing and Engraving.
I don't know why I'm quoting a rapist. Can't we just stay a little bit longer? We don't have any A.C. at home. I have an A.C. you girls can use. You have an air conditioner that works?
It's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet, or know, or even talk to. Message in a bottle, the postman-- Kevin Costner. So... I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Look what old Rudy found in his jeans this morning. The digits! So are you going to call her? No! No, I'm not. And I'll tell you why.
Me. But I was the only one available to try them on. Of course. 'Cause you couldn't wait to see what I wanted. There's only one person in this room who looks good in peach, and who might that be?
You're gonna act like this never happened. We live together. We're a family. Families talk about things. No.
Hard enough to knock herself out. She's self-injuring, Liz. I thought we were getting past it. "It"? Five months ago,
I thought we were getting past it. "It"? Five months ago, Chloe and her best friend Lauren, they were coming into the city, to see Wicked. Lauren drove.
Well, that's not me. Even with a history of drug use? Where'd you hear that? More than once I've heard you say, "Soccer is my high now." That was just talk, man.

Oh, the bully might be winning right now, but my time will come. Time will come. No, your time is now, Brick. You got to stand up to this guy, and let him know that he can't mess with you. Actually, I find that most bullies just want to feel heard.
Now, look, before you say no, why don't you pop by this week and hear me out. You open your kimonos, I'll open mine. You might just like what you see. Yeah, we'll noodle on that, Scott. Sure thing.
It was this ability that would help her come up with an ingenious idea, one that would help unravel the true size of the universe. The idea rested on finding an objective way of defining the true brightness of a star. Leavitt became fascinated by a type of star known as a Cepheid variable, which pulses in the night sky. Her breakthrough was discovering that their brightness was precisely related to the speed they blinked. Let me explain.
Let me explain. Imagine that I'm in a distant galaxy that you can see from Earth. As the space between us stretches, there will come a time in the future when it is expanding so rapidly that light can't outrun it, and the galaxy will disappear from view. What this means is that, far into the future, some 100 billion years from now, if intelligent life forms still exist in our galaxy, they'll look out into space and see only the stars in our own Milky Way. All the other galaxies will have disappeared.
In them, he detailed how he'd taken Gauss's ideas on curved surfaces, and generalised them, so that they applied not only to curved two-dimensional surfaces, but the curvature of space in any dimension. OK, so I'm sure this all sounds rather complicated. What exactly do we mean by curved space in any dimension? So let me try and explain. Here's the thing, Gauss talked about curved two-dimensional surfaces.
Hubble knew that, as a light source approaches us, the light wave would become compressed and appear blue. If an object was receding, the light waves would become stretched out and appear red. What he saw was astounding. All distant galaxies were being red shifted. They were all moving away from us.
Here it is just a few hundred thousand years old. At this point, something very strange happens, because the universe suddenly becomes transparent to visible light as atoms form. It's as though a fog has lifted and light is suddenly able to travel freely through the universe. At every point in space, photons began to travel unimpeded and the entire universe is filled with a blinding light. But this light, released in the hot turmoil of the early universe, didn't stay bright for ever.
Right. Now, since Newton's time, gravity was thought to be a force that pulls all objects together. So if I drop this apple, it's as though there's an invisible rubber band that's pulling it down towards the earth. But Einstein's general theory of relativity gives us a completely different picture, and a totally new perspective. So although gravity appears to be a force, it's nothing more than the curvature of space itself.
And it turned out it was. It just happened to be in a rather unusual form. As unlikely as it sounds, the relic of the Big Bang fireball was actually visible on television. Let me explain how this is possible. Imagine this balloon is our universe.
This feels desperate. Take a look at this. There was blood on the body that didn't match type to the victim. It shows a severely low white blood cell count. I'm running tests to be more conclusive.
We just don't want to burden our little angel with all kinds of gender-specific expectations. Boys can do ballet; girls can play football. Hell, the Green Bay Packers have been proving that for years. That would've gotten a big laugh at a sports bar. Well, I say define gender roles early.
I don't know how you guys do it. Don't worry. You'll get used to it. Did you see Nick Dalton with Frances Dunhill? I thought he was dating Carol-Lynne.
Well, why didn't you say anything? 'Cause everybody comes here with some sort of baggage. I figured it wasn't any of my business. What do you mean "baggage"? Well, it's not any girl who just applies to be a Playboy Bunny, right?
Why are you carrying that? Maybe because you had reason... to visit the colored section of town? Why don't you come down to the precinct, Mrs. Langdon? I knew it. What'd I tell you?
How did I know you'd be back? I haven't been able to get this house out of my mind. Mrs. Harmon is out. But I'd be happy to show you whatever you want to see. As you can see, this room belongs to a sad, depressed teenager.
- Yeah, I'm serious. It's funny. - Loser. - Yeah. Do you think anyone's gonna notice I've worn this costume before when I wasn't pregnant?
- She looks amazing. - Yeah. What a nice surprise to see Danielle after so long. Yeah, it was a surprise, I'm sure. Yeah, a welcome one.
Yeah, a welcome one. You know, the Swedish women today, they're always trying so hard to be something that they're not, but, Danielle, she's so comfortable with herself. She always has been. Magnus, what are you saying? I'm saying that, sometimes, things can take a long time.

It was a heavy-duty reusable glass water bottle. That doesn't make any sense. I mean, how do you get three times with a glass bottle? It would break! The water bottle uses a thick glass, very high tensile strength.
Even as a young man he was prone to dishonesty - Who knows what path he is on now. You want the egg to remain lost forever! I don't want it to get into Borden's hands. The tomb of Askhanar has lain untouched for more than 400 years.
Well, the fact that she has sex with me buys her a lot of goodwill. I'm so sick of her telling me what to do. I realize sometimes she can come off like kind of a pit bull, but just remember, it's coming from a very caring place. Neither of them like anybody I bring home. Doesn't matter if it's an unemployed drummer or a married orthodontist who likes bread.
His house is not gonna be a low priority. Good point. Wait. The dining room's on the other side of that wall. Yeah, so?
It wasn't a collective "you". It was a singular "you", ie me. Sir, we may have something. Jamie's been tracing the video's origin. I thought it was untraceable. Technically, yes, so I thought, "Work with what we do now"
- Which is why I couldn't tell her. - What? Well... I just couldn't do it on the phone. She seemed so excited to hear from me, and I'm very bad at disappointing people, Mitchell. Not all people.
I'm Andre. Nice to meet you, Phil. Nice to meet you, Andre. So I guess I was wrong when I said once you get older, it's harder to make new friends. Honey! The dude in the tree is cool!
It's a subsonic signature. Only certain insects are capable of hearing it. 42.8 Hunzel to be precise. You know, Malcolm, I am all for the onward march of science, but I just don't see how this is going to help me catch a spy. It seems to me that whoever it is, has got to be wondering why they didn't get their last message, right?
It says it went into the house. Is this the house I think it is? Can't be. The Shannons. Could that body you found really be the General Richard Philbrick?
- "Bet you I do"? - Yeah. She won. - She deserves a drink. I forgot her coral necklace. It dies if you don't wear it.
And I can make myself scarce. A few of my friends have been suggesting a girls' night. Maybe I'll call 'em. No maybe. You're going to call them, and you're going to have a great time.
Do you have any idea what Sam was doing in New York? Wasn't like him. He hated the city. Yo, Tommy. You know what I need? I need my luck to change.
Don't you wanna beat this thing? Is getting Stroh worth risking our whole future? You're right, I'm sorry. Sorry, I know you're right. Sometimes I hold onto things longer than I should.
You're right, I'm sorry. Sorry, I know you're right. Sometimes I hold onto things longer than I should. But you have to know... there is nothing I want more than to get rid of Gavin... and Goldman and this whole terrible lawsuit... so that the future can go back to what it used to be. I'd be happy if our guest room goes back to what it used to be.
That didn't sound good. I think we might have a problem. Of course, if you can't set it up properly, you might as well knock on your target's front door. - What the hell was that? - Damn it!
- We can talk about it. No. I think you did me a favor. I think... I need to get away from all this tragedy.
Yeah, I was, um, I was crouched down by the bed. Which side? The right side. Which means you could see the door.
- What are these? - Tiny apples. And those? Halloween apples. These berries are green now, 'cause they're just pulled from the vine.
No plates, no registration. Have to run the VIN by the DMV. Gus... Check out the tiny apples. The berries are green now 'cause they're just pulled from the vine.
- You said that already. The three of us will bask in golden light and liberate our inhibitions. Um, are you crazy? Love will abound, Gus. My love doesn't abound like that.
The three of us will bask in golden light and liberate our inhibitions. Um, are you crazy? Love will abound, Gus. My love doesn't abound like that. - But it can.
I didn't like it either, but I couldn't control my son's social life. - Your son have a lot of money on him? - I have no idea. Why would that be pertinent? Two people were murdered.
- Your son have a lot of money on him? - I have no idea. Why would that be pertinent? Two people were murdered. We think they were both at the crash site.

Mm-hmm. Only that one woman, Rebecca. We're both in line for the vice principal job, and she's just jealous and I'm a better teacher. Rug don't match the drapes, huh? Women don't really have rugs anymore, Peggy. Dear lord, thank you for this food.
Actually, I think you're both under house arrest until we catch this guy. Oh, I can only imagine how this sniper must be affecting Beckett. She says she's fine. So what are you gonna do? The only thing I can do-- try to figure out why he's leaving these damn dolls behind.
I'm fine. What's in the folder? CSU report on the paper doll. This was not made by a kid. It was cut out very precisely with an X-Acto knife. Out of what, a magazine?
I mean, really. - Trust me, I smell the match. Classic shop and plop cover-up. Where are the two Kit Kats we got from the vending machine? I told you I was hungry.
I thought you'd be here. When my old man found out I was trying for MI6 he told me, "Kenny boy, people like us don't do things like that." Well, he wasn't being cruel. It was just the way saw things. Well, maybe he was right.
Okay, see you soon. I combed the entire area. No trace anywhere. They got away. Don't move. Our mole must have got cut trying to get away.
Yeah, and I'm, uh, buzzing pretty good, so just buzz off, Buzzter. Shut up! You tried to kill the only thing that means anything to me in this [Bleep] World. Now, gimme your car keys or I'll rip your dicks off and [Bleep] You in the holes that it leaves. She takes premium!
No ma'am, it's Saturday all right, you slept all day Friday. I expect you was tired out after your journey. But how did I get here. Where is this? Why ma'am, you're right here in your new home, that's been ready and waiting for you for over a week. Expecting you every day I was after getting the wire to say your  <hon>folks<hoff> had taken 'Sea House' and wanted it scrubbed and cleaned.
How do I know this friend of yours will ever get here? I got a letter off to him. They thought it was just a blank sheet of paper but I had a second  <hon>letter<hoff>, I fooled them. I really sent that. - When did you post it?
If you'd married this girl, you would have been wretched, and so in time would she have been. I assure you, the whole thing would have been an absolute failure. I remember your saying once, there's a fatality about good resolutions. They're always made too late. -Mine certainly were. -You should look upon this tragedy as an episode in the wonderful spectacle of life. What is it that has really happened? Someone has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I'd had such an experience.
-You should look upon this tragedy as an episode in the wonderful spectacle of life. What is it that has really happened? Someone has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I'd had such an experience.  <hon>The women<hoff> who have admired me, and there have been some, have always insisted on living on long after I have ceased to care for them or they to care for me. They've become stout and tedious.
Miss Vane, has Sir Tristan, as you have so charmingly called him, ever invited you to see the wonderful portrait that Basil Hallward has made of him? No, he hasn't. I should love to see it. Of course you may, darling. Tonight, if you wish.
No. I shall be out of England for several months. I'm going to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up until I finish a picture I have in my head. Gladys is coming over to join me later on. May I come in for a moment? Won't you miss your train?
It's nice to see my old assistant. The youngest, but the best one I ever had. But who knows now. As my old friend Zannenbaum used to say, " <hon>Women<hoff> make the best psychoanalysts,
The youngest, but the best one I ever had. But who knows now. As my old friend Zannenbaum used to say, " <hon>Women<hoff> make the best psychoanalysts, "till they fall in love.
This is the secret of old age. Everything becomes just the opposite. Do you know who makes the most trouble in the world?  <hon>Old people<hoff>. They are always worrying what is going to be in the world tomorrow after they are gone.
Someone's been here since my time. Alex didn't think anything. He's sweet. He may be sweet, but he didn't even ask us where our bags were. Alex is always like that, in a complete dream state socially.
Emily, l-- -Half an hour? -Make it 1 5 minutes. All right. Only a few  <hon>stars<hoff> left.
-You said grace before, Dad. -Yeah. I did? Well, I'm gonna keep on saying it all day. I just hope he stays like he is till the  <hon>judges<hoff> see him.
Attention, please. Attention. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor of introducing to you a man whom you all know: Congressman James A. Goodheart. During this great day of boar judging you have seen hundreds of seemingly perfect boars eliminated leaving only two contestants: The Junior Champion and the Senior Champion, both perfect specimens representing excellence of breeding.
As a matter of fact, he's just no good, period. She liked him, though. Sort of knocked her out for a while. Come to think of it, you're the first guy she's looked at since then. I guess I just don't understand the  <hon>people<hoff> in your business.
Thas all it is. Oh it ain't fun some times, but, don't you be afraid. You're so nice, Papa. I guess is better if you don't just stay young all your life. Ill be much nicer growing up.
You're an awful bad liar. But you're a very good man. I'm ashamed I didn't know before. No, it isn't that, Madame. Johnny... Johnny always talked about his family like... like folks ought to, only they don't. And whenever he talked about it he always made you feel better, or you wanted to laugh.
You know, Mrs. Bennett, you'd think the people in this town... would have something better to do than figuring out ways to get rid of each other. The whole thing may seem very humorous to you... I'm sorry. Your husband's been convicted. The case is closed...
You drunk again? Yes. Took you a long time to answer the door. It's a great relief being divorced from you, Sleepy dear. Give me the money and I'll go.
But here, if you start in some school or suburban concert hall oh, it's much too difficult. It takes too long. I know. And you have had such a bad time. But no more. After all, I know  <hon>people<hoff>.
Oh, here's some pâté. Chock-full of vitamins. Just what you need. Yes? This place? Is it...?
Mother, please don't. It's okay, Mom. We're sorry. Come on, Kim, let's feed the dogs. Allowing them to go to a ball game.
It's okay, Mom. We're sorry. Come on, Kim, let's feed the dogs. Allowing them to go to a ball game. They like it, they always went with Paul.
We're sorry. Come on, Kim, let's feed the dogs. Allowing them to go to a ball game. They like it, they always went with Paul. People like to do a great many things they don't do, Jessica.
Two more, please. - Yes, ma'am. Well, did the boys get off all in one piece? Yes, they've gone. Ginna, isn't it awful the way things happen between parents and  <hon>children<hoff>?
Nothing surprises him. But if you showed him a calf with two heads, that would disturb him. And yet, a calf a simple calf, with one head, such as yours or mine... It's very strange, in fact inexplicable, when you think about it. When I say "a calf", I could as easily say a tree or an egg. What a mystery, the chicken or the egg!
You saw me? When? It wasn't long ago. It's an entire story that I've invented. The most beautiful girl in the world.
It's addressed to you. Cora wrote it. It's a very beautiful note, Frank written by a girl who loved a man very much. I imagine it was written earlier the very night she died. A note of farewell, isn't it? She did try and run away that night.
Have you ever thought of going to the East? India, for instance? I went there. I met a strange man. A man I never thought to meet in this world. A saint.  <hon>People<hoff> go from all parts of India to see him tell him their problems, ask his advice and listen to his teaching.
I'm not running in the Olympic Games, you know. It'll all have to be done over immediately. Now, about this robe. It's really dreadful. Dreadful. And look at this tassel. Hideous. It should strike me here, at the knees, lower, lower so that when I walk, it'll sway.
Well, my family weren't quite that impulsive. Father courted Mother through high school, college and law school. Fourteen years after they met, they got married. They had a lot in common. They were both attorneys. You feel nice in my arms.
-You going to the picnic? -Well, I was, but-- How'd you like to use my car? -You're kidding. -No. I'd like to borrow yours.
I have remembered that. Do you see that crate? Sausages! They will eat sausages. Europeans eat sausages wherever they go.
- Anyway, there aren't any patients yet. - Aren't there? There are dozens waiting. And more coming every minute. Now, tell them to go away and help me with the ones that are left. Sister Blanche,  <hon>these girls<hoff> are to work in your lace school. They were sent by the General.
Let me help you. What is worrying you? I remember things, before I joined our order. Things I wanted to forget. I never thought of them until now.
Mopu Palace stands in the wind on a shelf on the mountain. It was built by the General's father to keep his women there. It's called a palace, but there may be a slight difference between your idea of a palace and the General's. Anyhow, there it is. The people are like mountain peasants everywhere, simple and independent.
Yes. Yes, it is, rather. I don't mean to do anything wrong again. I'm going to give up being clever and famous. I'm going to be exactly like my ancestors. They were warriors and princes.
Well? Who was it? Oh, you. Mr Dean, do you think it's serious? Don't you think they'll come back? Sister Clodagh,  <hon>the agent<hoff> before my time was riding down to the factory one day on his pony.
Science contradicts that, Doctor. Nature proves that the weak must die... so that the strong may live. Authority... cleverness... imagination. Those are the real differences between men. these thieves and murderers... alone, unarmed.
You're hurt. Collins and Munsey are dead. And the others. All those others. Why do they do it? They never get away with it. Alcatraz. Atlanta. Leavenworth.
But is it over? You and your patent medicine remedies. Change the warden. New personnel. Do you know what this prison is, Mr. McCallum? One big human  <hon>bomb<hoff>. And you say, kick it and it'll be quiet.
If you like me so much, leave me alone. Wait a minute, son. Will radak and reynolds leave you alone? I've got to be around. Wherever you go, they go after you. Listen, ferrari. You saw me put my wife and kid on that bus.
Where are you headed for? St. Paul. What have you got in the truck? Some junk for the county fair. You see anything of a <hon>man and a woman<hoff> on the highway today, young couple? I wish i had. We've been stopped 10 times today on account of them.
We love you so much. Ferrari: Very tender. Very touching. A nice kid you got, steve. They'll like it in california. Hello, mr. Ferrari.
I didn't change the melody at all, honest. It's just the way you wrote it. - Oh, I'm not, it's just... - Let me play it for you. Anne, sing it for him, won't you?

Why, you ought to be ashamed. Maybe they're right about your voice. Shh! Danny, Danny. If you hate teaching kids, that's probably why your voice is cold. Maybe it'd warm up if you took some interest in them instead of just yourself.
Maybe they're right about your voice. Shh! Danny, Danny. If you hate teaching kids, that's probably why your voice is cold. Maybe it'd warm up if you took some interest in them instead of just yourself. You know, most people want something and they're never happy until they get it.
What's the matter with you? Haven't you never been to the movies? Take t <hon>he hero and the heroin<hoff>e. How do they start out? Fighting, like you and Annie. Why?
It's brilliant! Only you could have thought it up. For God's sake! - Eduardo already knows I'm poor. - But <hon>his parents<hoff> don't.
Yes, I can see I'll be 'wind-less' in the prow! It's a good boat, but it's not worth a pinnace to me. A pinnace? You mean a penny. A pinnace! The other two-masted  <hon>ship<hoff>.
It was with this rifle, as a matter of fact. - Watch out. - Don't worry, it's not loaded. Sr Anastácio, don't make me suffer any more. Tell me.
Who would ever have thought that she'd still be here, In Venice... that house. Have you seen  <hon>her<hoff>? No, I doubt if anyone ever se <hon>es her. Except her niece, miss Tina Bordereau, an<hoff>d her servants. They're expecting me, there'll be no slip-ups? No, I left a deposit of 50 franks with the housekeeper.

And my control. I would be very careful, Mr. Burton. If I had any hope of finding the letters quickly, they were soon dispelled. I was in a blind alley. I never so caught a glimpse of  <hon>Ms. Juliana or Ms. Tina.<hoff>
- not to be shared with anybody. - Tina? To would've known that kind of love, - to have filled one's life... - Tina, listen to me.  <hon>Men<hoff> like Jeffrey Ashton happen very rarely.
That's the one. He's a psychologist, you know? Well, that's a debatable point. Why is it bad? Sure. He says that  <hon>guys<hoff> who dress up like Santa Claus and give presents do it because when they was young they must have did something bad and they feel guilty.
-Honestly! -It's the best defense. -Completely illogical and unexpected. -And completely idiotic. What about your  <hon>bosses<hoff>, Haislip and Mackenzie? What do they say?
Yes, I have, Your Honor. I'd like to submit the following facts in evidence. It's the post office an official agency of the United States government. The post office was created by the 2nd Continental Congress on July 26, 1776. The first postmaster general was Benjamin Franklin. The post office is one of the largest concerns in the world.

But I must play. Playing the piano is my life. It was your life. It will be again. But for the moment, you must try and think of yourself As being in a deep sleep between today and tomorrow.
- I wasn't happy, I... - Sad? No, I just existed. I never realized what a dreary life it was, till I met you. David, I want a monopoly on you.
Is that what's wrong with me? I didn't know you had any knowledge of the subject... or I shouldn't have discussed it. I knew there was something wrong with me when I came up here. I had no idea it was insanity. Insanity's not a word we like to use, Mrs. Smith.
Go to sleep, baby... Jeff, do you ever get tired Of cooking for all these parties? I wouldn't worry about that if I was you, colonel.  <hon>Women<hoff> got a certain number of parties in their system,

Why is brock frightened, sarah beth? Doesn't he know mack can get him off? But he knows he can't get you off. The man brock shot, he called brock names. Not pretty  <hon>names<hoff>, either.
I thought you didn't know Manchester. No, but I go there, in my dreams. What are you getting at. I heard this convict got a load of buckshot in his back. Too bad.

Why is the dog... Don't look. No one has a chance in this wilderness. Nobody can fight it. It'll always be wilderness.
Chief Genowah, that mangy polecat. Three times he comes to the fort with his white flag and his promises. "Surrender," says he, "and you'll all go free." When the grub run out, everybody started yelping to run up the white flag. I warned them, but nobody'd listen.
Do you expect miracles? We cannot be ready for four months. Four months? There won't be a live settler west of the mountains. Then pull your settlers back.
Do you know what I think? - Don't think. Just feel. I might have known - no woman can think! Now wait! Darling, no woman should try. Thinking is the prerogative of men.

-Still sweating it out. RAF Mosquitoes have reported a formation of U.S. Fortresses under very heavy fighter attack 15 miles east of Braunschweig. What' s your report on morale, Haley? After the last two days, they're too tired to bother about morale. How many crews are making their last mission today?
Thanks, chum. -Strike signal? -Still sweating it out. RAF Mosquitoes have reported a formation of U.S. Fortresses under very heavy fighter attack 15 miles east of Braunschweig. What' s your report on morale, Haley?
Yesterday was a bloody massacre. Won't today be worse? -I don't like your language, Mr. Brockhurst. -I'm sorry, general but even a dumb civilian can tell you've got a maximum effort out today. Maximum?
Six weeks ago, a German plane like that model landed on the number one strip at Ted's field. -Shot up? -Not a scratch. The pilot was a Czechoslovakian engineer. He'd been forced to work for the  <hon>Nazis<hoff>.
Eleven out of 36. That's almost 70 percent. Colonel Martin just called in. Eight miles southeast of the base. He sent three  <hon>ships<hoff> ahead for emergency landings.
-It's a fact, sir. The German radio just announced they destroyed 1 60 of our bombers today. Doubtless for the German boys' morale. You evidently don't think their high command likes to face the truth. Well, my observation is most professional soldiers think more about their political problems than the enemy.
Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee last. Comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By our lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked in its ring. Good my lord, will you see the  <hon>players<hoff> well bestowed?
You as your business and desire shall point you, for every man hath business... and desire such as it is, and from mine own poor part, look you, Ill go pray.

- My Lord is the King of Heaven. - Hm, that's a point. That's a point. But I am to lead the Dauphin's armies. To lead his armies? When did the Dauphin have an army?
You may be, but I must look at you. Are you a lad? - Let me tell you why we meet you here. - Well, tell us and let us go on. There is a party of Burgundian  <hon>soldiers<hoff> in our town.
Do you want to strike the army dumb? - This must begin with you. - You said you would give no order, Joan. Oh, but this is not a military order, sir. Surely you must see that. But the army that is to march on Orleans was raised in a holy cause.
- I have just negotiated a truce with Burgundy. - A truce? - That's madness. - It's been too much bloodshed. The Tourelles has been terribly torn, we need peace. Our  <hon>enemies<hoff> need peace, my King, but not you.
I never said that I was wise, I never said I was honest, I never said I was handsome. I'm not a particularly good person to be a King, but as long as I am a King, I will be a King. What do you know statecraft? What do you know of the experience which the heads of nations must stoop? A ruler must compromise and bargain with the lowest sort of people, even the enemy.
You say that you have had revelations from God. Can you tell us when it first happened? When I was thirteen years old, I heard a voice in my father's garden. It was at noon time in the summer.  <hon>The voice<hoff> was at my right, toward the church.
Who counselled you to throw off women's clothes and dress like a man? A thing indecent... and contrary to the teachings of the holy scriptures. For that I blame no one. Having lived among soldiers it was more fitting for me to wear man's clothes. But give me a woman's dress and I will wear it if you permit me to hear mass.
Isn't it cruel to take a baby away from its mother? A creature who's a disgrace to the whole village? Who can't even teach a child his prayers? Is it a crime to save a baby from a life of misery? These  <hon>women<hoff> can't provide for a child.

Very good. That's a tree. Tree. Yes. Water.
You're my wife. And you expect me to pay for the honor? You needn't worry. I'm not fooling myself about why you married me. And I know what started you on the idea.
- Mother, may we put Theodore to bed? - Yes. It just doesn't seem possible for a house with such small rooms. I've already explained. It's not so much the size of the rooms as it is the number. Is it essential for each of your daughters to have her own room with two closets and a bath? Yes. You see, my  <hon>daughters<hoff> are approaching womanhood and...
"You're sweet." Bye now. The day's work is over now. People are on their way home. They're tired. They're hot. They're hungry.
- We'll go home. We don't like this place - this fine city. You don't know who did it, huh? Not yet. Did you ever see this  <hon>ring<hoff>?
That's why she's dead now. Dear God, why wasn't she born ugly? Oh, what a heartache. You nurse a child, you raise it... pet it, you love it... and it ends like this. Another day... another ball of fire rising in the summer sky.
Don't bite your nails, honey. Very few stenographers are murdered. Read about that bathtub murder? I'll say. Some figure that dame had.
Mr. Craster is going to play The Red Shoes music... at every lunch, tea and dinner you take until we open. I see. In this way, you should become quite familiar with the music. Yes, I think I probably shall. The music is all that matters. Nothing but the music. Huh?
Thank you, Mr. Boudin. That's all. Well, I see it's mail day. From our t <hon>wo young re <hon>bels. <ho<hoff>ff>  Deserters.
In charge of what? Mr. Lermontov asked me to come here this morning. - Why? - He's engaged me. - Not as a dancer, I hope. Well, Mr. Ratov,  <ho <hon>n> Mr<hoff><hoff> . Ljubov wants it moved.
Mr. Robbins here claims that the week's receipts... ofhis roadhouse were taken from his safe tonight. You were at that safe. Here's your note. I took $600 coming to me, that's all. I don't say that you took anything, Pete.
I'm up to getting you coffee if you like. Let's dispense with the charm. I'd like to know why you had the gall to tell Kenneth he wouldn't have to worry very much longer about David and me? I don't think that's precisely what I said, Kenneth. It's what you implied, and I want to know why.
And I'm sure you wouldn't want the poor, old man to have to get down on his knees to see them. Well, I think it looks downright peculiar. Peculiar? Very. Particularly those candlesticks. They don't belong there at all.
Good evening, Mrs. Wilson. What, may I ask, is happening to my table? We're just moving the things in here. Well... I personally thought  <hon>my table<hoff> was quite lovely.
What's the matter, Spike, can't you take it? Kid, you're in a rut. You're running out of stunts, aren't you? Boss, you're not going to spin this thing? Why not? I built it. Hope the  <hon>wings<hoff> stay on. So do I.
"in all of the world should be put in jail". I said, "Maria, what for you talk like a Communist"? She's, like, "Shut up! "Do you know why we got no peace? "Because we got no woman in the government". She said, "Put two roosters together. What happens?
I thought I could tell you that this country of ours is young. It's not old. That we've just begun to grow. I wanted to tell you that we Americans are the hope of the world. And the secret of our great plenty is freedom. And we've got to share that secret and that plenty with the other nations of the world. And I wanted to tell you that we face a great problem.
So what? I yelled my head off about labor and its responsibilities. I'm going to lay it right on the line for industry, too. Now, look here, Jim, you know just as well as I do that there are men at that banquet who'll be rooting for a depression, just so they can slap labor's ears back. And I suppose you have a few well-chosen words to say about tax reduction. You better not worry so much about tax reduction until we accomplish some of the things we have to accomplish.
The wife. Friends of Rebstock's. Yes. I should imagine. Well, if it ain't the little lady herself, slick as a daisy and twice as pretty. I sure am sorry if the  <hon>boys<hoff> have been disturbing your sleep these nights.
Sure will. Where do you want this barrel? Let's set it up over here, Frank. Easy, Murray. That case ain't even damaged.
Come on! Come on, Bill! One of you boys better help me plug up this hole. I left a trail a blind man could follow. I'll get it, Murray.
- I'd like to get something off my chest. - All right, go ahead. I can't argue law, and I won't try to. But fact is fact. These  <hon>men<hoff> came to Colorado to pan a fortune, the same as Mr. Carter. They had property when they left.
What side of this thing are you on anyhow? Your side. That's my job. But if you can name one man in this town who helped  <hon><hon>th<hoff>ose<hoff> men get a decent start, I'll eat your hat. - Why, I hired them. I... - Sure, sure, you hired them. At pay they couldn't live on.
Everyone was talking at the store. Owen, how can you hang five  <hon>men<hoff>? Five more? They had their trial. You convicted them on no more evidence than there was against Johnny Howard.
Owen, how can you hang five  <hon>men<hoff>? Five more? They had their trial. You convicted them on no more evidence than there was against Johnny Howard. Just because they were with him.
I'll wait. Don't be stupid, Leonora. Take this away, please. Look I told you, all these once before. Some  <hon>darlings<hoff> never know when they are well-off.
Did I ever apologize for bawling you out so badly? And what made you think of that? Was that because of the way I talked about marrying rich? It always makes me see red when people talk that way. My  <hon>parents<hoff> made themselves absolutely miserable by having an exaggerated idea about the importance of money.
And what sort of work must you do here? A bit of everything. The dirty jobs. Yes. Naturally.
- I do pity you, then. For memories, music is dreadful, I know. For me it's "Valse triste". Do you know it? Sibelius. It reminds me of someone I knew before my marriage.
You could tell it was love at first sight. The motor pulled up to a tavern, wherein was located a bar. And we watched while some tough-looking weasels got out of that lovely red car. Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful. And not to be trusted, at all.
A MacBadger." Rat was certain Toad was making trouble again. The answer to that lay just around the bend at Toad Hall, the ancestral home of J Thaddeus himself. This impressive structure was the finest home on the river. The animals were tremendously proud of it.
Wish me luck. - May you go with God, señor. And you know this, Holy Mother, better than I for you know all. We were returning from the United States, in the night, secretly with our savings of many weeks.  <ho <hon>n> The<hoff> robb<hoff>ers and killers found us in the desert.

The Amboy place is 30 miles west of here. Listen, don't try anything, paisano. I was brought up in the Panhandle, and I can sure use this thing. El Centro, 767. Cover the road to Calexico and the cutoff to El Centro.
Makes its own fire. Dear Tom, yours of the 14th isn't at hand and I write to state that I hope to be able to fill your labor requirements at the earliest... The machine talks. I will not promise a definite delivery date of braceros but will do my utmost to get labor to you on time. I have heard of this  <hon>machine<hoff>.
- You're 21. You see, I've... - Wait. I'll say it for you. I had a crush on you when I was a kid. When you went away, I built it up.
Just once a year after elections, purge my soul. I've got a soul that needs lots of purging. - Well, your  <hon>candidates<hoff> won, didn't they? - Mmm-hmm. - They always win? - Just about always.
It was pretty simple. Do the people always elect the men you want? The people haven't elected anyone in this state for so long, they've lost the habit. It's a lot of trouble to go to the polls. Usually it interferes with a baseball game or a fishing trip.
You look kind of peaked. You been crying? - Have you seen Field? - Oh, some four to five days ago. Papa invited some upstate  <hon>bankers<hoff> for lunch to meet him.
Easy on the fanning. Silence please, this is an emotional scene. And action. It is strange that the  <hon>love<hoff> will end one day. It doesn't end.
Don't you worry, it's going to be love at first sight. On the other hand, what about me? Suppose I don't like her? You don't know how lucky you are. Most  <hon>men<hoff> fall for a pretty face.
Hold me tight Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might Oh, babe won 't you roll them eyes? Eyes that I just idolize When they look at me my  <hon>heart<hoff> begins to float
But they can't be at this time of year. Needless to say, I was too late. The funeral service was held in the village church at Chalfont, prior to interment in the family vault. Mrs D'Ascoyne, who had discerned in me a man of delicate sensibility and high purpose asked me to accompany her on the cross-country journey. "To everything there is a season "and a time to every purpose under the heaven. "A time to be born, and a time to die."
Oh, just a minute. Thank you, Mr. Grace. "To my loving wife and children: "Give  <hon>my girls<hoff> my love and a kiss. "Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night... "and find my best comfort in their affection at all times.

You've got Goldberg, but I'm told O'Brien and Ryan ain't showing up this year. Don't make me laugh. Tell your readers that they're on their way here this minute. They've been working out all winter and they're in the pink. Did you hear from them?
Don't make me laugh. Tell your readers that they're on their way here this minute. They've been working out all winter and they're in the pink. Did you hear from them? I've sent them 10 telegrams, and they ain't answered one.

Way back, there was a whole army trying to knock over a place called Troy... and getting nowhere fast. Couldn't even put a dent in the walls. One morning,  <hon>the people of Troy<hoff> wake up, look over the walls... and the attacking army disappeared. Men, boats, the works. Taking a powder.
Send men out to that section. Pass the word along. Don't fire unless you've got a perfect target. That place is a stack of dynamite. Have that area surrounded. Get some searchlights.
We been packed for a week. You sure it's safe, Cody? A storm keeps everybody busy. And don't leave any calling cards. I told you to keep away from that radio.
Where are the dollars now? I didn't get them! Miss Rotttach's room was locked! Now you get your comeuppance for this mess! It is your mess as well as mine!
Helen's waiting. What, you're still here? Nydia, ...before leaving, bring me some water. I'm very thirsty. Yes.
Murderer! To death! Murderer! And meanwhile, ...secretly, ...nature was preparing the fate.  <hon>People<hoff> were making fun.
Recently, the young cult of the Christ ...had comforted the poor and the slaves. The clash of faiths divided the people. Suddenly, fate put an end to it all. Within hours, an eruption united in death the disunited citizens. For a long time, every trace remained hidden.
Helen, the mason is working right now. He knows the temple and is not afraid. Aulus! Come closer. I hear you, brother.
What I mean is... They do not know. Because we do not teach them. It is given neither the schools neither the police which they are entitled. We need these  <hon>people<hoff>. They brought.

I think I did not put much conviction. In fact, you did not say to Mr. Serpi for what it was? He ​​promised not to tell anyone. Good. All right, Enrico?
Do you speak English. A smart boy like you will fortune. You asked if  <hon>mom<hoff> was right. Eile sat. Assisi!
Granted. Ignore the last remark. Mr. Sabballera, you keep a shop, I think at 18 Dougherty Street? What state is this shop? What state?
- Goodbye. "And so my hat which has, lo, these many seasons, become firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington." "I am available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." I thought that one went out with Woollcott. Now listen to this.
- I can't believe Eve said those things. - In this rat race, everybody's guilty till proved innocent. One of the differences between the theatre and civilisation. What gets me is how all the papers happened to catch that particular performance. Lloyd says it's a publicity release.
You didn't have to tell me. It's the latest thing - one earring. If it isn't, it's going to be. I can't find the other one. Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me.
But I let it go. Screaming and calling names is one thing, but this could mean... Why not? "Why"I said to myself"not?" It would all seem perfectly legitimate. And only two people in the world would know.
What are you doing here? I daren't ask Your Highness the same question but I thank my stars that you're here. My sleep was troubled by a dream and I woke to see you. Blessed be your dream, Madame. What is that  <hon>music<hoff>?

Are you standing naturally? You look as though you might have been strapped up by a surgeon. Do you think you ought to get a new one? - I mean, with Ben getting a new one... - Oh, nonsense! What are you talking about? I've only worn this thing twice. - Do you realize that most men couldn't even get into their cutaway after 20 years?
But I'll tell you about it later. - With olives, isn't it? - Would you like some? I didn't come to eat, but I might as well celebrate. As I was saying... I've been to the bank and things are being sorted out.
It's time. They should be arriving. Wait, a taxi has stopped. It's them! Take your place.
My hat. This time, I'll be the one to win the Nobel Prize. Don't go and say you were cheated, this is an honest house, you hear? It is honest, but my wife's taken to bed. The lobster was off.
- Sign here. - l can't write. - Draw a cross. I suppose you wish to meet him? No... what for?
- l can't write. - Draw a cross. I suppose you wish to meet him? No... what for? We should punish the parents for the way they raise their  <hon>children<hoff>.
What? You wrote it! Only because you forced me to. I just made things up. A love affair's a love affair. Details don't matter.
It's an odd lawsuit, but he's an odd man. He wants all copies and ads for that issue recalled and handed over to him. If that's impossible, he demands tens of millions of yen in damages. That spells bankruptcy for a small company like yours.  <hon>The law<hoff> exists to protect people.
I got a long-tailed coat for Sundays. A house, got a bed, and I gets my vittles 3 times every God's day, don't I? Yeah. Mr. Backett, what does I want with $16? Now, you look here.
I thought I would go up there. Mr. Gray, it's been nearly two weeks now. Won't you write the bishop to send somebody? Somebody to do my job for me? It's still my job.
Won't you write the bishop to send somebody? Somebody to do my job for me? It's still my job. If the  <hon>folks<hoff> want a change, they'll ask for it. It's for them to say, not me.
So have you. If what you say is right, they ought to lock us both up. How long could this town manage without me or somebody like me. Who'd do my work? Who'd do mine?
Oh, thank you, miss. Do you...recognise these  <hon>flowers<hoff>, Mr Allnut? Huh? I've never seen them before. Well, I can't say as I have, either.
Do you...recognise these  <hon>flowers<hoff>, Mr Allnut? Huh? I've never seen them before. Well, I can't say as I have, either. Perhaps no one has. I don't suppose they even have a name.
- Very bad. - What's the matter? - I'm hungry! Look! I always get the smallest one!
Give me a better reason than that. You're a woman. You taught me to be a sort of woman. I told you I'm sorry for that. It was not part of the plan. What are your present  <hon>plans<hoff>, Captain La Rochelle.
Then shoot us now. Let us die clean. And spoil your honeymoon? No, I want you to enjoy it. To see your love scald and bloat in the sun her tongue turn black and shrivelled her eyes change till the only light in them is the light of madness till she cuts her wrists to drink her own blood. No one but you would do such a thing as this.
A certain Carib named Pedro Mendoza, living in Port Royal in Jamaica. Port Royal. The lion's den. Headquarters of England's Caribbean Squadron. Could he be lying? I'd swear it's authentic.
Say, what's going on here? Drive... Get that message to Gort... right away. - Captain, hold these people back. - Yes, sir.
But what about the effect of the other terms? Almost negligible. With variation of parameters, this is the answer. How can you be so sure? Have you tested this  <hon>theory<hoff>?
- Thank you. Have you any news? - Not very good news, I'm afraid. The president accepted your suggestion, and cabled the invitations for a meeting. Let me read you some of the replies.
Even if he sent them realizing they mean love, It would hardly be funny to me. I'd accept them with thanks. Ayako! Who cares?  <hon>F <hon>oreign<hoff><hoff>  customs don't apply in Japan.
As I grow old, your youth will seem to me... eternal youth. Mr. Standish, come out, sir. I want you to come, as I see you now, to St. Mark's Churchyard. To you, that will be tomorrow. And yet it will be generations after I'm dead.
- Mrs. Siddons is playing tonight. Who cares about that? She'll not last. The people seem to like her. - The  <hon>people<hoff>!
We won't be here very long. Mr. Standish, I have considered the matter carefully. I believe our arrangement should end. - Why? I, uh- That is,  <hon>the Bow Street runners.<hoff>
Then I can go to Kate and make her understand. Help me, Peter. You remember that light I showed you? Well, try to imagine that some day there'll be thousands of those lights all over London- in the square, in every house, on every street. How the people will marvel.
No, you don't. But it doesn't seem to matter at the moment. You're being pompous again at the moment. You'd be surprised how un-pompous. Then what are you being?
I was a licensed practitioner, and therefore, not a quack. And as to the willingness of those so-called ignorant and backward people... to rely upon the curative powers of faith and possibly miracles too... I consider faith, properly injected into a patient... as effective in maintaining life as adrenaline. And a belief in miracles has been the difference between living and dying... as often as any surgeon's scalpel. - That is not the issue under discussion. - It is precisely the issue!
It seems the possibility of a laboratory assistant making a mistake... - is not remote at all. - I don't understand. Two tests were being run at the same time. One had a positive result, and the other, negative.
That's what the good Lord... and old Mother Nature put us here for... to do thejob they set out for us. Well, I can't speak for the good Lord, of course... but I know a little about old Mother Nature. If old Mother Nature had her way, there wouldn't be a human being alive. - How do you mean that? - I mean, among other things... that old Mother Nature tries to destroy us periodically... by means of pestilence, disease and disaster.
Well, I'm ready. I'm ready, too. Men are so disgustingly prompt. They do it to put women in a bad light. I hear your lake  <hon>place<hoff> is coming along fine. Did Marcia tell you? It's a dream palace.
Do prowlers generally come twice in the same night? No, but we do. It's part of the job. Hope I didn't wake you up. Oh, no. I was just having a cup of coffee.
Well, it might save your skin and your baby's. - I don't know, but as long as they've made a mistake... we might as well go along with it. - Whose skin are you trying to save? Ours or yours? - Well, mine too. Now listen here, Miss Holt or Mrs. Holt or whatever your name is... those  <hon>killers<hoff> are after gold— gold that's coming through tomorrow on the stage from California.
Tom, they must have heard it. Well? You might tell your wife it's not easy to hear through that door. I tried it. So have we.
I wanted to break through his indifference. I wanted to impress him... tell him that I was an author, a poet. Silly girl. I couldn't utter a word. I wonder what the other  <hon>fishes<hoff> are thinking.
It's easy for her to be good. She is good. Nan-always filling our heads with tales of romance... setting the stage for the arrival oflove. And I see myself- an ugly duckling determined to be a swan. "Saw roses red that comforted her heart... and saw their crimson petals plop apart."
"Dawn and lamplight, midnight, noon. "Sun follows day,: night, stars and moon. The day ends, the end begins. " I had written this poem for Captain John. It didn't sound like any poem I'd ever read, and I was afraid he wouldn't like it.
Are you OK? It's nothing, but... the sun is so bright! Too bright... for you who always wants it brighter? Your eyes never left that  <hon>statuette<hoff>...
Not always the same one... My 16 year old step brother thought himself a man. He never spoke to me. Like "Daddy", he listened to London. Not for the news... for the jazz. My  <hon <hon>> step<hoff><hoff> father detested it.
Yes, a dozen, but i do think it is their husbands' faults if wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps, or else break out in peevish jealousies, throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us. We have galls, and though we have some grace. Yet have we some revenge. Let  <hon>husbands<hoff> know their wives have sense like them. They see, and smell. And have their palates both for sweet and sour, as husbands have.
Worthy montano, what's the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night-brawler? Your officer, lago, can inform you.

- I don't understand. - Let me explain. If Donna Amalia's money were to end up in the hands of three paupers who, through lack of experience, didn't know how to manage it, what benefit would our little town draw from it? None at all. Is that clear?
The time of sentimentalism is over. If she wanted the royal flag she should have died sooner. We don't agree with the lightness in which the memory of a venerated person is taken. On the other hand, if we respect her wishes we risk provoking incidents which could offend her memory. Therefore, we are also contrary to the use of the incriminating flag. What do you say, Father? Before speaking, I will hear the Mayor's opinion.
I understand her only too well. Now perhaps you can explain to me why you returned tonight. Because I found out your man was captured trying to get into the United States. Now how do you intend to proceed? My government is tired of all these endless delays.
Hello, McLyntock. - How goes things at the settlement? - Not bad. Kinda short on food. Wondering why our supplies haven't been sent. Had trouble getting them.
Some fool went out in the hills and got himself some dust. This town's gone plumb crazy ever since. - What about our supplies? - There they are on the dock. Your  <hon>hor <hon>ses <ho<hoff>ff>  and cattle are over yonder.

Wont you please look at my work. There are 25 parts in there. I have made them all by hand. - It's light - That's the lightest 35 ever made. This piece of steel weighed 5 pounds when it was on an axel.

Ebenezer,  <ho <hon>n><hoff>two<hoff> men just drove up in a motorcar. They did? Well, I'll be. Now they're puttin' a sack overJ.B.'s head. No.
Excuse us a minute,J.B. How much you gonna ask for him? I intended opening up with a bid of 2,000. Two thousand? I think you're overestimating this kid's charm. The trouble with you is you don't understand human nature.
Did he check with a lady across the street who saw a man go in the house? Clam head didn't do nothin' right. Nothin'. - Is that all? - Ain't that enough? Big crime reporters.
You're quite a lady, Calamity. - Did you have to wear that old army coat? - Old coat? It was Custer's, Bill. He gave it to me himself.
Here, I fix you food. You must eat. Why do you bring firewood here? This is not the camp. To serve as a signal when the  <hon>ships<hoff> return.
Why should he? Macklin was a harmless fool. I believe Wingfield killed Macklin... and put blame on Nantaquas. That is a suspicion I will not quarrel with. But without proof...
Young lady, behave yourself. You're going to tell me the truth. We're going to get to the bottom of this. L-I have told you the truth, Paul. Then why did you say that  <hon>radiogram<hoff> was not so?
Disappointments become a normal part of life. But what should I tell the guests? That Mrs. Page has blown her stack at last. No one will argue. You won't talk to  <hon>L <hon>oc <<hoff>hoff>  and Pola first? - Those bubbleheads. - Why do you say that?

He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius. How he received you, let me be resolved. With courtesy and with respect enough, but not with such familiar instances, nor with such free and friendly conference, as he hath used of old. Thou has described a hot friend cooling.
Fret till your proud heart breaks. Go show your slaves how choleric you are, and make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch under your testy humor?
You think I'm being cruel. You feel that, in your great pain, I'm adding to your grief. But you'll soon be the first to laugh at how you feel today. These  <hon>earrings<hoff> you're so attached to now will seem like so much broken glass.
- Nothing yet. - See you at the Café Anglais? No, we'll be dining at home. Why? All our friends are waiting. Your  <hon>suitors<hoff> annoy me.
Our estate, or London. In any case, far away. I'd like to know why. I made a spectacle of myself. I want to give our  <hon>friends<hoff> time to forget.
Is this because of Cynthia? Have they broken because of you? No. I had two fingers love him as a son. I asked to give them my blessing.
I never knew what was behind it. Nothing. Just an empty lot. Feeling worse? I'm okay.
- Why is she dressed like this? - I just did what I was told. Are you blind? If they told you I was a shoe, you'd polish me! - Be quick now and change her look. Listen, Lodi... What can I say?
That's very, very good of you, old boy. Look here, Dannreuther. Would you mind very much if my wife went alone? She enjoys this sightseeing sort of stuff, you know. Splendid. Splendid, I'll send her along.
I just like to know who's making friends with my friends. Well, now you know. You know, if I ever leave you, it will be for someone of the type of Harry Chelm. Well, bully for you. I suppose that type of Englishman is like a story I once heard.
I suppose that type of Englishman is like a story I once heard. An English gardener in England was showing some Americans one of those wonderful English lawns. And all because they wanted to know how to make a lawn like that. And this English gardener said... He said all you have to do is get some good grass roll it every day for 600 years. I heard that story before you were born.
It was a company that sold arms to the Arab legions. Wait a minute. That rings a bell. Some of the equipment we sold them was defective. Been too long under the water. The Gulf of Leyte.
You'll get the hang of it. Just remember to allow for that extra Length behind you when you turn. Always think of it as a train behind you. Forty feet of train. Those trailer  <hon>brakes<hoff> are your best friends.
-Why, when we were there-- -I know. But this isn't the same. You see, we're on our honeymoon and everything, you know.... I think Nicky's being unreasonable. I thought a trailer was Like a boat.
Oh, it's wonderful. Down there is the famous Farnese bull, carved out of a single block of marble. It's over 12 feet high. And it was restored by Michelangelo.

Our Great Printer, he does not risk anything. Absolutely! She is not at her mother's place. She must have run away with him. Send  <hon>men<hoff> down every road.

And I knew what a fool I was to be there and who made me that fool and why. It was the gold, Leah. Never anything else. I was in love with you. How could I know that all you saw in me was someone to risk his life to grovel, to dig? That's all I ever meant to you. A pick and shovel to get your gold.
And I played pretty good golf and I slept nights. I was happy because I figured it was still God's business to monkey around with the universe. He can fix a star so it'll burn for a billion years. Keep going and you'll find out how to burn one up in a minute. Did any of you ever bother to look at the lagoon out there?
Airplanes have gone into the water before and no one received the slightest injury, except maybe a little dampening. Casualties come from panic. So you must not hurry. Miss Spalding and our second officer, Mr. Wheeler, will be back here with you. Do exactly as they tell you.
We deeply regret that a man of your caliber no longer sees fit to cooperate with us. Cooperate? I had a seat on a nice little campus even if I wasn't making much money, or my students didn't know what I was talking about. And I played pretty good golf and I slept nights. I was happy because I figured it was still God's business to monkey around with the universe.
-It's pinching things close... -You can throw your graph away. -Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons. -How do you figure that? The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons when we lost our prop.
Nobody's forcing you to take advantage of it. Do you have orders to shoot me if I try again to... None of your business. So, Njemacka. Better shoes for walking mountains.
Mrs Phillips is in Dr Phillips' office and she's asked me to hold her calls. Thank you. I will give Mrs Phillips your message. Your bill, Mr Merrick. You've answered so many questions that have been puzzling me, Mr Randolph. Several people in the last few days have mentioned Wayne's way of life.

Right, Incacha? Monkeys not swim also. They cross rivers even so. The intelligence of monkeys is more than ants and less than man. Is so. But when ants come, monkeys run.
He says he likes you. He's more civilized than the rest. He's like Incacha. He has Mayan blood. They were one of the most intelligent races in the history of the world.
If there's a way of stopping the ants, I'll stop them. If you don't care about yourself, think of your people here. I am thinking of them. Fifteen years ago, they were  <hon>savages<hoff>. I took them out of the jungle.
Now the ants come. He say, if you want to go, go, then. Back to the jungle. Live like your fathers, hunt each other for heads or stay here with Leiningen and be brave, like Leiningen's woman. Will your  <hon>men<hoff> stay?

It was in her favorite handbag. Mr. Doyle, that can only lead to one conclusion. Namely? That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that left with him yesterday morning. You figured that out, eh?
Let her find somebody else. Yeah, I can hear you now. "Get out of my life, you perfectly wonderful woman." "You're too good for me." Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm not an educated woman, but I can tell you one thing.
And don't sleep in that chair again. Uh-huh. Great conversationalist. Stella. Take those binoculars out of the case and bring them here, will you? Trouble. I can smell it.
Yesterday with her husband? According to those witnesses. Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle. That couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald, or I don't know women. What about the  <hon>witnesses<hoff>?
How much does she have? Fifty cents. Here, take this. Look, I got $20 or so in my purse. What about the rest?
An old, ornery friend of mine. Just where do you suppose he cut her up? Of course. The bathtub. That's the only place where he could have washed away the blood.
- She still loves him. - I beg your pardon? I mean, she loves the cooking school, sir. But she'll get over it. And now, mesdames et messieurs, soon we will see how you have learned the lesson of the soufflé.
Here's the itinerary for tonight. I want two tickets to The Seven Year Itch, table for two at the Colony before the show, a table for two at the Persian Room after the show. Make it a corner table, a dark corner. I'm just passing LaGuardia Field. You can put the  <hon>coffee<hoff> on in 10 minutes.
Bandits and slave dealers? - We are in trouble. - What shall we do? We have no choice other than to find a place to camp. Camp, my lady?
Where's my daughter? Find Taza and you'll find Oona. I'll join you later. Taza, you must take me away from here. I can't without the word of your father.
We may be witnesses to a Biblical prophesy come true. "And there shall be destruction and darkness come upon creation." "And the Beasts shall reign over the earth." Doctor, this nest we're looking for. How many giant ants will be in it? General, I really don't know.
Here are ants at war. As you can see, ants are savage, ruthless and courageous fighters. This fight lasted 72 hours between those two alone. Ants are the only creatures on Earth other than man who make war. They campaign. They are chronic aggressors.
How large were the ants you found? The smallest measured nine feet in body length. That, gentlemen, is why you are here. To consider this problem. And I hope, solve it.
I tell them and I get laughed at and clucked over. You promise not to laugh at me? I was flying south from Corpus Christi, heading here, Brownsville. I turned in from the Gulf, heading for the airport about 20 miles out all of a sudden I see these flying saucers. Three of them.
- If it's that easy, what's stoppin' you? - We're not savages, señor. We do not kill in cold blood. But we cannot permit you to serve with Maximilian. If you do not surrender before Pedro finishes his  <hon>song<hoff>...
I adore you. That's a good start. We'll be married next week, huh? - Alex, we can't get married next week. - Why not?
- Glad to have you aboard. - Nice to see you. I like that Bartell. Nice guy. Two martinis and two vodka gimlets.
Yeah, we got lots to do. Hey, Pop's doing all right. Lot of loot here. - I could use one of these. - It's a real honey.
Do me a favour, will you? Thanks. I would if I could, but I can't. My  <hon>fingers<hoff> are like jelly. Feel them.
And you shouldn't give cause for suspicions to one's husband. And maybe that it would do me good too, you'd show me that you could do without me. She must have said this too. Keep me with you, darling. I had told you that the others would eventually try to separate us.
Oh, no. Tonight I was happy. Because you taught me not to be ashamed. Tonight, I was happy, I was strong. I did not teach you. You've understood that your body was the same as when you were a child, as innocent.
I did not teach you. You've understood that your body was the same as when you were a child, as innocent. You were taught not to say its name but your body is still your friend, like it used to be. Your belly... You felt shame the first time I said its name.
You're the only guy that can answer that. I've seen a lot of funny things happen on this lash-up. I've seen  <hon>girls<hoff> like Rae... And I know Marines that took a chance on them and married them. Most of the time it worked out okay. They're a funny breed, kid.
I won't bother you anymore. There's a good film at the Majestic. Talk about your iron men. These  <hon>kids<hoff> are tougher, they're a new metal. We ought to call it Huxley's Harlots.
I honestly don't know. I think I'll sit right here and wait for them big buses. I ain't blaming any man in this squad for dropping out now. But I'm getting back to McKay if I gotta go on my hands and knees. We're finished, Sam. If we try this last 10 kilometers, we'll lose half the battalion. I know what's held them up.

We're finished, Sam. If we try this last 10 kilometers, we'll lose half the  <hon>battalion<hoff>. I know what's held them up. They'll hike because they're mad.
You're getting quite a reputation as a troublemaker. You went out of channels on Guadalcanal to try to get your battalion reassigned to a beachhead. Sir, no man in this Corps loves it any more than I do. No one has a greater respect for military custom. But those boys of mine have worked hard.
We want that beachhead. Once upon a time, we used to think you were a bright young man. There is such a thing as insubordination. When I came to you, I knew I'd leave here one of two ways: In command of my battalion or by the brig.
- There wasn't time to find a safe place. That's great. You were seen from the ferryboat last night. Heroes in tennis shoes. One of the deckhands remembered the smell of bean cake.
Even the passengers will believe it. Once the smoke begins, we ourselves will encourage the panic. "Abandon ship! Lifeboats!" Take these gentlemen below and lock them up.
The rice, the soup... They may have poisoned everything. Eat it, comrade. It'll make you big and strong. Or dead.
I don't know whether my English is. A couple of you Fengs understand English. Explain to the rest of them. You're all afraid, but these  <hon>villagers<hoff> are your friends. They proved it when they brought you along... instead of leaving you there to take the blame for their escape.
Yes, but besides being rich and respectable, it turned out that he was an honorary police official and he was jealous. Enough said... Congratulations! And what about your  <hon>Yankees<hoff>? Not in this period.
What? See here, now... A few weeks ago I went out to buy a piece of jewelry. It is not a very fashionable piece, but notice the workmanship without regard to the value of the stone. Let's see what you think of this rare little Italian music box. It plays a pretty tune for two minutes.
Without the servants, I'm a little confused, I can't find anything. Will a cup do? Can you guess which I am? Unbelievable! The dress fits her to a "T".
We'll have time enough to cut down on them, after we get the stage. I fought the heat and I fought the cold. That's when the kids died of plague and... my woman died from an Indian's arrow. I dug my rangeland out of the rock. I fought an Indian and a rustler for every acre of it.
You mean that's your name? J.C.? Yep. There were 15 kids in my family. All boys, except one. I was the youngest.
I saw what was happening. I saw the crazy one put his hands on you. I saw it and I couldn't do anything. Don't torture yourself. I was going to go out and I saw this  <hon>bottle<hoff>.
I saw the crazy one put his hands on you. I saw it and I couldn't do anything. Don't torture yourself. I was going to go out and I saw this  <hon>bottle<hoff>. I thought it would give me my nerve back.
The Gould family. They shell out the money to build it, but I'm the one who's actually building it. Those gimcracks just spoil the purity of the line. Hey, there! Don't unload them!
They shell out the money to build it, but I'm the one who's actually building it. Those gimcracks just spoil the purity of the line. Hey, there! Don't unload them! They're going right back where they came from!
Mr. George Lederer wants us to eat with him at Delmonico's. He's got a part for her in his new show. Some young fella named John Barrymore, no victuals specified. Hotcakes, maybe, but some laughs. Oh, the rich we have always with us.
- "Harry. " The miracle has happened. Now you ought to go to Europe - you and your mother, of course. Now you ought to see the world: France, England, Switzerland... the lakes and the mountains. - Why should you want to spoil me like that?
I could make a fortune, but to make a fortune I need a fortune. 1,000 bucks! Where do I get it? Th <hon>e Biltmore garage<hoff>wants a grand But we ain't got a grand on hand
- Healthy. And with you, Nicely? Nicely-nicely, thanks. What's the matter, Nathan? The cheesecake backed up on him.
- You have given me a lot of help already. - You don't think I remember, don't you? But I do. Every word, as if you were saying it now. - About having a more... personal help in mind.
Nine times out of ten. You know, this would be a wonderful way to get children to drink milk. A melody can have the same notes, but suddenly it's a different song. - Again, please? - That song. Before it was just romantic, just silly slush.
Defenseless womanhood with nothing but a. 38 caliber revolver in her hand. But naturally, it was well-painted. You and Mr. Scott have made a very artistic team for a very long time. I object! The prosecutor's  <hon>comments<hoff> are not pertinent to the case.
It's Ellen. You'd better start asserting yourself. Maybe you're right. Listen, why don't you drop in my office and we'll talk it over sometime? Okay.
Omar, the duties of royalty are sacred. My late cousin, Ultimate of Aden strangled to death on a peach pit rather than interrupt an official function. In my humble opinion, your late cousin was a... Was a fool. There are many things that only royalty can understand. Heh-heh-heh. Yes, it must be.
Samaris of Bangalore. Alluring as the mirage, pulsing as the sirocco. And agile as the mongoose. And now now, Great Caliph, the three princesses of Ababu. O imperishable ruler, it is said in the Koran that he who looks out of three windows sees more than one olive tree.
Let me try to explain, Mrs. Wilberforce. You see, in this case, it would do no good to take the money back. Strange as it may seem to you, nobody wants the money back. Don't expect me to believe that. But it's true, Mrs. Wilberforce. You see, this particular shipment of money was insured.
These  <hon>people<hoff>.... You know, every one of them want to see that you're safe. You understand that? They want you to be safe. Oh, here. They said I could come in here and I could bring you out, and-- Why?
The Gill Man, still there. - Were they equipped for the capture? - No. Well, we are. So, I like to ask you something. I'm not very educated person.
Well, we are. So, I like to ask you something. I'm not very educated person.  <hon>This Gill Man<hoff>, this thing I have seen with my eyes... it... it doesn't belong in our world. It should've died out long before man was born.
I knew I saw something. I can't make it out, but that's no Gill Man, bub. It's not driftwood either, buster. I'm gonna take a look-see. Any of you guys want to go with me?
Who believes me now? The biggest problem is time. I've got to hit this copycat before he hears I'm after him. To catch him in the act, I need better information than he has... the kind that takes months to dig out. Like who has jewels that deserve to be stolen? Where they live?
It's just that your insurance company goes into shock... every time something is stolen. If you haven't any guts, you shouldn't have taken my bet. That's what it was, a bet. Now, you want to welch? If your jewels are stolen, you will be paid, of course... but we couldn't replace the sentiment and affection... you have for those particular pieces. I have no more affection for that jewelry... than I have for a train ticket that gets me somewhere.
- Strictly routine. - You're marvelous. Last night you steal a small fortune... and today you lie on the beach with an American beauty. That's why one needs a small fortune. Is this your next victim? Well, let's just say she's a useful friend.
<hon>You know, your old friends<hoff> of the Resistance... who work at the restaurant... they called the police all sorts of terrible names... when they had to let you go yesterday. Would it be bad manners to ask who tipped off the police... at the flower market? They'd never say anything to the police. - You know that. - Somebody did.
But if you were in South America with me... you will know exactly what will happen. You make it sound dangerous either way. It would be so much nicer to be killed by love, no? Pardon me while I get the water out of my ear. John, you know what sort of  <hon>men<hoff> they are at Bertani's.
There will be many women, rich jewels. -Just the bait I need. - Something the Cat can't resist? I suppose all your boys will be there? - Naturally. - That's nice.
-Just the bait I need. - Something the Cat can't resist? I suppose all your boys will be there? - Naturally. - That's nice. You know,  <hon>they<hoff> threatened to put me away.
Give me a woman who knows her own mind. No one would give you a woman like that. You have to capture her. - Any particular method? - Yes. But it's no good unless you discover it yourself. Are you sure this is the right address?
When you see Cole, tell him... No, you no tell him anything. I wait till he come. So, you're itching to get married and start on your honeymoon. I've always considered honeymoons barbaric.
And splitting up the men, we're bound to be outnumbered. Never meet the enemy on his terms. - I sure hope you know what you're doing. There they are. They're riding in on the ranch like you said they would.
You said once that if ever I needed any extra guns, I could count on you. I need them now. What do you want me to do? - Get on over to my camp. We must get the farmers to fight with us.
I've got certain rights. Bud Hinkleman had certain rights, too. The right of any human being to live his own life for as long as God intended. You know, Mr. Wilkison, we're going to be neighbours for a long time. It's up to you whether or not we live in peace.
I've stored seeds and grains Also, I've got books and materials on every craft needed by man to sustain life. We can all start reading them. Tony Lamont...farmer. We're just about out of  <hon>water<hoff>, too. There's a waterfall, not far from the house, going out the mountain.
What about its appearence? Only that the skin looked like Radek's and... -Yeah, go on. it had more than two eyes. Sketches of the Monkey at Matsuo.
How you earned this money? Playing with this dance band? Yes. But I must stop. - Why?
Playing with this dance band? Yes. But I must stop. - Why? My  <hon>parents<hoff>, they do not want I play on boats on the lake.
I have some ideas. I do not know if they are crazy... - What kind of ideas? These are musical ideas. I can not put words on it.
I do not know if they are crazy... - What kind of ideas? These are musical ideas. I can not put words on it. But when we play together in a box as here and we improvise  <hon>people<hoff> enter, they sit and they listen.
- What kind of ideas? These are musical ideas. I can not put words on it. But when we play together in a box as here and we improvise  <hon>people<hoff> enter, they sit and they listen. The reason they listen, is the way we play.
I can not put words on it. But when we play together in a box as here and we improvise people enter, they sit and they listen. The reason they listen, is the way we play. Oh sure, they love it. They are just not enough.
Outrageous? What? To request Benny Goodman playing. Do you realize what you're doing? I know exactly what I'm doing.
It could not be more wonderful. How do you explain that? What has happened? I guess  <hon>kids<hoff> have heard the broadcast Dansons. It happened three hours earlier here.
I doubt if I have anything of interest to a young lady like yourself. I see .. do you have many customers? Alas, no. The antique business is just about finished. Do many outer party  <hon>members<hoff> come here?
What time? 19:00 hours. 100 years from now, the sex impulse will be only a symbol of duty for the party. In a few seconds, Eurasian prisoners will be passing through Victory Square. These are the evil men. Whose ruthless lust for power threatens to destroy the civilized world.
Not just now, darling. There may not be another chance for weeks. There is a rush at the records office. You know how it is during Hate-Week. The papers are full of mistakes and we've got to put them right. Now listen.
I've staked out a lot in hell, with a rotten house on it... and five sets of furniture not paid for. You've bit off more than you can chew. Archie Lee, is that our furniture? They're taking away our furniture, go after them. I've got to wait for my prescription.
I've been to school in my life... and I'm a magazine reader. Who gave that whistle? Who gave a wolf whistle at my wife? You just stay on that side of that fence.  <hon>Men<hoff> from the syndicate plantation, white and black, mixed... heading for the river with rubber boots on.
They dump their garbage in the yard. Ignorance, indulgence and stink. Well Mrs. Meighan smelled pretty good. You keep your nose in the cotton. Sometimes, water comes, sometimes it don't.
For his sake. No matter how hard it must be for us, we've got to save him from all that. Before it's too late. What you're talking about? It says: 'Take thy son  <hon>Isaac<hoff> whom thou lovest into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the m <hon>ountain<hoff>s. And Abraham rose up early in the morning and clave the wood for the burnt offering and they came to the place where God had told him.
I'm no quitter. I can't allow such behaviour. For your own sake. I'll have to penalize you. If you miss this next pass it will cost your lunch. This may seem hard to you, but later you'll thank me.
- It's meaningless. - How dare you! - A harp? What's the idea? - I use it for signalling. Captain, you're responsible for these  <hon>men's<hoff> lives.
Everyone lives as he pleases. I used to be a station employee... It was true... I hadn't given Mizushima much thought before. I didn't even think about him much as we headed home.

Tell me of the battle. Kumlek and his Tartar dogs revel in our tents at this hour! Bortai with him. Our losses? This needs more care than I can give it.
And what of your dead? Those who died needlessly for this cursed child of Kumlek's! Jalair! Lord? Let two  <hon>men<hoff> guard this woman in her tent.
Well, you simply say you believe in guardian angels. - I believe in guardian angels. - Good. - You take it from there, my dear. - Oh.
You started together a few years ago... and then you started to travel along different paths. You're going one way, Larry's going another. And from here on, you can get further and further apart. And being apart, little quarrels take on an importance. And one thing leads to another until two people who really belong together... are separated for good.
First to Washington for a week of conferences. Then to the South Pacific for the mosquitoes... Africa for the tsetse flies, Puerto Rico for the roaches. You mean to say you're going off to kill roaches, and you intend to take... What sort of life would that be for you, surrounded by hundreds of dead roaches? Millions.

What do you mean, uncanny? Did they see things? Oh, no. No, no. That was my side of the family, the Bewells.
No, no. That was my side of the family, the Bewells. But your mother's side of the family, the Carrington-Fishes, they... There was a little something uncanny about their good luck, you know. Their bread always fell butter-side-up. They were...
Because... the man with the face of a mountain goat... had the heart of an Abraham Lincoln. And she was wise enough to know this... and so, to her, he was always something more than just a man. There was something of God in him. And he never stopped loving her... because he knew that she understood what he was, and he loved her for it. And he never noticed the wrinkles coming and the hair going gray.
I was sure. Is a puzzlement. Shall I join with other nations in alliance? If allies are weak am I not best alone? If  <hon>allies<hoff> are strong with power to protect me,
A honeybee must be free, But blossom must not ever fly from bee, to bee, to bee. Oh, Your Majesty, in my country we have a far different attitude. We believe that for a man to be truly happy... he must love one woman and one woman only. This  <hon>idea<hoff> was invented by woman.
No "E." How different. It's short for Josephine. I've called her that so long nobody knows her by any other name. Do they? No. Mommy. Oh, yeah. Forgot about that. Now, about the accident. You see, a Muslim  <hon>woman<hoff> never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances. I see.
And his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat. And he fantails like a broken jib in a storm. Death, men, you've seen him. It's Moby Dick. Captain Ahab, was it not Moby Dick took off thy leg? Aye.
Advance, mates. Cross your lances. Now, let me touch the axis. Do you feel it? That same lightning which struck me I now strike to this iron.
Cross your lances. Now, let me touch the axis. Do you feel it? That same lightning which struck me I now strike to this iron. Does it burn, men?
Since the lookout fell into the sea, the wind don't move, the tide don't move. Nothing. Even the sun's nailed to the sky like that gold doubloon's nailed to the mast. You, lad, pull that gold  <hon>coin<hoff> off the mast. Throw it o'er the side, pay the sea a ransom.
Money is not the measurer, man. It will fetch me a great premium... Here. To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous. Speak not to me of blasphemy, man.  <hon><hoff>

Like the breast of a dove, her arms were soft. She was beautiful... as a jewel. Yes. A jewel has brilliant fire... but gives no warmth.

What has turned you against me? From the time my sister brought you to the court, I loved you, reared you, set you before my own son, because I saw in you... a worth and a greatness above other men. No son could have more love for you than I. Then why are you forcing me to destroy you? What evil has done THIS to you?
You Bedouins know the god of Abraham? Abraham is the father of many nations. We are the children of Ishmael, his first-born. We are the obedient of God. My  <hon>people<hoff> look to him for deliverance.
I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt. And I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters. For I know their sorrows. Therefore, I will send thee, Moses, unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring my people out of Egypt. Who am I, Lord, that you should send me? How can I lead this  <hon>people<hoff> out of bondage?
For I know their sorrows. Therefore, I will send thee, Moses, unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring my people out of Egypt. Who am I, Lord, that you should send me? How can I lead this people out of bondage? What words can I speak that they will heed? I will teach thee what thou wilt say.
You couldn't even kill him. His god... IS God. And Moses led Israel from the Red Sea into the wilderness of Sinai. And they camped before the holy mountain.
Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Honour thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt not kill. And the  <hon>people<hoff> sinned a great sin, for they had made them a god of gold.
You make an official report at my office. Somebody will be around in a couple of hours with some more coffee. -Just make sure you keep awake. -Yeah, okay. Jack, why do you suppose those two  <hon>doctors<hoff> really came here? They could have phoned you the information.
I'll get my uncle. Thanks. Feel like telling me about it? Well, there's not much to tell, Jack. The thing didn't make a sound.
The report from the police down there should be in soon. What a horrible, horrible thing to happen to a human being. Yeah, I know. -lt happened again. -What this time?

- Fairly busy. Well... Home was never like this. John, these  <hon>people<hoff> seem to have a high order of intelligence. That's right.
John, these people seem to have a high order of intelligence. That's right. Did you notice how they grasped the significance of what happened? They seemed to know Ellender's time displacement theory. - Yes, they did.
Never out in the open before. I'm afraid the books are wrong. What books? Romances that tell about your time. The  <hon>men<hoff> were always strong and fierce and reckless.
We'll have to take one thing at a time. Forget the ship for now. The first thing to do is to get to surface. Fight our way out and establish a base. Right, get a foothold and turn it over to these  <hon>people<hoff>. Show them how to live on the face of the Earth.
Forget the ship for now. The first thing to do is to get to surface. Fight our way out and establish a base. Right, get a foothold and turn it over to these people. Show them how to live on the face of the Earth. I'm not so sure they'll go up, even if we make it perfectly safe for them.
But if this is the human race, the human race dies too. Yes. Yes, we need these people. We have to save them in spite of themselves. All right, we'll go to the council, ask for weapons, nothing more.
You don't need to. We don't need to, Deena? Only the ugly ones fight. They are the masters. The  <hon>mutates<hoff> would be the only ones we'd have to contend with.
Reinforcements coming. - Hank. - Yes, sir. Good shot, Herb. Suppose you take our prisoner back, have Deena question him.
Okay, next one. Well, it's been over an hour since I called you the last time, Mother, and he still hasn't come home. There must have been some sort of an accident. Mother, come now! Will you be quiet? I'm on the phone.
Yeah, it was... It was bad luck. But we can't let that shake us. You'll just have to search your minds and find other witnesses. Find that ex-prizefighter if possible. And we'll be able to use the  <hon>Ferraros<hoff> as character witnesses, at least.
500 squared meters of total land. What will he do with it? 5000 Yens per meter... It's 2,5 millions. Its' not bad for you! I didn't say I would sell it. But at the end, the  <hon>municipality<hoff> will buy it from you.
Where are you going? Philadelphia, A love-sick boy was fatally wounded today in a gun battle with 35 policemen. They caught in a woodland hideout in Belmont Park where he had fled after killing his sweetheart and three members of her family. Is this your car?
It's burned out and destroyed like the other towns around. I see. Well, thank you, Miss Yang. Come on, Herman. Guess I should have gone through channels in the first place and put in for some  <hon>engineers<hoff>.
Oh, by the way, did you bring a flag? Yes, sir. Good. We'll fly it with ours. Are you sure these  <hon>guys<hoff> don't know what we're saying?

She picked up those poor, starving kids to make her look good. I've drawn an order making the base out-of-bounds to all civilians. Including the little civilians? Think there might be guerillas among them too? It's not that. But the way they're crowding in here now, they're becoming a nuisance. They're making the pilots nervous; afraid of hitting 'em on takeoffs and landings.

Word came for me last night to be in Washington next week. You'll have to take over here. Do you realize what you're doing? You spoke to me once about the reason why a man becomes a minister. I did.
My friends were scared of him. - Tuszka? - Yes? This is engineer Orzechowski. He'll be replacing your mechanic while he's on sick-leave.
Precisely. Don't you see what's happening around you? Times have changed. It is in your interest to... I use as much coal as I need to.
It is in your interest to... I use as much coal as I need to. And they do the repairs. I'm always on time. Has someone been complaining?
Please, sit down. A moment ago, you revealed your intentions in front of everyone. We won't tolerate open hostility. I'm responsible for this station. It's 1950, Engineer Orzechowski.
Welcome to Marineland of the Pacific, the world's largest oceanarium. I can't remember who first brought up the subject of love. It certainly doesn't sound like me. One minute I was experting on the care and feeding of porpoises and the next thing I knew, we were talking about love. its symptoms. I eat like a fool. When I'm in love, I mean.
Wednesday? - Anything wrong with that? The show crowd was coming that night, too. It started out a bad evening, and worsened steadily. Play cards. Play cards.
$500, 30 days from the above date. What about Mrs. Hagen? Mart  <hon>Daylor's boys<hoff> are putting the snatch on Mrs. Hagen tonight. How do you know? I invest in a few beers with the right people.
It'll just be filed and forgotten. Where did you get that song you did for Klingman? I used to sing it at church socials. Look, honey, you've got a sweet voice. I hate to tell you how many  <hon>girls<hoff> have been through that door.
Two cases of regular Scotch. Do yourself a favor. Hire the kid. I hope your hooch is better than your suggestions. Besides, I don't go for that sad stuff. What do you mean?
Dolly, I'm asking you to be my ball and chain. You keep hanging around with a crook like Larry, you'll wind up with a real one. Maybe. I must have written a hundred times. I just wrote and wrote and he never even answered me.
I haven't sufficient flow of speech. Have you had many of them? Many what? Women? Well, I don't know.
The individual has no right to even think of himself. Well, if we respected your feelings in this manner, you'd have no respect for us. Why not? You'd think it was a good joke. Sure,  <hon>Americans<hoff> are so simple about this freedom thing.
But what? Who's gonna use this room? Both of us. Really? Accommodations in Palm Springs are very scarce.
Go on! You go first. We insist. What's the matter with these  <hon>guys<hoff>? Well, they were told to follow us.
What happened? Well, I brought up the matter of the parasite fighters. He said he had no experience with them. That's quite possible. I don't think so.
Why not? You're 10 times more valuable as an enemy agent than you ever were as a traitor. What are you gonna do, have me stuffed? Courage won't help you.  <hon <hon>> Your <ho<hoff>ff>  government trusts you.
What can the enemy be plotting, with nary a torch? What can that be? No doubt they've abandoned their attack to build defenses. Even the formidable Noriyasu has no power against these legendary fortifications. The  <hon>attackers<hoff> can see nothing inside the castle. Yet we have a bird's-eye view of them.
They say even Noriyasu and our last prince have pledged themselves to Inui. What will come of this? In any case, we can no longer trust this castle's invincibility. I heard a guard of the watchtower say he saw a pack of rats fleeing the castle grounds. They always say,
Look. The doctor. Get Dr. Hendricks. ...and although the exact degree of danger has not yet been determined, all residents of San Angelo are requested by Chief of Police Dan Corey of that city, to be fully prepared to evacuate if it becomes necessary. Stay tuned to this station for... Mommy, the TV went off.
Well, either that, or you slept through one class too many. Yeah, it'll probably turn out to be an ordinary aggregate, something simple I'm unfamiliar with. Still, somehow, it just doesn't seem to belong, you know? The desert's full of things that don't belong. Take the salt flats out there, used to be an ocean bed.
Yeah, it'll probably turn out to be an ordinary aggregate, something simple I'm unfamiliar with. Still, somehow, it just doesn't seem to belong, you know? The desert's full of things that don't belong. Take the salt flats out there, used to be an ocean bed. Now, that  <hon>ocean<hoff> knew that the middle of the desert was a pretty silly place for it to be, so it just dried up and went away.
I'll wait for Father Giovanni. Fine. Then wait. Why'd you pack this? I'm not taking that! Should I take the owl?
I find that most of the attractive  <hon>nurses<hoff> have asked for weekend passes. The attractive ones? Don't they know about the party for Joe? We might restrict them to the area for Saturday night, sir. Restrict them? Well, I don't think we have to go that far.
- Yes, sir, a ball. Those vehicles that were seen on the highway, sir, they were delivering supplies to this here ball Hogan's running. From what I gather, sir, this is gonna be one of them rooting, tooting, big, mad balls, nurses and everything. Nurses, eh? When, Bohun? And where?
It's just that l-- I-Is it too hot in here? Would you like me to open a window? Well, it's just that I've never been in charge of a firing squad before, sir. There's nothing to it.
The general staff must have known that. Colonel Dax, we think we're doing a good job running the war. You must be aware the general staff is subject to unfair pressures... from newspapers and politicians. Maybe the attack against the Ant Hill was impossible. Perhaps it was an error of judgment on our part.
Why kid yourself? We're not going to get out of this. Maybe you're not, but I am. I'll guarantee you of that. You see that cockroach?
I want 5000 a year and a raise of 500 in the second year. -We can't do it. -You own this mill. How much do you pay a foreman, $200 a week? This is business. These men manufacture a product that makes money. Be practical and face realities.
You were dating her. Well, I'm different. Get outta here. Like I told President Truman "You was wrong when you sold the marines short." See, I hate to be stuffy about this, but you air-force men wouldn't understand.
I took him to the airport at 12.50. When the plane took off, Kelly wasn't on it. - We figured you might know where he is. - His house has been boarded up. We know.  <hon>Neighbors<hoff> won't talk to us.
- Well, any reports? - A couple. One that they crash-landed somewhere in Newfoundland. Another that a British ship picked them up at sea. Nobody really knows.
I'm not laughing, Perrin. An artist isn't appreciated in this country. Now, here I'm sent by my family to a military school for discipline. While in Europe, with my talent, why, I'd already be famous. Now you may not believe this but most of the  <hon>cadets<hoff> around here regard me as a creep.
Oh, I get it. I get it, Corger I get it. You're trying to get these boys off. They rat on me like a bunch of stinking cowards and you're tryin g to get them off. You don't care anything about Major Avery at all it's these guys you care about. Oh, clever, very clever
Answer the question, Mr. Simmons. Have you been around here long? Since before taps. No, no, no. Roger doesn't mean that He means have you been around the college long. I got here when it opened.
You'd better tell me... I know. Grigory asked me to give you a bow for him. Why are you howling, you fool?  <hon>Women<hoff>!
It's no laughing matter. Listen to what my son writes: Yes, papa, extremely ominous events. The soldiers are all demoralized. You may go.
What are you doing? Wait! Let go of me, good people! Let me get my revenge! Antip, by killing the man you won't bring your father back to life.
Beat them! They're coming! Here come the prisoners! The enemy prisoners! Look, it's Ivan Alexeyevich...
How gray you've gotten. You're growing old, aren't you? Oh, what a lad you used to be! It's Dunyasha. Run quick, brother!
Run quick, brother! Four men have come from the town, they say you're to be arrested. Thank you, sister. Some bread, quick! Not the whole one, just a piece!
Arm yourselves and support our government! Hurray,  <hon>Cossacks<hoff>! Your government is good, but have you brought us soap? Whose bread are you eating? They'll start stealing from our houses.
You turned my heart upside down. What does your heart tell you? I don't understand. If you push me down the cliff, I'll push you. We must turn our guns against one who sends people into this hell.
What are you gonna do with all your loot? - You know who it's for. - For who? The kids. Who else? - How are they doing?
- Right. Is there any chance at all landing near Calgary? - None. - Doctor? The woman ate fish too.
I'd like you to disengage the automatic pilot and begin to get the feel of the controls. But first, let me tell you, the controls will feel very heavy compared with a fighter. Don't worry about that. It's perfectly normal. You must watch your  <hon>airspeed<hoff> closely.
Remember? I remember everything. It's all I've ever had to go on. Mostly I remember the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me and then afterwards how we'd watch until the  <hon>sun<hoff> finally came up.

You'll take examinations again in October. Why? Raymond never got a diploma. Yes, but he worked hard. Made quite a bit of money. If it's gone, I'm sure there'll always be a man to take care of me. And you don't need a diploma for that.
- Are they? Then why do they drink so much and so often? Why are they never alone with each other? In the end, their only memories will be of hangovers. I have another moral, Anne.
I suppose this is one of mine, huh? It all depends on if we can save it. Come on, let's go! Miserable slab-sided fleabags! Listen about those cattle we lost. Maybe I made a mistake. - Yeah?
Heavens, child! What is it? These flowers, I can't stand them! They do smell strong, but Mrs. Holmwood said... I don't care what she said! Please, take them away!
I find it ... creepy. Creepiness. There's something peculiar about it. In India,  <hon>people<hoff> see dead people every day and it doesn't scare them. And why?
He also discovered it was Werner? I think he had a hunch. Remember the saw he found in the shack? Werner put a dowel under his shoe, but on the wrong leg. Gran discovered this.
there is only misery as you say, is that the statement, he recognized your two little girls. Yes, of course he recognized the <hon>two good women<hoff> to education, but he sees unclear. he might as well recognize two others Y en a lot who came home. What I found ten and I will bring them to the bar, and see the show
Me, it does not concern me, this is not my business. it is for you to discover the culprits, I defend the innocent. So ! Do you take away confidence now? That said, I'd rather tell you I blacken them as I can, my two innocent.
And for mail, master, what do I do? Simply send me every other day ... Delivery, Megeve. Good, that way there for a long time, everything will be in order. you'll be on your well without me eh, I'll leave it all and then these  <hon>roses<hoff> too, I'll let them, you want them! Why not?
Well, fortunately. You have your parents? No, I have none. They say that sometimes ... when you wish. it's free,
no good... So either. War is declared Bordenave. Frankly, I prefer that, she hates me a good shot, it will occupy it while I will not be there. do not look like it, go, there is nothing bad in there, on the contrary, I can do better for her.
Because it is there, it is silly. Look no sir, I know nothing, I too am afraid. Where are you going ? I go, I go to the police. If it was an accident, the  <hon>cops<hoff> will know.
Hello, I would like to master Gobillot. No, no, no, it's personal. Master Gobillot? No, sir, I do not want an appointment. No, no, no, I will not say my name.
That said, I'd rather tell you I blacken them as I can, my two innocent. for they too could very well make the shot, Only here there is a misfortune, they were not there. They were in the small bar of my friend Gaston, Gaston, which I point you gentlemen, Criminal Records is absolutely virgin! quality essential to a false witness.
A false witness, I answer as myself. tell me, your  <hon>jeweler<hoff> four under, looking good, I do not know me! one would not find a small case of concealment? a tiny gold traffic, it would be the devil. you see, you see ...
What what you need, you're tough. Come, I will show you a little. Look at this ! You do not want a bath? No thanks Okay.
Gee up! - Thank you, my friend. Bye. - Bye. - There was a  <hon>carriage<hoff>.
Don't cry, Mommy. Please don't cry. We'll catch it tomorrow. Don't worry. Please don't worry.
I realize what a poor reward your country offers for the honor you have done them. Nonetheless, I have no choice but to insist. What about my colleagues? There are hundreds of people, there are thousands who share my dream, who've sent money. Mr. Barbicane, when I asked you to come here, I asked it so that you could hear from me personally what no other man outside of my cabinet has ever been told.
Sir... In wartime, I was proud to develop and manufacture the most efficient implements of war that I could. Today we're not at war, the world isn't at war. Am I to stop experimenting, discontinue research merely because my discoveries may have a military application?
You begin to doubt, too, Mr. Von Metz? Yes. I think Victor Barbicane is no longer alive. Do you? I am certain he's alive.
For whom the bells have never toiled Oh, what a poor, defenseless pair In those pathetic rags they wear And there is the future. Someday, each and every one of them will either be married or unmarried.
And treasure it, Hsu Hsien. Yes. Is this a dream? Thank you. The  <hon>stars<hoff> that shine in the night Fell into my hands I will hang them to the hearts of lovers
Incidently if anybody's interested at this late date I got it figured how the critter got aboard. How? It Must've followed us back to the ship, after we picked you up, climbed one of the fins just before takeoff and got in through the open emergency hatch in c compartment. Sounds right. How's the air down there? Pretty bad.
I'm alive, if that's what you mean. I picked a good spot, right between the induction pumps. You mean it can't get at you? It could, if I didn't have this torch. To reach me, it has to stretch down in.
Oh, I think basketball's the largest paid attendance. It's politics. That's right. Politics. Millions and millions of people following it every day... in the newspapers, over the TV, on the radio.
It's politics. That's right. Politics. Millions and millions of people following it every day... in the newspapers, over the TV, on the radio. Now, mind you, they wouldn't get mixed up in this themselves... for all the tea in China... but they know the names and numbers of all the players.
Old Caleb Force fired her... for stealing. Grandmother? Oh, why, that's ridiculous. I mean, well, what did she do about it? Surely in those days,  <hon>people<hoff> must have had some protection.
As a matter of fact, you might even say it was a necessity. You see, you have to remember the existing conditions. Our people were immigrants. They were poor. The  <hon>men<hoff> worked on the do <hon>cks..<hoff>. and the women hired out as maids and cooks... for wages that were next to nothing.
- No harm done, lad. - No, really pretty stupid of me. No harm at all. But there is one more thing I'd like to add. In a little while now, they'll be offering' up the prayers for the dead... and a hundred times more people will be prayin' than would've been there... without your uncle and the politics.
I, for one, refuse to sit at the same table with him. Sit down. Since you admit it is an intrusion, Mr. Skeffington, what do you want? Well, not coffee at any rate. Thank you very much, Bishop Gardiner.
I can give you a case in point. Do you remember, Adam, the statue I promised for them... down in the park at Little Italy? Uh, yeah, that was Christopher Columbus, wasn't it? Well, uh, yes, his name was mentioned... but that happened to be at a communion breakfast of the Knights of Columbus. You know?
Do you remember, Adam, the statue I promised for them... down in the park at Little Italy? Uh, yeah, that was Christopher Columbus, wasn't it? Well, uh, yes, his name was mentioned... but that happened to be at a communion breakfast of the Knights of Columbus. You know? Now, the next day, the Sons of Italy got ahold of me... and, of course, they plugged for Garibaldi.
It means a great deal to have a friend in a man like Frank Skeffington. Do you want one up against the... Well, if it isn't the faithful knight, Sir Roger? Would you step aside while these  <hon>men<hoff> record this great moment in history? Speaking of history, do you suppose there's ever been a candidate... who voted for the other fella?
They got the news over the radio. And I told 'em there was nobody allowed to come in here. All they wanted to do was to bring their presents and be on their way. - Go out and talk to those people. - What? Go out and talk to those  <hon>people<hoff>.
It's ours. You have this musty shrine to your bluenosed ancestors... but my people have the City Hall. And that's what sticks in your craw. You can't swallow it, and you can't forget it. Well, I'm gonna make you eat it.
He's a good boy. He just doesn't like to damage a woman. It's not a matter of sex. If I'd have known it was a woman, I'd have asked double. I don't like  <hon>women<hoff>.
Well, nothing comes to you, Harry, nothing. Except one thing, death. Death comes to you. Comes to everybody. Only everybody thinks they'll live forever. There's a laugh.
- Your mouth. Did you ever handle a gun, George? I ain't talking. How many  <hon>men<hoff> can a bullet kill? One.
I saw it on the front page. That was a policewoman. She made the mistake of trying on Billie's negligee right in front of Billie's door. Now, isn't that a howl? And, you know, when a member of the force gets killed, well, they just go crazy.
- Thanks, sergeant. Hey, it sure makes me proud to know you're sure about me getting classified. He sure didn't pass no eye test. And he ain't gonna be classified. And I'm gonna be permanent latrine orderly.
- Thanks, sergeant. Hey, it sure makes me proud to know you're sure about me getting classified. He sure didn't pass no eye test. And he ain't gonna be classified. And I'm gonna be permanent latrine orderly.
All slicked up for inspection. Explain. Explain. Well, sir I went to a movie last night, sir. And there were these eight infantry men sitting right in behind me.
Well, Ben, Sergeant King and me, we all went to gunnery school together. Like The Three Musketeers. And they put us on this here squadron on this here air base? And it was way out in the middle of the country. You know, out of the way of the other outfits.

Well, what frequency do we desire? Well, I'll leave that up to you. Alrighty. "Adjust Knob B so as to obtain minimum impedance." Hey, listen, Ben.

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty. He always went down to help him carry the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks, and furled it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. No one would steal from the old man, but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home, as the dew was bad for them. Though he was sure no local people would steal from him the old man felt that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.
" Why do they make birds so delicate and fine... "...when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful... "...but she can be so cruel." The sun rose thinly from the sea, and the old man could see the other boats low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current.
Referees were changed every four hours so they'd get some sleep. They fed the Negro rum. Once, after the rum, the Negro made his all-out bid. But the old man raised his hand up to dead even, again. He was sure that he had the Negro who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten.
The sun rose thinly from the sea, and the old man could see the other boats low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as if she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen spoke of her as a contestant or a place, or even an enemy. But the old man had always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors.
Hang out a shingle in some farm town and wait for clients? Why not? You could make a living. Sure. They're waiting in line.
Except me. Get used to it, Rico. I hate to do this. You're making me sound like a lousy guy. Tommy, you know what you told me about this new hip of yours?
Traitors! You know what this means. Freedom for our people. These women aren't alone. There are thousands like them, desperately wishing for the old order.
But, Larry, spaceships are dangerous. I mean, what if it should get lost up there? Or blow up or something? Oh, I wouldn't know what to do without you. I'm sorry, baby, but I don't have any other choice.
- Plastics? It's almost 1:00. What are you talking about? I hope you know what you're doing there. I assume that your motives are good.
I was asking about a way of life, not staying alive. I don't think that Phuong, for example, could tell you the difference. Oh, she can tell the French from the communists, of course. The communists look like her own people, but don't ask her to separate the concepts. Don't expect her to understand ideas. She's far too busy fighting for existence in a world too full of people. Isn't that a frightening assumption? That 22 million  <hon>people<hoff> are content only to stay alive?

Isn't that a frightening assumption? That 22 million people are content only to stay alive? That whether they stay alive under one force or another shouldn't matter to them in the least? They've never known anything else and what they don't know won't hurt them? Isn't it just possible that there's a third choice? A third force? Third force?
It must be a handicap. How do you communicate? Do you show each other your picture books? Communicate? With the American. How do you talk?
- Never? Seems to me she understands about the future very well. Nobody can promise that, Phuong. Even he can't.  <hon>Marriages<hoff> break.
Well, I don't know what I'm talking politics for. They don't interest me. I'm a reporter, I'm not involved. My friend, you are a mass of involvement. I don't take sides. I'd be still reporting whoever wins.
That same 50 years ago, we were barely taken seriously as a nation, much less a great force for wisdom and decision. But suddenly now, a watch-tick of history later, the world waits angrily for us to provide the answers it hasn't been able to find in 50 centuries. French patrol tank. It wasn't as smart as I thought getting your car off the road. Maybe we can signal them on their way back.
The attendance at these celebrations was good. The chief attraction being, not so much the vigorous young religion, as the vigorous young Caodist army of 25,000 men. They were neutral at the moment. But one could always hope. Most important of all was the urgency of getting back to Saigon before sunset. The lonely road through the rice fields was protected during the day.
Oh, perhaps a little English whiskey-soda, thank you. I understand you are not going home, that your newspaper permits you to stay. I only received that  <hon>letter<hoff> this afternoon. When did you read it? This morning.
You just thought... You drove past I do not know how many communist patrols. Through our own bombardment of roads. Is this to be believed? It is to be believed. Was that the French  <hon>bombardment<hoff>?
Now that we've heard your views on the subject, Mr. Malcolm, odd, distasteful and dangerous though they may be, it's time we heard from the others. Mr. Fowler? Well, it's very difficult. I don't see what's difficult about it. But it is, you know. I can't say that I see it like Malcolm.
- Good man. There we are, Miss Cooper. - What can I do for you, Major? - Nothing important. They're sending me  <hon>a copy<hoff> of the West Hampshire Weekly News.
Come along, Mrs. Shankland. You're all right. That's all right, now. - How's the weather, Miss Meacham? - Dry as a bone outside.
Yes, sir, I'll be back. I'll tell the sheriff you was here looking for him. Oh, nothing. I just like to say your name. Tell me, Kate, can a man support a wife on a sheriff's salary?
Our life has changed. My brother doesn't have the Chronicles. Go and tell Fugetsusai. I'm staying here to look for them. All right.
I don't care about your identity. You'd hide the truth anyway. I don't need to know who you are and where you're coming from. I like you, that's all. The  <hon>gods<hoff> are mischievous.
What if I said no? Your family is so famous that you're hiding your origin. I don't want to reveal mine either. Would you like to join us and be our fellow traveller? The sky is becoming overcast.
This is my problem! You understand that? Yeah, I understand. I just came down here to help. I am your brother, you know.
Do you still have that  <hon>stone<hoff> you wear about your neck? No. It's gone. Just as well. Why?
Then stop being a child! Don't you know that when you became a soldier, you contracted for killing in all its forms? I do not think it possible to remake this world... from the basement of a dirty little police station. It doesn't matter what you believe. And I would.
I'm told we had a special call from Selective Service headquarters... asking us not to waste any of your valuable time. Well, we'll try to rush you through quickly. How long will this <hon>show<hoff> run, do you think? I don't know. No one ever does. Well, this is March.
All she needs is a walk. Feel like coming? Better not. I don't want to upset Dr. Blair. M. He seemed happier the last time you saw hi i think so.

Watch out! She just fainted, she will come to momentarily. We must let her rest. Even she noticed. This letter opener is yours, Doctor.
I still can not control this brain. The ideas are very slow, it is sluggish in the thinking process. That is what happened with the body. In the beginning the movements were rigid, now I have more freedom of motion. But I know it, Doctor, I know it, my spirit knows it. It would be impossible to explain what I am telling you.
Is the uh girl safe ? Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car. -Stay here alone? Not on your life.  <hon>-Modern women<hoff>...
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ? -Yes Excellency. How successful has it been ? We have risen two so far. We shall be just as successful on more.
Photographs are tendered to the defence for examination and we move their admission as evidence. Your witness. No questions, no objections. - He took pictures of me that night, too. - Just a minute, Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke, these  <hon>photographs<hoff> offered as evidence:
All my pictures turn out. Of course. I beg your pardon. Did you give the other pictures to the police? Yes, sir, I did. What were they?
I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43. Would Mr. Quill, coming up from the lobby have to pass by that chute on the way to his room? - Yes. - Would it be easy for him to drop something into that chute as he passed? Yes. Have you ever had occasion to go down into the laundry?
Go on. Well, Barney came from somewhere, not the door I left by. He said he was going my way and he could drive me home. He said the bears were prowling around and I oughtn't to walk home. The  <hon>bears<hoff> come out at night to scavenge.
The question and answer will be stricken and the jury will disregard both the question and the answer. That's all. No redirect. The People now call Lloyd Burke. Will the witness step forward, please?
Well, like you said, Professor-- no surprises. You seen anything yet, Sam? Just those frozen vegetables. Any sounds? Not a peep.
Now, is there any way I can get to the outer hull from in here? One place only-- the detector instrument cable access channel. I want to feed the radar power through the outer hull. Can it be done? It would take a lot of rewiring, but, yes, we can do it.
Dr. Wells? There are few killers who kill for the fun of it. The Bat very likely is a mental case. And I'm convinced that his crimes are by his person gain. There's a million dollars at large. And he's going to keep on hunting for it until he lays his hands on it. Now,  <hon>these young ladies<hoff> are staying here tonight?
Well, this is his house. And ever since he died, some funny things have happened here. For instance?  <hon>The housekeeper, the cook, and the butler<hoff> said that they heard strange noises at night. And the upstairs maid swore that she met a man without a face coming up the back stairs.
And ever since he died, some funny things have happened here. For instance?  <hon>The housekeeper, the cook, and the butler<hoff>said that they heard strange noises at night. And the upstairs maid swore that she met a man without a face coming up the back stairs. Oh, so that's why they quit and left me to run this place without a staff.
No, no, and even if I had, I ain't afraid of ghosts. They're afraid of me. Honest, Ms. Corny, a spiritualist told me once that ghosts was allergic to me. But-- but this Bat feller they keep talking about in the paper, I- - I guess he'd be different. I don't think you would have the same effect on him.
Anyway, I don't think the old boy had the guts to steal a million. But if I find those plans, I'll let you know, Andy. Hello, Dale? Look, honey, I haven't seen <hon>those plans<hoff> since I was a kid. But I'll come over tonight, and maybe we can find them. Thank you, mark. We'll expect you.
Put 'em up, Bat. That's a bright idea to kill me in my own lab and let people think that I'm the Bat. But you had to kill me first. What was it to be, ambush? Clever as you are, you're not smart enough to do that. Nor were you smart enough to find t <hon>he money<hoff>, though you came quite close to it.
I didn't come to town for supplies. I came here to get a shave. Look, Blaise, these farmers got a right to live too. Never saw so much stock on your shelves. You're doing a pretty brisk trade with them, Vic. They're decent,  <hon>hard-working folks.<hoff>
With your fists. Shorty, bring that boy. - Come here, sonny. - What do you want him for? He comes with me.
Don't touch that kerosene. We want you to go home. There are three of us. Dan. Roll the  <hon>bottle<hoff> down the bar.

The way the pupils of the eyes are dilated, something must have terrified him. A nightmare, or something worse. There's a policeman outside, nobody could have gotten in without being seen. You're forgetting. The thing that came after your father before left no footprints.
Then hold onto your dreams. Forget tonight. But they seem so stale after tonight. So stale I can't believe in them anymore. M-Maybe I'm a fool.
Forget tonight. But they seem so stale after tonight. So stale I can't believe in them anymore. M-Maybe I'm a fool. Maybe I should see things as they really are... and not as I want them to be.

So, we will talk tomorrow. Do you all agree? - Yes. - I don't. This <hon>affair<hoff> does not concern only myself.
If we could earn that money with those kind of works, ...nobody would work like we do. Don't be anrgy, dad. It's enough to explain them in a comprehensible way. And what will happen to the house, Uncle? That's what I wanted to talk about.
Lad, it's yours. Each coin, as each man, has his voice. What you're missing here there you spare. That's childish, I know more than 100 prayers for profit.

Come, lie down at my feet. You have prayed? No, sir. Well come on, give thanks to God for His Divine Providence. But what are you doing?
But what are you doing? I stir, sir, hunger is not a friend of sleep, and they do not go hand by hand. My luck will change soon, and yours, I am not so poor I have in my country a lot if it were in a Valladolid shore and not 20 miles from the same Valladolid, where it is, it would be worth more than 200 times 1000 maravedis as big and good houses could be built. And I have a pigeon house that if it was not collapsed as it is would each year give more than 200 pigeons if I had pigeons.
If I could catch him... Where could be that thief? ! I think it is not a mouse. Should it be another bug?
How many have no rake-off system or don't cheat on food rations? I doubt if such a group exists. But our problem is how to raise our work attendance rate. Labourers lose the desire to work...

Whether that barbed wire remains or is removed, depends on you! Step along there! Mr. Kaji, if men escape, it mean trouble? Why need they escape?  <hon>Those men<hoff> work before in own village.

No beard, no converts. Excuse me, please. We're only beginning to persuade them to come to hospital to have their babies. Not all of them trust us, yet. Many of them still prefer to deliver themselves in the bush. They scoop out a hole and that's it.
That one. - Everything under control, Mr. Osborne? - Oh, I guess so. Blasted idiots sent me two wrong <hon>components.<hoff> I'll have to get them replaced this afternoon.

If I were you, I'd let him have them on the chance he may call off the siege. I'm doing you no favor. I just happen to be fond of my own skin. So think it over, major. But not for long. And now have the men untie the  <hon>horses<hoff> and turn them loose. It's as unthinkable as surrendering.
- You should have told me, son. I didn't think I ought with such a long hike ahead, sir. I've never been so bad off before. I think it's typhoid. The  <hon>fever<hoff> will go up and down for a day.
I'm sorry. It was a stupid remark. No, I never get used to things. Not everything anyway. You probably love flowers ?
I don't have to answer all these questions. You're asking yourself the same things and you better find a few answers. I'm beggining to think the only answer is for me to go away myself. There are other men in the world, Ralph is begginig to talk to them on the radio. They're thousands of miles away, it'll be years before any of us get togehter. Meanwhile, they'll talk on the radio !
That's why the hawks don't catch them... because they don't see them. They don't see them way up in that high blue sky near the sun. What about in gray weather? They fly so high. In gray weather, the hawks, they'd get dizzy.

There's a kind of bird that... don't have any legs so it can't alight on nothing. So it has to spend its whole life on its wings in the air. I seen one, once. It died and fell to earth. Its body was light blue colored.

I don't recognize that planet. It's Antarssis 135-sub-2, planetoid of the 4th order. How do you know?

What do you want to say? Soon you're going to have a child. For you that is an unknown experience. An ignorant girl has seen many puppies born. With people it is a little different. Try to remember what an old mother tells you now. First of all at the last moment,  <hon>the child<hoff> is afraid to come out.
It's not true. Swedish girls don't act the way they do here. Most of them are dogs like Parisian girls. No, Swedish girls are very pretty. It's a myth. One or two maybe, like in Paris or London, but not all of them.

In short, it becomes a power upon which we may count. And that is not all. A woman of a competence that Hell would not disavow opens her eyes on herself and feels pity for her husband. She will perhaps even become a good wife. Nor is this all?
Entirely. I present you my friend... of which I spoke you. And his/her/its fiancée... I share your ideas on the woman...

Now when is it my turn to be rude to you? And you wouldn't feel properly dressed unless you had a camera slung around your neck. You mean like a Englishman and his umbrella? That is our climate. You don't mean to tell me that those things are actually constructed to unroll

Now, this book goes into a lot of "begats". "And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. " And so on and so on and so on. Are these pretty important people? They are the generations of the  <hon>holy men and women<hoff> of the Bible.

What's your name? Nowadays I have no name. This is a quiet, lonely place. You're a long way from neighbors. I hear what I want to hear and see what I want to see.
As if whimpering and afraid. Yet it's only going out into the open air, where it has the whole sky to tumble about in. But it doesn't know that. So it cowers and trembles under the sooty ridge of the roof. People are the same way.

There is no triumph for me. I shall lose, whatever happens My husband on one side, my son on the other Now you must choose son or husband Queen of the Rajpoot wives, women of honour, why do you hesitate? Daughter of proud warriors, why do your hands tremble?
Fujisaki, I... I've always loved you. I love you too. So? I love you more than I love anybody, but I don't have the courage to destroy my home. It's selfish of me, but I can't help it.

Silence. Silence! Quiet!  <hon>You civilians,<hoff> get those hats off! Put out those cigars!
And may I also point out to the court that in violation of all the rules and procedures, Defense Counsel is interrupting my argument. You may not! Now, the one overriding rule of this court-martial, or any court-martial, is to seek out truth and administer justice, and that is exactly what we're going to do. Take your places. Gentlemen, in my opinion, this entire case hangs on  <hon>this little cross<hoff>.

I've been on 100 jobs, none of which altered the war. There've been 1000 wars and there'll be 1000 more, until we're all dead. I don't care about the war anymore. I care about Roy! And if Turkey enters on the wrong side? So what?
But I'm banking on this job being our insurance. - What happens? - Would you bring down the hoist? Whoa, that's enough! See this  <hon>bottom runner<hoff>?

"Like pictures, they were then hanged by hooks on the walls." The bodies of those who had come in boxcars, without food and without air, who hadn't survived the journey to Dachau. Hundreds of inmates were used as human guinea pigs for atrocious medical experiments. A witness at an execution at Dachau gave the following description: " <hon>Inmates<hoff> were made to leave their clothing on a rack."
Withdraw? We can't. If we withdraw under pressure, our prestige all over the world is threatened. The  <hon>Communists<hoff> will move in on every front. What about these trials, General? How do you feel about them now? We're committed to the trials, but I think it would be realistic to accelerate them as much as possible.
We're going to need the support of the German people. More strudel, gentlemen? Herr Janning, you may proceed. I wish to testify about the Feldenstein case because it was the most significant trial of the period. It is important not only for the tribunal to understand it, but for the whole German people.
We were a bulwark against Bolshevism. We were a pillar of Western culture. A bulwark and a pillar the West may yet wish to retain. The defendant Friedrich Hofstetter may address the tribunal.

Well, aren't you? - You want a hand with that? - No, sir. I've got them both almost through. Captain, do you think that  <hon>balloon<hoff> will fly in a big wind like this without busting open? That's not the problem, Herbert.
Stay here...? Those Portuguese boats claim to be commodity trading ships... But I'm sure they carry guns and gun powder. Is there a way to get them? I've been working on it, getting at it every chance I get. But the f <hon>oreign merchants<hoff> aren't involved with either Toyotomi or Tokugawa.
You pretend as if you've been wounded. You load the guns on the boat. And put the woman in a casket and load it with them. Hey, it's incredibly heavy, isn't it? Don't talk!
I've seen many nicer and many uglier faces. I was wrong to say you never understood me. You did, at least you put up with me. You shouldn't take everything so seriously. Come on, drink up.
-Listen, this can't be- -Go to the men's room, you scoundrel - No, I-I-I - Mr Quintanilla, you have to pay me right away. Look, look, a bank note A NOTE. It's the same to you to pay me now or after the parade No, listen, this is a matter for the  <hon>charity women<hoff>
Leave it, Leave it. Well, with all this, those people haven't compensated me. Oh no? Well then tomorrow. Tomorrow!
- I'm fleeing from Armageddon, sir. With my cardiac condition I just cannot take unhappy endings. - So I'm off to join Mr. Kent in Havana. - With two broken legs? My  <hon>legs<hoff>, sir?
It sure looks big. They got a line of cars out here a block long. - Stay on his tail. Don't let him get away. - Right. Let's close off the block.
Millions of 'em. - <hon>Cops<hoff>? - What do we do now? We can't go over to Annie's. They'll follow us. Queenie, get the judge on the phone. We gotta stall 'em.

I'm sure you'll seduce the sick. - Do you believe in psycho-analyse? - Yes! Let me tell you a dream. I was in a desert and I saw a  <hon>camel<hoff>.
In a motel. Where? In Africa, I believe. Unfaithful  <hon>women<hoff> are stripped, beaten up and killed with stones. Ten by day.
A Cedric, 550.000. And we have the ones that are imported, A Hillman costs 480.000. And a Renault, 330.000. Not a Renault, they are tiny. Right, mommy?
It's no biggie. Suit yourself. Who were those  <hon>boys<hoff>? They are my students. I see!
Love. Affection. Pity or weariness? What're you saying? What nonsense? Don't you see how much I like you? No.
Yet it's a magnificent reception, full of rich, beautiful, carefree people. You're not in a good mood? I'm sorry, why? O it doesn't matter. Look at these happy people.
Because she saved my life. As the guards searched the house, your father brought me here in his carriage. But maybe I'll die anyhow. The wound is very painful. You need a surgeon, quickly.
The happy day will come when power will pass to the people. And the King will be the servant of the collectivity. This is the meaning of the French Revolution. Your present security is an illusion! All over Europe there are  <hon>millions of people<hoff>who are hungry. And you think you can satisfy them with charity.
Pietro, we've so many things to do together. We've never even gone for a walk. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll go to America. Would you like that?
God bless you! Did you enjoy your meal? With all due respect respect to our holy benefactress, these  <hon>green beans<hoff> are sourish. - What does that mean? - Sour!
You lout! Don't you have any pity? I don't know. Ask him.  <hon>Demons<hoff>!
You can leave tomorrow then. Your belongings for the trip are in your cell. Try to show him some affection. Stop it, now. Do you like this  <hon>rope<hoff>?
All of Copenhagen is dancing Laughter and light Come hold me tight This is a place for romancing Down by the lake,  <hon>lovers<hoff> dream to a song

We are all familiar with the fact that a common lizard can lose his tail and grow a new one. A starfish will regrow an entire new organism from each one of its separate arms. And a flatworm can be cut into many pieces, and each separate piece will regenerate itself into a complete animal, including such complicated organs as its brain, eyes, and digestive system. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what is going on in that tank. What do you call the thing?
Are you ready to hear the laws sacred to a Spartan warrior? - Yes, Queen Gorgo. - Here they are. You must treasure freedom above life. Shun pleasure for the sake of virtue. Endure pain and hardship in silence. Obey orders implicitly.
Archers! (narrator) "O stranger, tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their word." This last message of the fallen heroes rallied Greece to victory. First at Salamis, as predicted, and then at Plataea. But it was more than a victory for Greece.
Lucky Thermopylae is the only  <hon>way<hoff> through. You mean it's lucky that the Persians don't know the other way. - Is there another way? - Yes. There is an old goat track. It winds through the mountains and it comes down beyond the pass.
Strangely enough, he makes the dish seem palatable. He makes us all want to sit at his table. He calls himself a curmudgeon. Well, I hope the day never comes... when there is not at least one curmudgeon in this body... to goad us in the right direction. I can't agree with him about Mr. Leffingwell. I don't interpret Mr. Leffingwell in the same way. I don't hear an alien voice.
And the only robot who claim that distinction. I don't know what you're talking... I was a child. I grew up. I remember it all.
One of the first steps was the magnetic integrated neuron duplicator, a device one one-hundredth of the size of a golf ball which duplicated portions of the human nervous system and carried out learning processes. Automation was also well on its way. But these too, were cumbersome and needed further development before the two elements could be joined in the series R-1 robot. This first robot was quite ungainly and its functions were limited. But refinements came in rapid succession and soon the R-20 was capable of all the thought processes and functions of a man.
I'm sorry Miss, I just thought, well with so many robots about these... I feel perfectly safe with robots. We intend to see that you are. A most attractive woman. Most.
But he's without a past, without hope. The dream gone. Almost like being a robot, isn't it? No offense. I'm incapable of taking offense. But why is it the more we become like men, the more some of them hate us for it?
The series 21 through 70, the  <hon>humanoids<hoff>, the ones we're concerned with eliminating represent only about 20% of a billion odd robots. One of them killed. What's happening to them? They hold menial jobs that bring them in constant contact with us. They're conditioned reflexes make them imitative.
I think I can speak positive on that point. The robot denied it when wired for absolute truth. They found him dead. Well, if the man was dead, how would he have a memory? Memory consists of facts.
Why should we learn mathematics when the computers can find the solutions better and faster? We don't even control them anymore. The brains are designed by other brains. The  <hon>robots<hoff> improve themselves. We don't know how.
Arnesen Nursery. That's us. That was us. I just couldn't take it. Oh, my father's a wonderful man, good man. But I kept thinking to myself: "You're pretty. You're pretty, and here you are. "
But why? Have I not lived here, like a slave, far from my home? Shall we start all over again? You threw me out of my father's palace. Yes, I know.
I see your husband on the road. He's returning from work. No, God! This can't be your husband! Who are those  <hon>strangers<hoff> in front of my house?
"Funny, isn't it? "Small and funny "And fine" Sometimes it's a real fine world, Rose like tonight. But there's tomorrow.
As one cannot duel here, we will repair to the Plains of Gojin-ln Hovel that it is, the owner may be annoyed if you fail to return And someone must come to dispose of your corpse I suggest a short note stating that you proceed to the Plains of Gojin-ln to duel with Hikokuro Omodaka He wisely took advantage of the winds
- Can't you chop it down or something? Oh, I get it. You like it because you can tuck yourself away at the top of the stairs and keep an eye on daddy with all those sexy models. Mm-hmm, an excellent perch. Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she is. But there's nothing in the book that says good people can't meet bad people and turn out not so good. You don't think she'll go back there, do you? Not if you insist that she doesn't but you know what happened to Juliet when the parents interfered. I want Charlotte to get married, but to a man with principles.
Well, we're hardly Romeo and Juliet. In fact, we're hardly anything at all. And after tonight, probably we won't ever see each other again. Ever... Probably. You know, the agency  <hon>men<hoff> think you're beautiful.
- The worst kind. Sit down, Tina. Would you like a drink? Mm. Scotch on the rocks. Are you gonna look for a job, do you think?
You in tree, listen! Flood come. Much water. You stay in tree. I bring help. - My father? - I wake him.
Get this crate down in the hull, would ya, lads? Motley looking lot of fellows you've got together. Well, when you look for men to go into Maori country... you don't choose them from among the socially elite. Jolly well put. But I must say, I didn't realize you'd require quite so much merchandise. Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone when one could impress  <hon>the natives<hoff> with a handful of coloured beads.
In the whole world, no place has such big... such beautiful, such magnificent earthquakes as right here. But it is one chance in a million we should be so fortunate. Yes. Yes. Yes, of course. Besides, this  <hon>place<hoff> looks as if it's been here for hundreds of years. Doesn't it?
Your pardon, sir. You've come none too soon. Please be about your duties without delay. Your indulgence, sir. I have two charming friends here who insist upon seeing me to my ship.
Come down on deck, you clumsy lubbers! And that jib, hoist it taut. Land ho! Land ho! This island is inhabited by over 200,000  <hon>savages<hoff>.
It may sound improbable, but do you know the goodwill in the hearts of our crew turned out to be practically boundless. And the Tahitian ladies gave them every opportunity to prove it. You see, to the Tahitians, a light skin was a mark of beauty. Men with fair complexions, like  <hon>Englishmen<hoff>, were regarded as beautiful. No matter how nonsensically their features were arranged.
And the Tahitian ladies gave them every opportunity to prove it. You see, to the Tahitians, a light skin was a mark of beauty. Men with fair complexions, like  <hon>Englishmen<hoff>, were regarded as beautiful. No matter how nonsensically their features were arranged. They were beautiful and they could do no wrong.
A larger cat-o'-nine-tails to run it with. You're forgetting there's mates of ours went along with Bligh, sir. They'll tell what the old pig did. And they'll tell how he was out to execute all of us, one by one. Sure.
You're forgetting there's mates of ours went along with Bligh, sir. They'll tell what the old pig did. And they'll tell how he was out to execute all of us, one by one. Sure. Your friends are under the shadow of arraignment themselves for mutiny, if Bligh chooses to charge that they failed to rally to his calls, or to protect him properly.
- Well, join the party at the gangway. - Thank you, sir. As you know, Tafoa is due west, 40 leagues. You have your compass. This book is sufficient for its purpose.
And if it isn't done well, it can be laughed at. And it's a very famous scene. The critics know it. I will do my best. You see, the  <hon>camera<hoff> is a large magnifying glass.
I knew there was an American tendency, but they are making a fetish of it. They're not Japanese anymore. Look at them. I felt this problem when I got off the plane and saw the neon signs. That's just why I want to do this picture.
Just tonight. All right, Carlye, give me the ticket. I said, give me  <hon>the ticket<hoff>. I don't have it. - What do you mean, you don't have it?
- Say something nice to him. - Just make for that buoy. Where's my knife? What happened to my  <hon>knife<hoff>? Easy, nothing gets lost on this boat. I didn't say it was lost.
He would be here now, tending to his sunburn. With all that money, we could buy a whole island. And a Rolls Royce. Why not a skyscraper? We change nothing.
- How can one play, then? - I'm the jester. - And I'm the queen. - Why? - Why not?
Oh, yes, of course... but, well, you're on your own so much... and I worry about you. You must be patient with me. All right. In the meantime... I'll brighten up that dreary old house. There.
Then I do pronounce you man and wife. Champagne, Lady Catherine? Thank you. Oh, yes, a beautiful ceremony. A toast... to the  <hon>most beautiful bride... and the most fortunate groom who ever lived.<hoff>
How can I? He won't come out of that terrible place... and won't let me in. All he wants to do is just sit and brood. Miles, you've got to do something. Emily, I'm afraid I've done all I can.
Good lesson. Excuse me. The lady is naive in every sense of the word. She's stupid, that's all. You mean the  <hon>horsemen<hoff> weren't the conspirators?
Poor men! You don't know anything. -They'll attack you soon. -What? The  <hon>conspirators<hoff>, of course. They're next door waiting for my signal.
One, two, three. Port arms. One, two. Order arms. Where'd you get this  <hon>blunderbuss<hoff>?
If you need me at all, please call me. All right. Now, sleep well. You need to get a good night's rest. "It was dusk when the  <hon>two travelers<hoff> finally arrived at the lakeshore and black storm clouds were gathering in the sky.
Who can you be to have this mysterious power over me? Who can you be that you poisoned all the love I bore my husband and made me become your slave? Show yourself to me. Where are you hiding? This black night makes me fear you.
When I passed the Ewell place... Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were. She said for me to come there and help her a minute. I went inside the fence... and I looked around for some kindlin' to work on, but I didn't see none. Then she said to come in the house... she has a door needs fixin'.

She tempted a Negro. She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that, in our society, is unspeakable. She kissed a black man. Not an old uncle... but a strong, young Negro man.
You're not from the same family. If you have come to give me orders, I will kick you out from here. That's just a warning shot. Leave it to me! Leave, or I am calling the police! They shouldn't have released them!
What? A bad traffic jam in Hennequeville? Well, what's your problem? I think I'm ashamed. You shouldn't be ashamed, when you've won such a bullfight.
You've got your troubles, I've got mine. Tough! Listen. Give me some credit. Don't make me sell everything! You can't speculate with my hide! If the  <hon>market<hoff> drops, I pay.
This day, this moment, goes back 4 or 5 thousand years. Nothing particular is happening. Now as in the past, life goes on under the eternal guide of their instinct for work, leisure, children, food, human contact and an orderly social life. a Catholic mission marks the extreme outpost of civilization. Five missionaries have been killed in recent years before the sound of a bell could awake, through these old valleys, the instinct of faith.
Five missionaries have been killed in recent years before the sound of a bell could awake, through these old valleys, the instinct of faith. Here, after hundreds of centuries spent in the dark, men discover, for the first time, that there's a doubt, a question they cannot answer, sense of anguish, unknown so far, which is not hunger or thirst or physical pain, but that hurts, nonetheless, like a wound. It's the anguish that follows men from the beginning to the end of world. But they still don't know it.
Head blindly onwards ...across each mistaken first impression. Pain spread across landscapes you cross but can never reach. The relationship becomes less obvious, ...and yet more rapid. Neutral elements, ...weaving and binding together with decisive intensity, ...evolving together towards an agreement both calm and disturbed. One is now increasingly replaced by a clear and sure movement.
Her father is a bigwig in the army. He's a semi-invalid now, but NATO have seen fit to bring him out of retirement and give him a job as a technical advisor while Kathleen is looking after him... Thought you'd go along and see her? Oh, poor Kathleen, of course, I'd love to go and see her. Good. How's life here, eh? Um... what are the  <hon>girls<hoff> like?
Can you come to bed now? No, I wanna run over and see him now. So you get some sleep. I'll be back a bit later. I've been trying to sleep, but it's a little difficult with all those  <hon>lizards<hoff> all over the ceiling.
This murder has topped the whole thing right off. I ordered that security you requested, and I think that's going to help a lot. No, it's not. Excuse me. It's not. The people up there don't even trust their own neighbor anymore.
I'm the one who called you in. On first reading it's evident that the film lacks a problematic, or a philosophical premise... Would you like to sit down? ...making the film a series of gratuitous episodes, perhaps amusing for their ambiguous realism. One wonders what the  <hon>authors<hoff> are trying to say...

-What for? -l want you to talk to it. -Go to your house and talk to it? -Yes, yes. A house is like- - Like a living thing.
Those things out there. Well, to use a term of Earth's, I suppose we should call them insects. -Ants? -Hm. I've seen a colony of ants eat their way right through a house.
Well, to use a term of Earth's, I suppose we should call them insects. -Ants? -Hm. I've seen a colony of ants eat their way right through a house. That size, they could eat their way through a mountain.
One wonders what the authors are trying to say... Are they trying to make us think? To scare us? From the start, the action reveals a poverty of poetic inspiration. Forgive me, but this might be the definitive proof that cinema is 50 years behind all other arts.
Yes, I decided to buy a faster one. With 8-cylinders. What do you say? Meanwhile, you will walk? Don't be silly. I'll go by taxi.
Where is the fourth member of our party, hm? Well? She has been taken to the Crater of Needles beyond my great web. Will your secrets look into the stars? I don't know what you mean. But I have an astral map if that answers your question.
Yes! The Daleks can never land here! The girls have gone. Vicki! Barb...
One of our friends will be able to help us. Yeah, sure. You can rely on them! Go ahead. You think I'm an idiot?
Well, what kinds of wards did you work in? All kinds. Give me a hint. General, surgery, infectial diseases, that's where I caught everything. OB. That was for the officers'  <hon>wives<hoff>.
And as long as you've been here, nothing has happened. Nothing from him and nothing from you. I'm a patient woman, Captain. Maybe too patient. I beg your pardon?
Sit down. Doc! Leibowitz, this is a perfectly safe ward. There is no danger involved.  <hon>Patients<hoff> in my ward are not allowed to have matches or razors or sharp objects of any kind.
He sure does have a way with them. Holy Mother of God. Pray for us. The miracle of the leaking steam pipe... courtesy of the Cornelius J. Deegan Construction Company. And I thought this was a special effort for my conversion.
This house is exactly what you would expect in a nightmare! Yes, we're in a world of dreams creaking doors, thunder and lightning, monsters and all the things that go bumpety bumpety in the night! Hmm? With one vital difference, Doctor. This house is real. It exists.
How well the new plaster and wood matches the old. They all comment on it, Corny. And what do you say to that? The job was done by the Cornelius J. Deegan Construction Company... without charge, as a donation to the parish. That's telling 'em, Monsignor... but let me give you some of my cards for next time it comes up.
When the waters were gone, they invaded our cities. There were too many of them. We tried to destroy them! They multiplied too quickly for us. We were driven back as the Mire Beasts took over more and more of our beautiful city.
Hurry, Mrs. Lampert. - I'm leaving right away. Good-bye. Reggie! The  <hon>stamps<hoff>!
We tried to destroy them! They multiplied too quickly for us. We were driven back as the Mire Beasts took over more and more of our beautiful city. These Mire Beasts - what do they feed on, mmm? They are... flesh eaters.
Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or I'll kill you. It won't get you the stamps, Dyle. You'll have to come out to get them... and I'm not likely to miss at this range. Maybe not, but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach.
- Well, come on. You can't stay here. - I don't know where to go. We'll find you a hotel. Nothing too expensive. I'm not a lady of leisure anymore, you know.
Look, two of our friends went out into the desert. Will you help us find them? When did you see them last? Last night. The Mire Beasts hunt at night.
- It's not like  <hon>people<hoff> read that much. - Oh, but they sure do sell! In Italy the book has become a consumer good these days. But do they read them? - How should I know?

They're not all skinny. You know, like those ladies in the comic books who are no good. They always got skinny eyes. Skinny eyes. Anything else? There's one other thing, but... it's about sex. Go ahead. I can stand it.
A touch of flu, 24-hour variety. He'll bounce back fast. You know, he's quite a boy, that Eddie. - He let me in on a great medical secret. - What was that? He told me that brave  <hon>boys<hoff> don't bleed much when they're hurt.
I'm afraid I can't see any signs of a city, hmm! This... this old air-lock, we used it when our city was beneath the sea. It will take us to a part of our home that is still free from Mire Beasts. Well, we're very grateful for your hospitality but I must you the Daleks are right on top of us. And I don't want either you or your people involved in any of this dangerous business.
At the beginning is all. They're nice at the beginning... 'cause they don't want you to hate school right off. But after Christmas they don't care anymore. They let you hate it. Will you visit camp with Dad? Maybe. We'll see about that. Now that I'm gone... maybe you can have discussions with Dad.
Are you sure this is the right way? 'Course I am - come on! The prisoners have escaped from the Aridians. Are we to proceed with the destruction of the underground city? The Aridians have one hour to re-capture the humans.
Nobody gets through here! I'm Captain Prince Tancredi Falconari. I fought at Palermo with you. Captain, I have my orders. This is an order, too. Clear the way!
- Yes, Concetta. The villa I'm having built outside the village will be modest, but very comfortable. How hungry we are. A good thing we didn't start with soup. Unforgettable days, I tell you. Only one word of command, from mouth to mouth: arms and soldiers.
Tor is late. It's not like him. I know. He did contact the group in the next sector? Yes, but the Moroks are out checking.
It's our fault. But we are very tired, empty, burnt-out. But all that is finished now. Sicily is no longer a land of conquest, but a free part of a free state. The intention is good, but it arrives late. A sleep, my dear Chevalley.
For 2,500 years we've been nothing but a colony. I don't say that to scourge myself. It's our fault. But we are very tired, empty, burnt-out. But all that is finished now. Sicily is no longer a land of conquest, but a free part of a free state.
Why? You don't want to answer? Very well, I'll try another. Where are your companions? We can get all the information we require without the need to resort to brute force.
Let the buzzards have her. No, I don't believe I will. I'll call the government man and ask him to take a look. Bring someone in to tell you how to run your business, just don't ask my opinion. I'd like you and Lon to stay out here for a while.
Vicki, are you all right? Yes... yes thanks. How about the others? They're fine. Now Vicki, remember the Doctor's device?
It's too late. You already found him. You hardly touched your plate. Nothing to do with your cooking. I just ain't hungry. - Anything from the  <hon>vets<hoff>?
Who are you? We are the Rills. Why can't I see you? It is better that you do not. Not all the dominant species in the universe look like humans.
When I was your age, I couldn't get enough of anything. That was the summer you were born. Your ma died. And your daddy was feeling a little wild about things. We bought us a '27 Chevy.
Mmm, if I had nothing better. Well, the meeting must start soon. You appear so keen to be a model delegate one might think you are afraid of the Daleks. A dangerous statement. Remember where you are.
We have a  <hon>flower<hoff> in Colchis which heals and soothes. Tomorrow, I'll show you. What do you call the flower? It has no name. It grows on a double stalk.
So have many men. They say it is a gift of the gods. It has the power to heal, bring peace and rid the land of plague and famine. If I could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule. They would know the gods have not abandoned them.
Even if it's his own father. Why would he kill himself? I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense. Kimiko, forgive me.
Had the master of the Fifth Galaxy been less arrogant he would have gone with me to the meeting. Instead he preferred to keep us all waiting. I believe the intruders came from the Solar System. Did you see them? No.
- How did it go? - Great. Mother, I'll bring you tobacco tomorrow. Alright. Hurry up bringing me the other thing, yes? What a look for her age.
Here. Well, my dear fellow, that's magnificent. Huh, it's all so convenient, isn't it? Now play that tape I gave you, before I went to the Daleks' conference. What tape's that?
Why didn't you tell me anything? What an idea, killing yourself with this slut! You are stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid! That's the way  <hon>men<hoff> are...
Father? It still sounds strange to my years... You'll have to be a good father... You who go away for our Emperor to work... in this glorious morning one million voices to the sky do proclaim: Forward, you brave our mother and father's sons!
Then your accusation is preposterous. How was it the intruders knew that the Taranium was here and that it was to be handed over if they did not come from the Solar System? None of the others knew what it was that representative Mavic Chen was bringing here! Have you nothing to say? Oh, this is absurd.
It sounds fascinating. We've put you in Tony's old room. I probably won't recognize it. It's been so long. No, probably not.
Yes, possible. If you hadn't killed Daxtar, of course, there wouldn't be any need to. Of course there would. We wouldn't have been able to believe anything he said. Well, there's not much point in standing here discussing it any longer.
That was champagne, nothing more. Well, whatever it was, it was very interesting. - I really don't remember. - That's such an awful old cliche. - It's true.
If I'm not being too nosy, Your Highness... I read somewhere there was some dispute over the ownership of the Pink Panther. It belongs to me. It was a gift from my late father. - I shall never surrender it. - Why should you?
I mean, I'm just going to. I'm cold. - My Stradivarius. - The porter just brought it in. I sent it to the village to be repaired.
- I really don't remember. - That's such an awful old cliche. - It's true. - You know, the majority of women... they have half a glass too much and let down the barriers a little... then they wake up in the morning riddled with guilt... and think they can reclaim their virtue by saying, "I don't remember." Are you saying my  <hon>virtue<hoff> is not intact?
It's there. Something's inside our body to periodically bring back memories. I may be fine today, but you never know when the disease will eventually get you. You know, the  <hon>A-bomb Survivors Hospita<hoff>l used to report every single death.
The funeral procession with MM. Pineau, Schuman, Bidault and other deputies depose a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe. Afterwards the crowd attacks the French communist party's headquarters and sets fire to it. This snow is last year's snow, or the snow of a 1000 years ago, or the snow before all hope. It is our mothers, our children and grand-children, our old parents, identical figures following journeys of tears, who are crying. 1943, 1944 These are the years of whiteness, of emigrations.
I don't want you to misunderstand, but you... Did you kill it? This is a dead butterfly. It is no more a butterfly. A butterfly is supposed to be flying.
Nobody left for ever and ever. Now, listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late.
"What I have promised, I'll do, so help me God." Ah, sweet queen, touching bourgeois wife, shy even with her inferiority complex and her good manners which prevent her being natural. Ah, the reforms, certainly civil, astonishingly so. But what will be the future for workers who strike for the right to a tea-break? The idyll is hard, sober, severe:
Give me those communicators before it's too late. You've seen your friends change, one by one, as they grew up. Did you ever see one of them not change? They got the disease. They became like those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise!
Pisa, Genua, Amalfi et Venice, evoke a distant period by displaying a naval competition before the Predident. In the streets of Pisa and on the quays symbolic figures of the four republics pass in procession: first Amalfi, then Genua, Venice and Pisa. Drum rolls, trumpet calls.
"which lives in this spirit." Are these the words the angel whispers into the ear of this sweet pope with his peasant and mysterious face? A nation starting again on its history, gives its people back, first of all, the humility to resemble their fathers in all innocence. Tradition, that is greatness expressed in just one gesture.
We couldn't begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like animals. Only children. Miri said all the adults died. That creature which attacked us was certainly no child.
- Liar! Fibber. Fibber! Fibber! It's dead. - lt's incredible. - What is?
Fibber. Fibber! Fibber! It's dead. - lt's incredible. - What is? Its metabolic rate. lt's impossibly high, as if it burned itself up.
Why don't you wear the brown one? It's nicer. I want to wear the houndstooth, and I can't find it! Now, have you seen it or not? -You're shouting.
She doesn't like too many toys in her crib. Well, she'll like this one. Sleep well, little... Tabatha. Sorry to have brought you out here, Mr. Hockstedder but I'm afraid the toy just doesn't work anymore.
It has no reason to suppress the truth, it has no emotions. It is our soul. It seems to me, by the way you're talking that this machine can think for itself like a human being ! It can. Only much more accurately. ... but sir, I mean, isn't this kinda risky ? Y'know ? I mean,
Listen to me! You think that good can be done only single-handedly? Good! Have you forgotten the New Testament? Jesus gathered people in the temples, too. He taught them.
You think that good can be done only single-handedly? Good! Have you forgotten the New Testament? Jesus gathered people in the temples, too. He taught them. And then they gathered together in order to execute Him.
Well? This mould won't hold, we'll have to twine it all around. It's time to coat it with clay, and you haven't made the mould yet! We need to reinforce it more, but there're no more twigs. Finish it up, we must start baking the clay by the evening.
I'd have taken vows of schema long ago and settled down in a cave for good. I serve God, not people. Today they praise, tomorrow they'll abuse what they praised only yesterday, and after that they'll forget both you and me. They'll forget everything! All is vanity! All is useless!
She watches. You do not have to go to Cocatlan, señor, to get to Batopilas. I know a very good road. It will save you five, maybe six hours. Well, I've heard about the women in Cocatlan, and I've been alone for 2 weeks now, and I was looking forward a little bit to see them, you know.
Get up. You better start makin' some sense, mister, 'cause you're makin' a big mistake. Get up! She was tryin' to run away on that horse, Chuy. I was buying that horse from the gringo in the church.
- Jose know a lot about them. - And I hope to know more. Not much time left. The day will come when rabbits will eat up the human species. They'll invade us and form a new civilization.
- And I hope to know more. Not much time left. The day will come when rabbits will eat up the human species. They'll invade us and form a new civilization. And since they're smaller than we are... There'll room for them all. Class struggle will disappear.
- What did you watch on TV last night? - "I can't remember. - And how were you killed? - "With dogs, the dogs would bite me. - Dogs?
Thus shall be the end of the world. All burning in the eternal fire. Amen. - Won't the flames spread? - For what this is worth...
Here's the harbour. Here's a big ship that arrived from Spain. I did what you said. I got the people's faces. Look at them.
- Have you confirmed? Yes, that's all been taken care of. However, I'm worried about the crowds at the L.A. Airport coming to see the Russian. I was told there is some transportation I could take to avoid the crowds. I'll radio ahead to  <hon>customer service<hoff>.
- I could do it. I don't want anybody going out to the airport. Miles, that goes for you too. I have to memorise this whole system? There's more than 63 wires here.
Come on, close your eyes. Don't move. Don't look. Now, turn around. Dear husband: Use this recorder in the best of health.

Listen to me, and you'll manage to save yourself. Make yourself as pretty as you can, it won't be hard. Thanks, but it's pointless. Damn! That's Jackson having fun.
Welcome! Make yourselves at home. Come.. Unfortunately, it's not all of it, but, as soon as I am able to.. I believe you, Nathaniel. I believe you.
It certainly won't be the lost gold, my friend, that will change my fate. We'll go back to Mexico anyway, right? The decision has already been made. Now we are even, Django. You saved my life two times, and I did the same, back then and now.
The gold will help me make him disappear forever. Let go of that gold, Django! What do you care about it? We'll start a new life together. I'll help you forget. I love you, Django.
(Reid) we've no choice. We've got to take them out. No. We've still got 51 minutes. Leave 'em in. But it's hopeless.
The pressure. I... - I can't... - Get back to the sub. I'll get her out. (Cora) Hurry! - Where are they? - They're below the cells of Hensen.
- Get back to the sub. I'll get her out. (Cora) Hurry! - Where are they? - They're below the cells of Hensen. If the antibodies reach her, they'll attack as if she were bacteria. (Cora) Open it!
One more thing. It'll be safer if everybody leaves the sub but me. I'll get the equipment. Cora? - You didn't fasten it down too well. - But I did!
Is your Jewess that demanding? That's not it! I have to keep my promise to the soldiers. Be prudent, Ramses. Those girls choose death over the bed of a stranger.
He was the first to attack. Ramses showed great courage, but if you had such a hothead in your ranks would you praise him so extravagantly? Tell me no wrong of this young warrior! He as already shown his stripes. He will be a great commander.
Think of the pharaohs who have agonised in atrocious suffering. You forget about them. And my father? And me? Is death sweeter for us than for your peasant?
Almost all the people are against us. People change like flour in the wind. And the army? What army would resist Osiris? Sure, but I don't see Osiris, nor the wind that should bring back the people.
Yes. How did you do it? Like this. You are Kama... who wakes over the holy flame? Yes.
I must bathe. At least. Shall I send the girl to you, say, in one hour? At least. Home at last. After years of searching for my long lost children, how good it is to see this street once more.
- Not my own. - You like him? - I like him. Have him. Congratulations, your life has been spared.
Throw me in a piece of fried bread, would you? Long life and happiness. Yes. Good luck, mate. You'll need it with her for a mother.
You're about to find it again. If you follow my instructions exactly... no harm will come to you. But annoy me with the slightest objection... and I'll shoot you down. Take this pendulum. Hold your hand steady.
Take this pendulum. Hold your hand steady. Observe the key carefully... and imagine it's swinging in a circle. Look only at the key. Concentrate on the key.
Have you understood, Miss Dickinson? The photographers send them to hell! It would have been fair saving my life in exchange of the crown... Instead you wanted to recover the heirloom and send me to the gallows. I have thought well to avoid this disagreeable solution. As far as the crown, I'm giving it back intact.
And now he has a super helio-beam. - I figured he had something. - This beam can knock out an army, Matt a city, a continent! It can bring peace or complete annihilation. It's a dreadful responsibility.
Not like that. Carefully. So nobody can tell. Observe. See, carefully. That's interesting and spicy. That's excellent.
You probably don't have rabbit either. They have venison, miss. No. That's too much. I only want a bite of something. I'll have the chicken.
Alva what does Mardi gras mean? Mardi gras means carnival. I'm gonna go next year, even if I have to ride the rails. I'm gonna design my own costume out of black shiny sequins, so that my skin'll look white against it and I'll glitter when I walk, sparkle when I dance with all those men in masks. And I'll never know who they are.
Max! You taking me home? I can't. I got an early run tomorrow. My goodness, there isn't any breeze out here, either.
Listen to the wind. It scares me. My papa gave me those. I never take them off. Alva, listen...
80 per cent instruments, 20 per cent intuition. I agree with all Dr. Grant has just said. But I've always been fascinated by that phrase "Life as we know it". I have a feeling that we may encounter life as we don't know it. These strange formations seem to be all over the planet's surface.
Thanks, Father. Well, you made your decision, Mr. Tracy. Yes. I only hope it was the right one. Now that the boys are going to be at the launching of Zero X, the safety of the crew is assured, but... But what about the saboteurs?
- Gee! It's fabulous. - I thought you'd like it. No parking problem here, m'lady. Wow. What a terrific group. Yes. They always play at the Swinging Star.
I'm being serious. What you're planning is no joke. Stop teasing me! Go to the devil! I've helped you plan this, but you must be told the truth.
Is something wrong? - I feel so happy. Now, Prince Andrei no longer felt the same love for her as before. Something within him had changed. There was none of the former poetic charm of attraction, only a kind of pity for her feminine and childish weakness, a sort of terror before her devotion and trustfulness.
You see, Curt. They are host beings. They grow devices that enable them to control other creatures. Somehow the creatures they controlled on Venus became sterile and died out. Without controlled creatures, Zontar's dominant race, slowly withered away.
Nothing wrong at the installation, is there? It's gone! What's gone? The satellite, simply vanished! Wonderful, so what can we do about it?
Well, I've lost my job, haven't I? Mendel? Mendel. Trouble. No, it's these ants.
- What I believe is not the point, Dobbs. The point is, the Foreign Office believe the police. It's unfortunate that in this distressing matter we are now answerable to the two public bodies with whom our current relations are most, shall I say, uneasy. Lf, of course, there are facts not included in your confidential report which point to Fennan's suicide for reasons other than his interview with you, I shall be happy to hear about them. Are there?
Yes. - Do you love her? - Oh, Charles. I'm not a child. I know that real love doesn't just explode.
Dr Adams, please stand by. Explain. I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study that patient... You don't believe him and you can't explain it. Are you aware that in 20 years, Dr Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in 40 centuries?
- Stay with her, Doctor. Jim, darling, it is me. It is Ruth. Captain's log, stardate 3025.8. lnvestigation of this unusual planet continues.
The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured. By who? And why? And why these particular things?
Enjoy yourself, Captain. I believe you'll find the planet quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth. Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts or force fields. Only peace, sunshine and good air. You'll have no problems.
Can you give us any more? Our circuits are heating. We'll have to cease. Disengage. That knoll should have been sheared off.
Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me? The intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited. This is no surprise. His vessel was baited easily with a simulated message.
Steven... don't you think we were going? Not just yet Doc, we haven't had our little talk about brother Reuben. The late brother Reuben. Oh yes I know. Yes, sometimes after a bereavement it's very difficult to find exactly the right kind of words... The right words? Easy!
What's wrong? How was your man last night? Mine was dead drunk again. I don't know what to say! Men are all the same.
They've got no right to summon anybody for anything. How dare they! You won't forgive me. You'll never forgive me. What kind of tree is this?
Adelaide! Adelaide, we're going now! I didn't mean you. I meant the blowfly. - The blowfly?
If I were you, I'd stay away from the Whateleys. That was the original town square. 70 years ago, there was a big oak tree right there in the middle of the street. That's where the people of Dunwich lynched my great-grandfather. They just let him hang there for days and days and days and days.
That's where the people of Dunwich lynched my great-grandfather. They just let him hang there for days and days and days and days. Then they burned the tree down to the ground. Wilbur, stop it. It's just history.
It was about a man getting on in years, 35 or 40 years old, a diplomat, very austere, very stern, whose conduct is above all suspicion. This gentleman watches young girls playing tennis. Of course, as the days pass, he gets ideas. One day a tennis ball falls in his garden. He puts it in his pocket. And when the girls come, he pretends to look for it among the nettles.
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails. The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone. Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius? Did I not meet thy friends?
for these predictions are to the world in general as to Caesar. When beggars die, there are no comets seen. The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear.
You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? Judgment! hou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me.
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day. We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat.
They walk the streets or give themselves in taxis. Comfort's a thing of the past. I'm down to one girl. If i were a man, The thing is, the girls have to work in factories 10 hours a day.
This world isn't... made for me. It's not made for lonely people. Do you hear me? ! This world isn't made for lonely people.
I wanted to be an airline stewardess. The first time, they said they'd get back to me. Then a friend of mine said, "You're too tall." And I never heard from them. The next year, I got ill when they were having entry examinations.
But you shall not succeed. I shall speak only the truth. I hope so. Now you say your name is Melinda Tentrees? Would you tell the court what knowledge you have of the tragic voyage of the frigate Westerly.
They're attacking Japan. - What? - You missed an earlier confession. Who is going to fight? These peasants will kill us. Not if you write those reforms. There won't be any revolution.
Wonder whose violin this is. Just remember, we found it. We didn't steal it. Your quarters are up here. The king will see you this evening. - Holy, hey, you stole the king's violin.
Unity is strength. Let's stick together. They want to abolish horse-carts but they don't care for us. Attention please. In our country, many people are without work.
Can we shoot? If it's a bird and you shoot it, it becomes gold and falls. Good, We must be prepared and keep the gun with us. - Any news? - Cabbar scares me.
- 120 lira. - No. Take your gun and go. Don't hit me. I won't do it again.
I haven't told anyone. Not everything. I can't. Tell me! A cat comes and sits at the foot of my bed, staring.
Tell me! A cat comes and sits at the foot of my bed, staring. Then it reaches out towards me. And I try to scream. But my throat is strangled.
- It isn't true? - Yes. Maybe today, maybe in a week, maybe, maybe. - Olga, Olga, what's wrong with Olga? Stop pretending to be a smartass. Always reading smart shit.
Are you waiting for this to become revolutionary? What I mean is that we should close the univeristy, that's it, and nobody, nobody should get up our nose, and if they do, it will be at their own risk and danger and when they'll decide to reopen it, they will do it on our conditions But why stopping the poeple who want to go to the lessons? Why... Because they are against us, because they prevent us to get what we deserve we've tried everything: we've begged, negotiated, written programs, but we haven't got a damn.
- What does it mean? Perhaps it's nothing serious, but the people of my group have some rules about smoking, they're bound to reality What a bore! Let's look for some shade What does it mean "bound to reality"?
Sorry, but if it wasn't to join us, why did he come? Why? Who has the right to say if he wants to stay here or not? What kind of bullshit is that meetings aren't his forte, if he wants to be a revolutionary he has to stay with other people, otherwise... That's why he came here There is no revolutionary without other people, who was Lenin with no organisation, or Castro with no organisation, even anarchists spent their life in meetings, what the hell!
You're the last person I would have suspected, my... cultured friend. Search them. No, Sergeant. Let him keep it. You may write your last wishes.
Let him be, he's just a silly old bugger. Attention, the Austrians are here! Charge! Don't be silly, come and have a drink. "Where are the clowns of my childhood?
He was making other children laugh... but his own he made cry. As a white clown, I was his fraternal enemy, I tried to teach him with trick blows to the head, treading on his toes and rabbit blows to the neck. But Augusto, refusing my advice, carried on with his drunkenness, bringing on himself a rain of brakish watter and rotten eggs. He died smothered by an ostrich egg.
Just change the locks. I'm afraid it's not that simple, Cookie. I'll come back later. I was in agony. I've been raped before, but never in such an unnatural and brutal way.
Oh St Cecilia! I honor you with all my heart and soul, but at the same time I find it hard to bow down my head to you in prayer. My conscience is so immaculately clean that I fear I nitpick in trying to search my soul for any immoral acts I may have committed. I can only feel a sort of comradeship to all of you. I mean, yes, I realize you have lived entirely chaste lives But I myself have done practically the same thing since the days of my First Holy Communion.
I don't care if you throw a party for it. I wish I had a chance to call on all my friends and invite them over to watch. I wish I had a movie camera so that I could record every second of it so afterwards I just could sit and gaze at all my lovely work. Oh, and that cheesy little streetwalker! Neither one of them deserve an ounce more oxygen running their putrid little lungs.
And destroyed her. Just as they are ready to do any time free men anywhere Waver in their defense of democracy. Yes, once again, american defense proves its effectiveness Against international communism. Using this diagram of a tooth to represent any small country We can see how international communism works By eroding away from the inside. When one country or tooth falls victim To international communism, its neighbors soon follow. In dentistry, this is known as the "domino theory. "
Come on Xanthippe. You've bored everyone with your speeches and instead of mocking the claimed ignorance of the people you'd be better off looking at yourself. But look at you. Look at him, this flea-ridden animal. Now that Athens is beaten, you'll finally have the excuse to no longer go to the meetings and in this way you can earn the bread for your family. Talk for talk's sake, at least get paid by those who listen to you.
Yes, I do. In any case I don't fear death, better to die for Athens than to live in exile. If the Thebans hadn't welcomed us as they did, we wouldn't be here this evening. They could have captured us and handed us over to The Thirty Tyrants Who would have condemned us to death. You're right, I still don't understand why the Thebans first allied With the Spartans to defeat us and then gave us exile after the ruin.
A demon called Teute went to visit king Tamus to bring him up to date about the arts he had invented, and to invite him to let the Egyptians participate. He talked about numbering, calculation, geometry, astronomy, trick track and dice to finally arrive at writing. The practice of writing said the demon, will develop knowledge and strengthen the memory of your citizens. This is my most beautiful invention and it will lead you to science. Very good said the king, but can you create new arts Teute, I can foresee what will happen if it is practised I can therefore tell you that writing will give a result completely different from what you imagine.

In confiding in writing, men will no longer search for their memories deep down inside them, they will forget to trust their memories and in so doing will lose much of their knowledge,
The law demands me to speak to defend myself And I will do that. However, before replying to my accusers, who I listened to with the greatest attention, I must contest the gossips that for twenty years now have insisted in confusing me with a certain Socrates Who is busy analysing The mysteries of the earth, or, even worse, of venerating clouds. Such a person is just in the spirit of those who have maliciously put me on stage An atheist and Aristophanes or those who imitate him, do not at all hide the severity of the their accusations behind their prank.
No, it's impossible. Ah, finally You reply correctly. And so you admit that if I believe in the manifestations of a supernatural power, I implicitly believe in the existence of this power. Meletus's accusation is based only on defamation, this defamation can bring my death, but before you I will not behave like a coward. When at war our generals assigned me a post I remained firm, and if God gives me the task of reasoning, I will not desert.
What do you propose to mitigate your penalty? Athenians, I am not shocked by this result, I am rather surprised to be condemned by such a slight majority. As for the punishment, Meletus proposes death. In turn what penalty can I propose to you, what penalty to inflict on a man who has always sacrificed his personal ambition in the interests of his fellow citizens. To be just, he shouldn't be punished, on the contrary, grant him some reward and do it now as if we were dealing with anyone and not me, Socrates.
And your lives will be marked by the injustice that you have now committed. Neither this morning, when I presented myself before this court, nor, before, when I got onto this platform, nor at any moment of this trial, did the divine voice criticise my behaviour or my words. This is because all the events of this day were desired by the Gods. As for death, either it is truly eternal sleep, or the soul remains in an eternal house. Whatever it is, I have no fear. Before dying, I simply make this prayer.
And I shouldn't perhaps drink hemlock on the day after the arrival of the ship? You Socrates, accept death, but we have prepared your escape, you must escape, the prison guards won't oppose us. And where will I go? To Thessaly, I have friends down there expecting you. But in Thessaly, my dear Crito, like here, like all of us, I would be put to death.
Theodorus I offer you this thigh and this meat so that you can smell the aroma. Asclepius, fulfil His request. By offering a cock, a pigeon, a lamb, or any way something very small, in exchange for the protection and love of the gods, man asks for his desires to be satisfied. In other words: a lot. We even hope to be spared from death with a cock. There I can understand, Socrates. Death is horrible and certainly more painful than birth.
And the truth, like the stars, is very difficult to reach. From the plain and on mountain tops we look at the stars without the sensation of having gone near them. It's the same with the truth. You don't have to go close to see it. Do you want to get yourself condemned then?
now we'll see what Critias does, our new tyrant, he too was a pupil of Socrates. Be quiet, it's not prudent. Shouldn't you buy something else for your family to eat? Ah yes, you're right. Yes, I've been going round the city for two days and have completely forgotten that I left home to buy the bread, it's true that there was nothing to buy and the events, completely disturbed me.
Any luck? -Keep back. -What's that? -A bomb. A bomb!
-Look through the door. But be careful. DOCTOR: It's a volatiser. If that thing should fall... It'll explode and probably destroy this research centre completely.
- Did you? Would you like that swan as a souvenir of your vist? I wouldn't know what to do with it. Unless you filled it with apple strudle. I must say things are very much cheaper here than they are in London.
Let him also be an exception. The exception. Let the church stay, but let him and the Protestants build another church. Yes, give him quarter. Let one man escape that rule... and we'll all be dead by sundown. You all swore holy oaths to fight as a unit... and sell your skill to the winner, whatever their religion.
And the other side is just as rotten. I will tell you. All sides are rotten, except for people like you. Religious fanatics who incite murder... for the sake of a God they have never known. The world is, as it is, a fallen world.
Yes, but this time, we must bend the rule. Catholic or Protestant, it would make no difference. This time, we need the peasants to work. That church must be an exception. The exception.
This time, we need the peasants to work. That church must be an exception. The exception. But it stinks of Satan. It's the breeding place of evil.
But your tears, for whom did you shed them? There's still some time left. What? Once on the ship, you can't turn back You think I'm not aware of that?
You won't stay there, even if... Even if what? If Terumichi is alive, I will not need a return ticket Ritsuko, is this your definition of a life without regrets? What a horrible face you make!
What did they bury? A treasure? Who did they bury? My younger brother They buried a baby, who was still breathing
Pension day is the worst. Soon as they get it, they blow the lot... on milk, tea, sugar, a tin of meat for their cat. The whole crux of the problem, uh... lies in the basic dissatisfaction... of these senile delinquents with the world as they find it. They begin to question, uh, the values of their society. They see their sons and daughters growing up... to become accountants, uh, solicitors, sociologists even.
Hello Mrs. Teal. Now, Mrs. Teal, this is for $15... and is to stop us revealing the name of your lover in Bolton. So, Mrs. Teal, send us $15 by return of post, please... and your husband Trevor and your lovely children Diane, Janice and Juliet... need never know the name of your lover in Bolton. Now, a letter, a series of photographs... and a hotel registration book which could add up to divorce... premature retirement and possible criminal proceedings... for a company director in Bromsgrove. He's a Freemason and a conservative M.P.
Oswald Street... has presented us with a poser. We do not know which bush he is behind. But we can soon find out. Yes. It was the middle one. Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Hull... chose a very cunning way of not being seen.

Javais Brookhamster. He's in the wine trade... and his father uses him as a wastepaper basket. And finally, Oliver Singen Mollusk, another old Italian. His father was a cabinet minister and his mother won the derby. He's thought by many to be this year's outstanding twit.

It was obvious the joke was lethal. No one could read it and live. Scribbler's mother, alarmed by the unusual sounds of merriment... entered the room and found what was, apparently... a suicide note. The war against the Hun continues... and as Britain's brave boys battle against the Bosch... their leaders are on the lookout for new breakthroughs that could provide... the ultimate weapon in the war against the Hun. Here, in this little house in Pinchley, they think maybe they've found it.
Okay, let's get the Longene loot and we'll cut out. Kid, call Pop. Tell him to ring the Longenes. Hey, Pop, Buzz the Longenes. -They don't answer. -He says he doesn't get any answer.
Hey, Pop, Buzz the Longenes. -They don't answer. -He says he doesn't get any answer. -Pop. The log says they're in. -I don't get any answer.
Let's take a look at the rock at 100. I doubt that's what knocked the capsule off trajectory. Unless the rock was going at tremendous speed, or unless it's terribly heavy. For Pete's sake, Ruth, it can't be that heavy. Hall and I could lift the capsule. However, it's possible the rock is different in space:
Some day. But for now, he's quite all right. I don't want anyone poking in here or lurking in the halls. There's lots of mending to be done. Pay no attention to them, Amy. Did the ant kill the caterpillar?
Prick? I could very easily get serious about this girl. She's a lot of fun to be with. This is just between the two of us, but for the last year or so, I've been having... I don't know, a little trouble. I wasn't worried, but still and all... a little trouble with... well, myself. You know... getting hard.
I'm not sure I agree. - With what? - With what you said. No, I don't either. You don't agree with what you said? How do you feel about it?
- With what you said. No, I don't either. You don't agree with what you said? How do you feel about it? I think people only like to think they're putting on an act, but it's not an act, it's really them.
No, I don't either. You don't agree with what you said? How do you feel about it? I think people only like to think they're putting on an act, but it's not an act, it's really them. If they think it's an act, they feel better, because they think they can always change it.
What is it, Mr. Weisenborn? Will you come in here a minute, please? Certainly, Mr. Weisenborn. Why, Mr. Weisenborn! Bobbie: Most guys I know are pricks.
Why, Mr. Weisenborn! Bobbie: Most guys I know are pricks. I don't know anymore what they want. Jonathan: I'll be happy to tell you. They want... the boodle.
They're crazy those guys, leave them alone, don't get involved Lulu', it's money, it all starts from there... We're all part of the same circle, owners and slaves, of the same circle, money. We become mad cause we have too little, and they become mad cause they have too many And so, in this hell, on this planet full of hospitals, asylums, cemeteries, factories, barracks and buses, the brain slowly slowly... runs away
Er... - So this is a television studio? - Yes. - Quite a place. - A barn, really. - Not as glamorous as you expected, I bet.
You taught me love last night. Your kisses made me dizzy... I still hold you. I can live without eyes or legs... I can live without you. I no Iongerfear life without you.
After reflection... I propose the following. Out of respect for their mothers... MurieI and Claude will separate for a year. During that year they'II take care of themselves... conscientiousIy. They'II neither see norwrite each other. What we ask of them is a sacrifice. But if, after a year... they wish to marry... or resume theirfriendship... neither mother, not Claude's nor MurieI's, will stand in theirway. - claude's mother knew a Iot could happen in a year.
Two little girls caressed all night... one knowing, one docile. She taught me to touch certain parts of my body... one especially. She convinced me... not to talk about our secret. After she left, I sometimes did it alone. I didn't understand that part of me.
When you've studied it, come back and I shall question you. Thank mun, . Mun. I'm not surprised that Angela Merici's book of sanctimonious claptrap confused you. Most religions believe that by crying "Lord! Lord!"
The exorcisms have failed. We must resort to other measures. Did you sleep well'? With all this noise? There are thousands out there, where would you expect them to get the beds from'?
By the authority of our late Governor, Sainte Marthe. Assuring me full powers until such time as a new election is held. Here! His Majesty's proclamation has been delayed. The matter of a few days, a mere formality.
So it's up to us to work together for a better town, And a better future. All this politicking's gonna ruin my business. Now, I guess I've got to make something very clear. And that is that I'm in Tombstone to stay. I think all of us here want to stay. I think we all want the town to have a future.
- Later. Hm. What does that poor skinny tailor want with Tzeitel? They've been friends since they were babies. They play... - They play?
For your sake. Thank you. It's no crime to be poor. It is the rich who are the criminals. Some day, their wealth will be ours. That would be nice.
May God bless and keep the Tzar... far away from us. Then there are the others in our village. They make a much bigger circle. We don't bother them and, so far, they don't bother us. And among ourselves, we always get along perfectly well.
There's nothing we can do. We need her collaboration. -And so? -Normal. Those cataleptic seizures was caused by emotional shocks.
I want my grandchildren. And I've a few things to say to the people on the telly concerning themselves and the lies of Tobias Cromwell and the insinuation that I am not the only Mary Magdalene St. Bridget O'Flaherty in County Galway! DERVAL: I'm hungry. FINN: We're runaways.
We just found him on the road. And you just found yourself on his back too, ey? My little brother was tired, so we rode. To sell him at the next town. We'd have left him in a field, the same way we found him.
Da, what are you doing? Keep out. I've just made £400. And I've rung the police. Da, you wouldn't sell a couple of poor kids for money?
So it came onto land after it changed like a frog does. That may be the case... but is it possible for a living organism to be made up of minerals? You're sure you saw sparks coming from it? Yes, without a doubt. It was very beautiful.
The colored, gooey stuff is waste material. The white, shiny stuff is the crystallized carbon. It's a mineral I think we should call hedrium. What you see there is the eyeball of the tadpole ground into powder. Hedrium is as good a name as any I can think off... but I think the white substance is the key to the lifeforce of the monster.

Hedrium is as good a name as any I can think off... but I think the white substance is the key to the lifeforce of the monster. If its body is formed by minerals and waste material... it wouldn't have a nerve structure as we know it.
Papa, if Hedorah isn't from this planet, then how did it get here? Ken, do you know what a meteor is? "A shooting star that falls to earth." That's right. Hedorah must have been on a rock that landed on earth.
State your business and be on your way. I can state that in one word. David. David? What's he to you?
I do. If your king must bend to the law and not be above it, you owe that to me, too, not to Highland savages like the Stewarts. I've seen Campbells as savage as Stewarts. Aye, but they're savages on the right side, and the Stewarts are savages on the wrong. I'm a Highlander myself, Mr. Balfour.
Promise me? I'm confused, Mr. Stewart. I don't know what to think. I came to Edinburgh to tell what I saw, and I find myself threatened on all sides with the dire consequences of telling it. I won't say I'm not afraid, because I am.
But I certainly don't. Just asking. He said I didn't have to. Wouldn't do any good, he said. He said, "Cows don't drink milk, do they?" I don't quite understand.
Thanks for putting up that fence for a playpen... but I've got everything worked out through Dr. Caudillo... and these people he's known for a real long time. They've been waiting ages on all kinds of lists and things. They're going to take the baby, right away, so I won't get used to it or anything. They're older people, but they're perfectly lovely, Dr. Caudillo says. Pretty well fixed.
The kind of customers we got didn't appreciate it. I've got half a notion to take up where my parents left off. Daddy's brakes gave out on the ridge route. It was a four-car collision, written up in the paper. Wonder why I don't remember the funeral.
I should have done that. But I didn't want you to worry. I was pretty busy with one thing and... We didn't even know where to start looking for you. Do you know the Bureau of Missing Persons... isn't even listed in the phone book?
It means nothing to you, but I've got a reputation in this town-- What's Presbyterian Church to you? You just got to sell out! Just sell out and go someplace where people are civilized. They'll get you, McCabe.
Good evening, Mr. Elliott. Hi, Freddie. Going to the opera? Mr. Smalley, you want to sit in on a hand? I don't gamble with no professionals. The church is coming along nicely, isn't it?
Pushing pills. Bobby's playing king of the mountain, and you're pushing pills to kids. You ever been in a house of detention, Helen? Heard about it? Seen it? It's like a zoo.
Dr. Moore! When addressing a judge, please rise! Understood, Dr. Moore? You know or should know that the criminal records only mean something after pronouncing the sentence. I ran towards the window, the one facing Pearl Street. I saw a dark car on the street, driving very fast.
Hey here is the guy who always fakes his death! This time he's faking it perfectly. What can we do? Nothing. A sheep is not a wolf.
Go ahead. - Keen eye. - Killed 50, they say. Exaggeration. 32, to be exact. Suppose you spread your cards on the table, gentlemen. And the cash.
- No. Erica Enright, Bonnie Marcus, Jessica Harper. You should see the girls in the bathroom. They're all throwing up.
I need my body to live. - Yes, now... No tell me, tell me! I owe my body this respect and protection. Roll down your eyes then open them.
I may get sick! This is going too far! Tell that little guy to turn us around! Now I am going to be sick! There's no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going
Does that mean, I have to agree... with every foolish idea you have? How dare you! Allow me, please. I think you've seen these  <hon>notes<hoff> before. No. I think I'd better hold them. How come you have those things?
- Not so much as you think. Where are the packages? Vanished. And it's your fault! - That vanishing act is your specialty.
I never heard such music in all my born days. I mean, it just fair sets my spine a-tingle. But you know something, Doctor? There is one thing that's plumb confusing to my mind. What's that?
There are varying degrees of risk in all surgery, Mrs. Call. Ma'am, there ain't nothing to worry about. Betwixt him and me taking care of you, why, there ain't nothing can go wrong. You can't go with me, Tammy. You've got to stay here and keep up your schooling.
Well, we shall see. Come with me to the stable, Stefan. I wish to attend to my horse. Wait, Lieutenant. That's what I came to tell you. Your  <hon>horse<hoff> is gone.
In that case, i'll call major giles and tell him you have my permission. I think he should be there to explain things. Heh heh. He'll have to be there. I slept on it. And you were right about  <hon>secrets<hoff> seeming less effective when they're out in the open.
By themselves, none of them amount to a thing. But put together, they give me the strangest feeling. Well, what kind of things? For one thing,  <hon>Bill<hoff> has always been vitally interested in my research. He used to mention it.
A man of honor died last week. A decent, courageous fighter for the cause of freedom gave his life. He gave his life for us! Some skulking...  <hon>assassin<hoff> murdered him! But friends, and neighbors, and co-fighters nick bloss did not die in vain.
I'II get you your proof, darling. I'm going to call in a genealogist. -We'II get his Professor Simms. -He can trace our family tree. Trace it?
Do them now, Tish. -Oh, darling. -please. Very well. Now the bullfrog, Tish.
Well I suppose everything's alright. See the temperature there is perfectly...it's quite safe to go outside. Oh Susan, just turn on the scanner a minute, let's try and see where we are. Doctor! Perhaps you need a new  <hon>tube<hoff> Doctor?
I'm sorry, Barbara. Is it selfish to want us all to stay together? No, of course not! We ought to be able to hear something. It's ridiculous!
Yes, well, it's all crumbling. We're going to need help to shift this. Yes, it will be difficult, but remember we're in London. - What's that got to do with it? -  <hon>People<hoff> will be curious. They'll want to know why we're trying to break into a police box.
- I'm impressed. His total time for the eight tests was six minutes, three seconds. You took two hours, eight minutes, and you beat me. I said I was impressed. What about his  <hon>parents<hoff>?
We can clear the whole thing up tomorrow. He wants to take us to a safer place. Really, Colin. Save this sort of thing for Istanbul. We're not the only ones to feel that you academics... have stumbled onto something that requires our kind of attention. Three of the embassies you called at yesterday... are flying in special planes... to take their own newly-discovered assets back home.
Paul, you've terrified people. They've been terrified. They've been hunted, like some kind of freak vermin.  <hon>People<hoff> believe that you're not human. I don't know what that means, but you must learn not to kill.
But they kill. I know we kill... but it's wrong, and you're different. For your own sake, you must not kill. They tried not to kill. I believe that.
He died at Tobruk. The rest of the lot there are cousins. There's two of them still living. I must say the family's been thinned out nicely one way or another. Charlie, before we go out to my mum, I must tell you... she's a bit mad.
That's what it amounts to. If I can't book a flight, I'll catch an afternoon train. It's a hell of a D-day, that's all I can say. To be honest with you, there's something very unpleasant... about this little deceit you're pulling on the Navy. You've been cackling away all afternoon as if the invasion... in which the fate of nations and the lives of millions are at stake... is nothing more to you than a private joke.
You featherheads in London, all you want to do is make movies. Who's running this featherheaded war? Ginger Rogers? The demolition units are halfway across the English Channel. The invasion started two hours ago.
Hitler ruled the sky. He had the greatest army in the world. But he couldn't make it across 30 miles of English Channel. Right. Hitler had everything, except a navy. Now he's finished. This  <hon>planet<hoff> is five-sixths water!
Probably a badly closed shutter. Thank you. I didn't hear anything. I was woken up by the songbirds. The builder is here. For  <hon>the bathroom wall.<hoff>
Go on sit on there, that's a good girl. Go on, get on there. I'm freezing, get the fire going. There'll be no wood in this house. In the middle of the forest?
They've already done that. I'll see them when I'm ready, that's my job. They wish respectfully Sire, to call your attention to the fact that they have been waiting for three days. Let them wait; that's their job.  <hon>Ambassadors<hoff> are paid to pace about in anterooms especially in these times of uneasy peace.
I'll see them when I'm ready, that's my job. They wish respectfully Sire, to call your attention to the fact that they have been waiting for three days. Let them wait; that's their job. Ambassadors are paid to pace about in anterooms especially in these times of uneasy peace. But they have an urgent communication from Henry of England, Sire.
I'm an idiot then, talk to me like an idiot. Will you lift the excommunication you pronounced on Lord Gilbert? No, because it's the only weapon I have left to defend what was given into my care. Will you agree to the ten proposals which the Bishop's accepted in your absence, particularly, to the surrender of priests who seek the protection of the church to escape my courts of justice? No.
Yes, Sire. There's nothing more certain to win them over than the sight of a king doing penance and humbling himself under the lash. The honor of God, gentlemen, is a very good thing and all things considered one gains by having it on one's side. Thomas Becket our friend, always used to say so. Tonight in council, we will determine what punishment his  <hon>murderers<hoff> should receive.
The Bishop is waiting. As if it mattered what I do with a Bishop whose city I've just taken. It matters. Am I the strongest, or am I not? You are today, but one must never drive one's enemy to despair, it makes him strong gentleness is better politics, it saps virility.
Business, My Lord. All right, business. Sit down. Listen carefully, Marie, to the droppings of the greatest brain of our day. Now piecing together all the information
I wouldn't say so. If you interviewed female factory workers, their answers would be very similar to mine. In no way can it be denied that female factory workers have relationships with their workmates, they go out with them, or with other men, they enjoy such sexual and sentimental freedom and lack of inhibition, unheard of just a few years back. In Milan, Fallaci, in Milan. But what about the lumpenproletariat in Calabria, for example? That's a different planet. Are  <hon>women<hoff> freer now, or were they freer in your time?
Are  <hon>women<hoff> freer now, or were they freer in your time? What? Are they freer now? Yes. They are more refined, nicer. - They are nicer? - Yes. Not as coarse.
What was that? They weren't even allowed to speak to women? Back then, no, you couldn't talk to a girl, because people imagined things, especially in these small towns. Today's different, things are more relaxed, more casual. Now 13-year-old  <hon>girls<hoff> can go out to the cinema. - Things have changed. - On their own?
If there are grave problems, do you think divorce is the right thing? I think so, because you get fed up of being bound to the same man. - Is divorce right? - Not for me. - Why? - Not for me.
But the boys are always commenting. - Are you afraid of their comments? - No, but there is always... Then why? When I go to Milan, or Bologna, or Rome, and talk to a boy, the girls immediately come and talk, too. - But here, nothing. - She meant that when the place is small...
- And that's it. - It's all over. - Do you find divorce is necessary? - Yes. In some cases, definitely. - You think divorce should be legal in Italy? - Yes.
- It's all... There is a reason. You, little one. Would you like to go out for coffee by yourself, when you're older? - Yes. And tell me, why do men here in Calabria demand you be reserved and serious, so unlike them? Maybe it's because they're a bit jealous.
- What do you think, you don't want to talk? Why not? - She's shy. How are t <hon>he men of Naples<hoff>? Are they nice?
How are  <hon>the men of Naples<hoff>? Are they nice? Very nice, but they don't want to pay. - Don't want to pay? - They don't want to pay the money.
But, no sooner back on shore... there! All right for one mystery, but not two! Who was singing? The beach was deserted. But the voice was there... Now near.
Sold already to that worker of mine for small change. I buy and sell fast! What are you doing? I'm freezing to death! Will you help me?
What scream? I don't know, someone was screaming before. What scream?  <hon>The ship<hoff> wasn't here yet! What do you mean it wasn't here? It arrived when you were taking care of the fireplace.
- Why is it doing that? - I don't know. Watch out. Why is that smoke yellow? Because it's poisonous.
Smiler. Run and fetch Sir Basil and bring him to the square. Tell him we've a couple of Spaniards for him. Go on. Come on. Here's  <hon>the two Spaniards<hoff>, Sir Basil.
-Yes, sir. What about the craftsmen we need for the repairs? -Shall I get them ready? -Just do as I tell you, mister. Exuberant bunch of  <hon>lads<hoff>, captain.
Your carpenters, laborers, sailmakers, smiths. They'll be ready to work on the Diablo in the morning. Diablo? That means "the devil," doesn't it? The  <hon>villagers<hoff> all have their living to make.
- Really nothing? I Don't care. Absolute madness. - There's a lot of vulgarity and violence in this world and instead they are so kind. Here's the Countess Crosara.
How oddly this martian smells. Everybody sit down around here, just listen carefully to what your mother is telling you. Everybody is talking about these martians, everybody is looking for them, but nodoby saw them... only your mother could catch and keep safe one martian, ok? And what to do now that he has been kept safe? What to do?
- Are we going to criticize him too? - Don Giuseppe, here's a bottle of wine. - Thank you. - Drink it to our health. This is a gift I'm enjoying wholeheartedly.
Here we come to this wonderful area of Veneto's countryside for our TV program and after the exceptional events occurred a night ago just to approach and hear about what happened live from witnesses' voices... Here we are, let's stop for a while. Madam? Madam, please where did martians land? Everywhere, in the middle of fields... a stink...
Twenty-eight days in the glass house they gave him which was something to shout about in those days. Wonderful station, Singapore. What was your favorite station, Muscles? The best station I ever knew was Malta before the war. The navy used to go on fleet maneuvers and leave their  <hon>wives<hoff> behind all soft and pink, and willing.
Who taught them to shoot? You. If it wasn't for people like us, you couldn't walk around spouting your smarmy silly bloody half-baked ideas! That remark, sergeant major, may well cost you your rank. Stay with her, Muscles, till she quietens down. See she doesn't leave the mess. What a right old cow. No wonder the  <hon>officers<hoff> dumped her onto us.
When you were in England, you were so different. Yes. I was one of your African mascots then, wasn't I? Sitting at your feet, listening to you talk. My God, how you talked. No one talks better than the  <hon>British<hoff>. They drug you with talk.
Come on! Say, what kind of party is this anyway? My friend will explain the whole thing to you. What are you so worried about? Well, the last time I took a job like this was July 4th.
Didn't Barney tell you? He didn't tell me to expect anything like this. I'm getting out of here. Now just a second. You know, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Only the president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce... but you let Gladys Bukitsch grab him off. Gladys Bukitsch. Four foot six, bad complexion, pigeon-toed. I could cry. You know what he did for her  <hon>folks<hoff>? Bought them a house in Del Webb's Sun City.
It may be a little tight, but that can't hurt any. Oops. What's the matter now? I lost my  <hon>navel<hoff>. Where?
- Good morning, Mr Bush. I wanted to ask you the best way to catch northern pike. Well, sir, uh... Joe. I'll be with you in just a minute. Why don't you let Joe show you the new nylon lines that came in?
- A phoney. - I don't like that word. - But it's true, isn't it? No. But if  <hon>customers<hoff> learned the truth I'd lose them, I'd lose my job. Cadwalader would have me thrown out.
- I don't like that word. - But it's true, isn't it? No. But if  <hon>customers<hoff> learned the truth I'd lose them, I'd lose my job. Cadwalader would have me thrown out. And if I entered, they'd know.
Yeah! No smoking, no drinking and, above all, no pain-in-the-ass women! And that final act... Right! The Maniacs ADVICE Do you want me to hit the sidewalk?
The Duce! Hail! Hail! Hail! These  <hon>Americans<hoff>!
The little babe from Focette. Great! Sure, we'll sort out the goods for Focette on the steamer at Gorgona. I'll call you back, sir. Yes, sir?
That's what's needed. Then it's just a question of time, you'll make it too... - You really think so? - Yes! Just remember what I've taught you. The pen has to be aggressive.
Long live Ciociaria! - But I say, are we...? - Shh! But I say, are we sure  <hon>this job<hoff> will go well for us? Absolutely. I've been casing it for months.
Get moving, there. Quickly, get along. Come on. Hurry up! Couriers, you are to go to  <hon>my intended guests.<hoff>.. to the Duke of Verga, to Verona, Florence... tell them that they are to come here... to my castle without delay...
A letter for me? What was in the letter? He said he was sorry not to be here to meet you... but he'll try and get down one day next week. He sent me some  <hon>flowers<hoff>. - You saw them, didn't you?
- What? These  <hon>cigarettes<hoff>. They're mentholated. You don't usually smoke these. - No, I don't.
- Please, Mrs. Gibbs. I'm very fond of Janet. She's fond of you, too. She told me last time she was home. I'm sorry, miss. I thought you knew about  <hon>her mother and father.<hoff>
No... Come down here and I'll show you! Sunder! What are you doing? !
How can I ? My fate is to be decided today "Then, hear me out ! I don't like you." Have you ever seen your face ? I see it now. ln your eyes.
Radha ? "Oh, well ..." - Why? Don't you like her ? How does that matter ?
I'm too busy. Come here, you'll be much more comfortable. One for the road. One never knows. Life is wonderful!
- howto take care of men. - Really? They get a diploma? All I know is that it's a recognized profession such as typist or social worker. Believe me, I just came back from the Olympic Games.
You can come in this way. You don't like it? I like it. As long as people like me. Why did you say "good" when I said I wasn't by myself?
You don't like it? I like it. As long as people like me. Why did you say "good" when I said I wasn't by myself? Usually  <hon>people<hoff> come here with company, but sometimes they're alone.
It's difficult to believe that people are good. I'm perfecting an electric guitar with a portable battery for serenading. But who does that today? Today a fiancé sends a record. And does anyone care for making death decorous?
-l was running too. -They ran. To the garden. -And the gun? -Did I have that?
-They ran. To the garden. -And the gun? -Did I have that? There was a  <hon>gun<hoff>, but it was on the ground.
- What does that prove? When I broke it open, I found Miguel where you see him... and Maria with a gun in her hand. - With a gun in her hand? - Still smoking. Did you have the gun in your hand?
By people who are out of their minds with fear! Maybe, but there are too many to be just coincidental. Stories about people who have died, and have come back. They're stories, Ben, stories. And why are  <hon>the infected people<hoff> always so tired in the daytime?
All right. Card tricks. Is it possible this germ, or virus, could be airborne? Anything is possible, Virge. The best brains in the world have been running through this thing... with a fine-toothed comb.
Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Therefore I tell you, do not worry about everyday life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
And he who doesn't gather with me, scatters. There is pardon for all the other sins and blasphemies of men, but not for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Master, may we see a sign from you? Wicked and unfaithful generation, the only sign that will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah. Jonah was three days and nights in the belly of the sea-beast. The Son of Man will be three days and nights in the earth.
His blood is upon us, and upon our children! Hail, King of the Jews! You will be ever hearing, but never understanding. You will be ever seeing, but never perceiving. The heart of this people has become dull.
I have come to bring them to perfection. You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its flavour, how can it be made salty again? It's no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain top cannot be hidden.
Wicked and unfaithful generation, the only sign that will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah. Jonah was three days and nights in the belly of the sea-beast. The Son of Man will be three days and nights in the earth. The men of Nineveh will condemn this generation on judgement day for they did penance to Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the south will condemn this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. Your mother and your brothers are outside, they want to speak to you.
Already... i feel a sense of... loss. My life had been space. It had been missions, projects and expeditions. There had been no time for intrusions that took the form of a woman's face, a voice, a short month of a man and a woman drawing together, becoming a part of one another, reaching tentatively into that strange and mysterious pond of love and then watching the ripples that came from it.
This is the sun and here is the earth, jupiter, venus, pluto, mars. And what do we know about our neighbors, commander? Mars is a vast, scrubby desert with an unbreatheable atmosphere. Pluto is poisonous and extremely cold. The moon is barren, jupiter, volcanic.
Some nut's got his radio on as high as it'll go. It seems to me like it's coming from the cassidys'. Hey... hey, you over there.  <hon>People<hoff> are trying to sleep. Look, pipe down, will you?
Uh, nobody there. What was that light i saw? Well, it was the car itself. A faulty connection or something. The lights kept going on and off by themselves. A  <hon>car<hoff> shouldn't act like that.
Look, I've had nothing to eat and I'm very thirsty. It is of no consequence. But I wrote the letter! But surely you didn't think you would be released? all  <hon>human creatures<hoff> are naïve.

If I can. The Doctor and Ian are missing, have you any idea where they are? Well please, tell me. There is a quality in human beings which intrigues me, your concern for each other. I assure you the two  <hon>men<hoff> are safe.
The Doctor and Ian are missing, have you any idea where they are? Well please, tell me. There is a quality in human beings which intrigues me, your concern for each other. I assure you the two  <hon>men<hoff> are safe. You know where they are?
Are there any other buildings in vicinity? None. Except the disintegrator room. Where's that? Below the courtyard, it is rarely used now. I cannot allow this mystery, but I can see that it worries you.
Where's that? Below the courtyard, it is rarely used now. I cannot allow this mystery, but I can see that it worries you. As to your other friends I must tell you, they have gone down into the aqueduct. What?
Are you sure? Yes! Look, this came away in the struggle. It looks like a shoulder flash. I-N-E-E-R. Yes, just as I suspected! It must be one of those  <hon>survivors<hoff> from that spaceship that exploded.
You might pass on my congratulations to the men, number One. Thank you very much sir. Shall we move then? They are coming. You will take up your position just by the entrance there.
I have never liked weapons at any time, however they're handy little things. Tell me, how long does this paralysis last? One hour. Fine, fine. Well these  <hon>weapons<hoff> are splendid, sir.
I was just about to do that. I myself could not sleep. Oh, dear, what a pity. That  <hon>stone<hoff> must be replaced. Somebody must have moved it or a reason.
-Besides, it's the part of it that's safe. -Yes. The scanner. I wonder.... We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.... Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again, I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you see outside, understand?
We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.... Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again, I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you see outside, understand? I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know. Won't know what? We have five minutes only.
Doctor... -I thought it only moved when the power was on. -Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column. -Well, what made it move? -The source of power.
It hadn't released itself. But why didn't the fault locator tell us? Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore, the fault locator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you a demonstration. Now, look, when I put my thumb on there, the  <hon>light<hoff> comes on.
Oh, I don't care about that now. The only thing that matters is getting Barbara out of there. Yes, I agree. Here, Sabetha, you better take this. Keep it with the other and keep it safe. Thank you.
-This whole place is one big booby trap. It's full of things like that statue. I'd only been here a minute when part of the wall crashed down just where I'd been standing. Oh, we'll take it very slowly. That doorway looks a good place to start.
- Yes. Yes, we are. Barbara, I think we should move on. Dogs will get you. Dogs in the forest. Savage beasts.
Very well. Speak! Well, it would be better if I spoke to someone in charge. That is impossible. Tell me your  <hon>story<hoff>.
The body was searched, it wasn't there. Then would you mind telling us what happened after the alarm bell went, please? Well, the relief guard was the first to reach the outside of the door. He was joined almost immediately by the controller and a guardian who was on patrol outside. And when I reached the door, it was opened and, well, you know what we found inside.
Oh, there's nothing much here... Pretty ordinary collection of things: - Oxygen, hydrogen, sodium... - Oh what's that? Oh, it's a spectrograph Susan.
How else am I supposed to keep these  <hon>creatures<hoff> off? Well do you need to keep them off? Have they actually attacked you? Come on John, lock the door. It can't open now.
No, not unless they return what they stole from my ship. But will they'll never give it back to you! Oh my dear, they're not invincible, no-no-no. Did any of you notice the peculiarity in their eyes? No I can't say I did.
It's a fallacy of course that cats can see in the dark, they can't; but they can see better than we humans because the iris of their eyes dilates at night. Yes... What are you driving at Doctor? Oh, it's all perfectly simple Chesterton, you see the Sensorites  <hon>eyes<hoff> are the exact opposite to that of a cats. The Sensorites eyes were completely dilated, that is enormous in light.
And you must throw off these suspicions. They're based on fear, and fear breeds hatred... and war. I shall speak to them peacefully. They'll see that I'm unarmed. There's no better argument against war than that.
I said to myself this was a way to get out into the world. You're a good lad, join up and don't go mad. Republic needs you... So how could you possibly like such a song? Not this particular one... I watched some songs from the front here, and I wasn't taken by the fact you composed them based on  <hon>melodies<hoff> of old established ones whether I was reading through or watched it,
When I lived at Jessy's, I didn't think she was like that. I thought she loved Pierre, an airline pilot. But not at all, she didn't give a damn. And then this guy from Texas showed up...  <hon>Women<hoff> can't resist an oil well.
- It's impossible. I know a girl at Pan Am. We're going to try. This isn't just a ruse to make you come? You don't know him.
But... - No buts, Darrin. It's only rough if you let it get rough. Louise just had a baby, remember? So I've been through this diaper derby.
- Thank you, Henry. Darrin, I've been worried about you. I'm sorry, Sam. I meant to call. I don't know where the time went. How did you know where I was?
- Goodbye, Kimmie. Thanks. Darrin, what happened? That kid hit me. Got me a pretty good shot too. - It's just a little  <hon>newspaper<hoff>.
The boat doesn't even float. Of course. That's it. It's not the campaigns that were wrong. It's the toys themselves.
Yeah, sure. Vegetable punch, fruit juice, cough medicine. That's the trouble with you boozers, you can't face up to reality. You live in a dream world. You see everything through an alcoholic haze.
It seems she doesn't like my  <hon>jam<hoff>. Oh, I'm sure she does. Well, I like the jar. And I think the label is very attractive. But when you open it, it's a matter of taste, isn't it?
No, I'm just a traveller. I lost my way and saw the light. At least the god Apollo to walk invisible past sentries.  <hon>Sentries<hoff>? I saw no sentries. Oh?
Well all's one - they will whiten well enough in the sun! Run, Achilles! Run a little more, before you die! What sort of people are they, Doctor? Oh, I'm not sure, my child.
I must brave even the wrath of Zeus, and implore you to remain. Well, I don't see why I should. I have many other commitments, you must understand... And one of them lies here. In the camp of Agamemnon, our general. Oh, hear me out, I pray!
Yes...broken in two. Can you see on the side! A flag! It's from home! Yes! You know it must have crashed. Yes, although you see those buildings?
People? A warlike people! They wanted to pillage the ship! I could not save them from my people as I do Bennett and yourself. They're walled up in a cave.
Oh, it certainly wasn't friendly to us! Must have kept Barbara, that... that scream! Barbara! Oh don't for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find another way out.
Must have kept Barbara, that... that scream! Barbara! Oh don't for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find another way out. This  <hon>thing<hoff>, was it armed?

Oh, I wonder. Thanks. Sorry about that, Doc. -We thought you were dead. -Well, I nearly was.
But you went ahead anyway. Making a decision like that, would scare anyone. But we had to know. Well, jow about taking a peak into the future? Come on. Niquel, molybdenum, manganese, iron. And not all are already melted down.
This photograph taken at the deepest point. Can I see the negative? Is it moving? Along the Masato Trench. How fast? At about 3 miles per hour.
Exactly, that was my deduction. That's why our explosion was greater than we expected. That's why it cracked the crust. Our problem is to harness the same source of energy to stop it. With that energy we could blow a hole big enough to take the pressure off! Not only take the pressure off, but if we could find a spot in the path of the crack with sufficiant hydrogen and set off an explosion there, we could stop it cold.

it is not like us. It makes the meal and it is put at bouquiner. 50 dollars for three idiotic books. There is not even only one image! It forgets what the money costs me. It waits until I die.
It will never denounce a woman of less than 50 years. Its trick, they is the women. It is the base of plan which one will apply. Billie, supervises this charming girl. Of calms, cherished,  <hon>it<hoff> will not arrive to you nothing.
But only for the Seine. We'll have it lifted. No ban will keep us apart anymore. Christiane... Tell me about the streets, the people...
Your father was up for selling it... No woman could ever stay here. It's too far away from anything! Your poor mother couldn't take it. Even the dog left.
- You will get a receipt. - Love letters. - Please, sir, they are my wife's. Tell it to the Sergeant Major. Those  <hon>letters<hoff>, sir.
Huh? Oh yeah. With these four walls surrounding you every day, I bet it starts feeling like a prison. A peaceful prison. Hey, do you know about this?
You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It just aches a bit, that's all. You know, before this, everybody had it made but me. Closest I ever got was to read it out of magazines.
Get rid of them. Bury them. Tex. You've gotta watch this because if Stevens don't come, you'll have to do it. Now, the injection's gotta be intravenous. First you find  <hon>the vein<hoff>.
Behold the lovely Falls of Xanadu. - An exact replica of those in the fam... - I can't swim. Help! Dear Guru Brahmin, you may remember that I wrote to you about my feelings towards the head of my department. "But now, I've met another man, and he's written a lot of poems to me.
- That wasn't the Dusty Acres, was it? - It was indeed. About to undergo a major operation on his image. So, to continue, the climate here suits me admirably the  <hon>people<hoff> here are so kind and generous. They talk entirely for their own pleasure.
Mama little Joyboy Want lobster, lobster Mama's little Joyboy Want lobster for Mom And then the whole dream changes. I don't know, it... It becomes like a nightmare.
It becomes like a nightmare. Because when I put that big darn platter of juicy lobsters down in front of Mom they're still alive, as if I haven't cooked them at all. Then, suddenly, I'd start to cry because I feel that I've let Mom down again. "That's all right," she says. "I'll take them the way they are." By golly, she tears right into those live lobsters, claws and all.

- Isn't it enchanting? - Yes. - It's absolutely breathtaking. - It's like another world. You know, some  <hon>people<hoff> think of death as a negative thing.
- Right, Harry. Connect the umbilical. All systems go. Ready for countdown. Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust air to air.
After 27 flights of stairs, we may wind up being old friends. We better get started. I don't trust this light. I think the entire building's gone mad. Everyone's running around trying to rescind the ten commandments.
We don't want you to miss any of the action here. Well, I guess that's it. Well, as we just heard in the match, the winner, in one qual, is Lord Percy. Say, fans, I'd like to remind you again about the wrestling card for next week. Last week, you'll recall, I promised to announce that card.
How long have you been together with these men? We started to talk during the camouflage. And then I saw you jam the whistle... and realised you also were in the fight against Hitler. I see I am surrounded by patriots. Not these others.
- That wasn't cos I was scared. - Why then? - I wanted to tell someone. There's no one down there, except Aunt Pen, and she doesn't believe me. - You must be scared. - Dr Beamaster says  <hon>scares<hoff> are in your head.
Well, she can't help you, she's dead. She was pregnant. Aye. Not much chance of looking after the child. She couldn't bear the thought of bringing up an illegitimate baby the way she was. Better to get rid of it.
The cabinet. Since he'd worked on the cabinet, he spotted it right away. From that day on, he couldn't work anymore. Pity, because... there was something he had to do. There was this crazy  <hon>idea<hoff>.
How do you know? I could do things that would amaze you. - I may come with you. - I'd like to be amazed. Salmo Salar Fluviasticis - a very rare kind of salmon.
Money was scarce. Not everyone could afford a coffin to send the dead away by rail. I'd put the corpse in my cab, pull his hat down and go. If I met a police patrol, I'd say:, Shush"... , Don't wake the comrade, he's tired out - conferences"... How could you drive with this  <hon>leg<hoff>?
Go on in, Doc. Over here. Out. One of them's wounded. I want you men to go home.
The Ridders got their mother an angel with her finger pointing up. _ At who? _ Nobody! _ All right, then, an angel. _ Does it have to be an angel?
What makes you think she is here? She gave this hostel as her address in a business transaction. When? About two years ago. Names mean nothing here, Watson!
We'll swing her round. And anyway, strictly speaking, I'm still on duty. It isn't too windy for you to fly. Come on. Give a hand. Oh, Richard, look at that bird.
Look at this. An underwater hatch. Yeah. So that's how they could leave and get back. Obviously the whole operation... was carried out underwater. That's where we'll have to look for the plane. Come on.
You see, I've always been a nervous passenger. Some men just don't like to be driven. No, some men just don't like to be taken for a ride. Look at this. An underwater hatch. Yeah.
Then you'll do it? - Yes. - Good. This is  <hon>a Geiger counter.<hoff> You press this lever.

So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida. And there in this house the girl in the bottle plays Spin the Astronaut. I thought you went to sleep. I thought you went to sleep, master. No, no. I decided to work on my  <hon>model<hoff>.
- Oh, what usually happens is that I get paid, but... Well, all right. You'll have fresh water in- - In less than a minute. - How does it work?

But now I think I can safely say that your time and money have been well spent. We're about to witness the greatest miracle of the machine age. Based on the revolutionary law of probability, this machine will tell us the precise location of the three remaining Golden Tickets. It says "l won't tell. That would be cheating."
and they go out to parties in other houses and in turn invite them back here to play? and at christmas, presents are exchanged, and there are plenty of presents because there are plenty of friends. oh. is that it? unlike flora and i, quint. well, your mom and dad were different. yes.
doesn't look much like reeds to me. use your imagination. the boat. it's got a hole in it. what's the use of a boat with a hole in it?
- Shall we continue? - Why not? I'll tell you how I met Timothy in Spoleto last summer. Some friends of mine told me about him and they weren't nice. They were telling me awful things about him That he got drunk before every concert that he played...
- Come on. - Yes. Don't look at my cards. Coming! - Shall the three of us play? - Let's wait.

I'd say you look great, "like a lizard in the sun". Is it a compliment or an insult? It's up to you to decide. - Are your wrists still hurting? - No, they are not.
Listen, I have to tell you that I got married. You see, Martin, she scares me. I'm afraid... Afraid that I can never really possess her. That's how she... poisons me. I can feel her poison in my brain.
Bring us enough food for 60 people! As for all the slave labor, torture and beatings, there's gonna be an end to all that from now on! If you don't give in to these demands, we'll stick it out for as long as it takes! Fucking bitch! No way are we going to cave in to those demands.
And we'll throw the nude man in for free. All right, gentlemen, last orders, please. Oh, do you want a drink before they close? No, I want a kiss. Oh, goody.
A party? No, an orgy. We live in esher. Quite. That's what I said. It's such a bloody whack the diddle-o Fal-di-ral, fa-di-da, lo-di-do-di-do-fum-fum. Mr. burrows, this is no common problem.

I don't care. Toss the cheese over here! (Ancaeus) There are some people sitting up there. - (Tiphys) Kings, we are gods. - (Pollux) The Mysians believe in us.
- (Pollux) The Mysians believe in us. These 'kings' drop everything as soon as they smell something to eat. They even forget to tie up their boat. They just leave everything. No work is completed if they see food anywhere.
These 'kings' drop everything as soon as they smell something to eat. They even forget to tie up their boat. They just leave everything. No work is completed if they see food anywhere. These kings don't know at all what they miss if they let their food be prepared carefully, if they select the coolest water and the best wine.
They simply gobble whatever they find, regardless of its condition. I am sure they will not leave a bit for us. Up there we might find the proper beeches to make a spear. Somewhere in that direction, I'll find water for sure. Make sure to find especially cool and sweet water.
- Forget your friend. Focus on your work. That's easy for you to say. If you'd seen her... It would drive anyone crazy. It'd be good for you to take a trip, have a change of scenery. I might as well. Once I find out what happened to Virginia.
You want her to be faithful? There's nothing between us. Then forget it. You don't know Pedro. - And you don't know Bet. - As if I care.
They're spreading fear. And keeping people away from the area where they commit their crimes. That's terrible. Pedro would never kill anyone. Was it necessary to be this cruel?
"If I don't have any connection, why've you brought her to my home?" "Undoubtedly, I've made a mistake." I'd forgotten that people in this family have to seek permission from you even before taking every breath. And your progeny doesn't walk on the ground which is created by God. "Rather, your progeny crawls on your palm." Let's go away from here.
- I'm sure of it. It's very fortunate that Dr. Williams was here. I don't understand it... These spiders are very rare. Especially around here.
I'll explain it later. Now get dressed, we have to go. - Hello. - Hello, I'm Crotz. Have you checked the documents you stole from Dr. Williams?
I think so. Guita told me you're not interested in politics. I think the policy a rival. Gita, he says politics have its rival. No, you are. me..
Terrible. It's a tragedy. If you lose a guest, you can always replace him. But to lose a valet and a maid in the middle of the season... Listen, that character Bruno, he took some photographs.
But to lose a valet and a maid in the middle of the season... Listen, that character Bruno, he took some photographs. Perfectly innocent, mind you... but if they fell into the wrong hands... Don't worry. They fell into the right hands.
They were such a swell couple. Always laughter, always wine... and always the sign outside the door, "No disturbare. " They never get up until four in the afternoon. What's there to get up for? Nothing's open. It's lunchtime.
Always laughter, always wine... and always the sign outside the door, "No disturbare. " They never get up until four in the afternoon. What's there to get up for? Nothing's open. It's lunchtime. And every night, the orchestra would have to work overtime... because they would dance until dawn.
What's there to get up for? Nothing's open. It's lunchtime. And every night, the orchestra would have to work overtime... because they would dance until dawn. And then you know what they would do? No, and I don't care.
That would look bad. It would be a catastrophe. Hello. Mr. Carlucci's trying to catch your eye. You don't know the people in Baltimore.
Christ. What's the matter? Just thinking about going back home. I hate the whole idea. - Thank you.
Just thinking about going back home. I hate the whole idea. - Thank you. - Right after the funeral... there's going to be a board of directors meeting... and probably a proxy fight... and I'll have to spend a week in Washington... because they're investigating the Armbruster Foundation. And there's that strike... at our electronics plant in Wisconsin.
Right after lunch. - That will be 4:00. - 4:00? That's when they open the mortuary. That goddamn lunchtime again.
I'm so sorry, but I can't let you disarrange... I'm Dr. Thomas with the Scientific Investigation Division. Of course. I'm so sorry, doctor. I didn't realize you were a professional man.
I don't think I could handle that. Don't smother him in pity. That would make him feel worse. I understand. This entire cosmic adventure is demented. What has it done for us?
-In the next century. -In 136 years and two months. 136 years! I understand even less how you prepared for such a risk. The reason is ancient and simple.
Oh, my God. And Hero saw... a perfectly oval, sea-green stone... no bigger than a linnet's egg. "Oh, my goodness! It can't be," he cried. But it was.
-Do you like it? -Yeah. I'm not going to be able to finish this puzzle. There's too many pieces missing. They should be there.
Yes. But without it, the people wouldn't rebel! If we rebelled, the people would follow! Let us not underestimate our strength. After all, the Commander of the Regiment is with us! We can rebel and convince the people to be against the taxes that are to come!
The first person I spoke to and proposed the rebellion was Dr. José Alvares Maciel. He had arrived from Europe... and I met him because he was related to my Commander. I studied mineralogy... and I wanted to know all about the workings of factories. Especially in England. I always wanted to apply the knowledge here.
Especially in England. I always wanted to apply the knowledge here. Brazilians don't know the treasures they possess. We could produce everything if we wanted to Without relying on Portugal.
We could extract iron, make gun-powder... We could cast the iron... if we didn't need permission from Lisbon. As for the gun-powder, saltpeter here is as costly as imported gun-powder. My dear Dr. Maciel, we are here today to no longer depend on permission from Lisbon... nor on imports from Europe. Free, and with your help, we will have our own factories.
As I see it, the problem... is to get enough gun-powder. The new Republic should have no professional soldiers. Everyone will be part of the militia, armed when necessary. When the emergency is over they will return to their occupations. Have the officers been told?
money, gold... the fine jewels hidden in these mountains... Royal, royal, always first. May this sole song be heard in America. Blessed be the August Lusitanian! A serene sky covers the sea, covers the earth... thanks to you, wise and just Monarch! Lèse-majesté is a crime of treason... against my royal person. Terrible crime, comparable to leprosy!
Now, as far as your fine friends are concerned... Don't think that so much gold can be found in a poor poet 's house! I love tranquility... and I know that the people's tranquility is also yours. For, when they're desperate, they seek out the nearest heads. Our beloved Sovereign and her ministers have theirs ensconced abroad.
You wanted some grass? What do you want with some grass? You guys ain't cows, is ya? Little cows looking for some grass? Let me hear you moo.
Tell me something, how are your wife and daughter? I know your daughter goes to primary school. It's good to give her an education, you're a modern man. Nowadays women must go to school too. So...
I would rather you dealt with it. Tressoldi might not like the fact it's us that take action in Milan. If he can't look after his own men, we'll teach him how! First, you'll go to him to ask him to cooperate. He has to hand Luca Canali over to you, but you are the ones that must kill him.
If he can't look after his own men, we'll teach him how! First, you'll go to him to ask him to cooperate. He has to hand Luca Canali over to you, but you are the ones that must kill him. The Italians have a strange type of gangster in mind, they see him being exactly like you, and you have to dress and act like gangsters.
I'm not an undertaker! Don Vito means power, wealth, he's got everyone at his feet! What's been happening? Tressoldi's men came looking for you. They looked pretty mean.
- Hi, Trini. - Hi. - Eva, who are those two guys? - What do you mean who are they? Tell me, who are they? Two American tourists.
- Eva, who are those two guys? - What do you mean who are they? Tell me, who are they? Two American tourists. - Don't tell me who they look like.
And? That's all. Then I grew up. Did your father ever tell you anything about the operation... Like how it worked? What's with those guys, anyway?
Turn this on. Comes across the border at 1 a.m. I can have it to you at 7 a.m. tomorrow. How? In a Chicken Lickin' truck right to your place. OK.
I slept with everybody. My schoolteacher, my sister's husband, the string section of the New York Philharmonic. I want to have sex all the time, play all the time otherwise you're just down, and why be down? The best way to get up is sex. I'm not like my sisters.
The guy was no dum-dum. It wouldn't be long before he knew he'd got the wrong man. This story was like some pornographic photo. Difficult to work out who's doing what to whom. I was still trying when we reached the Temples of Zonk.
(Preston) Sit down! Make yourself at home. Sure, Mick, I knew all the boys in the old days. Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, yeah, Bugs Moran. You bet I did.
And his blood wasn't blue, stop. It was the same as yours and mine. I felt better, stop. That's all I remember. Chapter 13. Outside I hailed a cab.
And no need to play with yourself. That's what's nice about Rome. It's big and nobody knows you. You are free to come and go. What about the Roman women?
Mary, Annie, Elizabeth, Catherine, Alice, Marie Kelly. Six little whores, glad to be alive. One sidles up toJack and then there are five.
Oh, you're so lovely when you smile. Oh, Jack. Must get my grunch thoughts in order, pro and contra. Well, don't worry. You're one of them, only more so.
It's so beautiful. Thank you. I have shaken the silver gong of the universe. Bong! Oh, Grace, it's hard.
That's because at this moment, both the patient and the donor organs are hooked up to individual heart-lung machines. They control the blood flow through those plastic tubes. Is that Dr. Kirshner on the platform? Yes, Dr. Kirshner supervises the major transplant operations. Does he ever operate himself? No, uh... not anymore.
I read in the paper, a block from here, a rat bit a baby! Sorry, but we're well. What do you want from me? - I want you to move out of this dump. - This is not a dump!
OK, everybody out. Come on, girls, sit down. You too, Eddy. Blow. Sure, Ben.
Where are you from? Texas, near Houston. Really? I bet you lived on one of those big ranches you always hear about. No. But I have friends who did.
As it's indicated on the five rules... killing illegal protitutes won't be penalized. Capturing prostitues is like picking up dropped money from the ground. After experiencing economy recession... everybody is grateful for this opportunity. It's as if we're buying 4000 woman with 20000 ryo. Not bad. It's the time to make the most money. But most of the Chaya are out of women.
Now, Iet's celebrate. For our prosperity... Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate! New Year's day, the one day throughout the year... the women won't take a man.

I'll sit there. She was not going to fly. Returning to the case of Evelyne ... His compulsive lying is formed by continuous play every day ... of inappropriate stories and false reports ... as films, newspapers and magazines ... had exposed to age it was not appropriate to receive them. But it will always remain, the basis for any deviation ...
It's always the same, I can not change a thing. There is another who is obsessed the Chinese refinement. He always comes up with something new. I must lie down and wait for my surprise. Once, he brought a snake, I could have killed him.
If any of you can think of anything he did that maybe we should know about, stand up and tell us. You all know these boys. They're good boys, all of them. High spirits, maybe. Tomfoolery. They never meant any harm to anyone. Just scare the Chinaman a little.
Who asked you here? I'm looking for a friend. We all are, John but you won't find one here. You know you're breaking the law? What is trespass?
I mean, who needs a reason? I enjoyed it. I mean, it ain't as if we was talking about a man. May I speak? You tell a man he is something less than a man, and say it often enough and even he will believe it. The price he pays is easy to see.
No. We done it ourselves. Them digging and us trusting. And none of us giving up on each other. Not other men's bones but other men.
Them digging and us trusting. And none of us giving up on each other. Not other men's bones but other men. What will they do to him? They'll take him to the county seat. Turn him in.
All right, you. ln there. Bannack. I was beginning to think maybe the well had dried up. Not much chance of that. Speaking of dry.... You look occupied, Sterne.
Daniela Marcellini, nicknamed Danda, aged 22, Fortunato's daughter, an officer of Ministry of Agriculture, sophomore at the university of architecture, arrested and released for the occupation of the same university, had a right kidney surgery in 1968... Go ahead. Giulio Borsi, co-owner of Roman Pharmo, aged 45, a wife and a son, paid a fine equal to 2,5 million Lire for tax evasion, two journeys to America in 1970, got six months on probation in 1968 for failure to provide assistance, he can speak French and votes for the liberal party. Sir, we can get them in our sights from the gas station's roof. Wait.
Look, I've asked you. It'd cost even less than a TV ad. Right, but there's also another problem. Let's suppose I call to Milan and tell Torreggiani to bring the money here, he does that and we give it to the bandits and that's all. What about then?
Here. - You didn't get anything! Who cares about the hostages? Who cares about the bandits? People want to watch the police!
That's not a toy for you. You didn't even take off the safety catch. Wake up, Jesus! What are you doing? Are you sleeping? You were sleeping like an idiot!
- That's a hell of a thing to say. How you know what I'm gonna tell you? If you said it, I'd know it was so. Only a fool makes up his mind about a thing before he knows what it is. Bunch of Indians stole my horses once and I stole them back.
How you know what I'm gonna tell you? If you said it, I'd know it was so. Only a fool makes up his mind about a thing before he knows what it is. Bunch of Indians stole my horses once and I stole them back. While they was chasing me, I came off my horse and got run over.
I've got something for you, too. This is ten times better than my last knife. This turned out to be a good Christmas. I bet it's even better than Morrel's. Even though he's got money and a big house and everything.
Uh, I just want to get a few minor things straight for the report. I don't want to disturb you, go on doing what you're doing. I'm afraid I'll have to. Are those your guns? Yes, they are.
Boy, isn't this somethin'? Come on in. Hey, that's me! Yes, that's you. Boy. Who would believe it?
I think you're guilty of homicide. I think you killed Mr. Norris and I think you killed the projectionist. Lieutenant, How could I have killed Mr. Norris, or anybody else when I was standing in plain view of everyone in the screening room at the time? You couldn't. No. So you weren't. Yes, but they did see me. No, sir. They heard you.
Shoot. Wait a minute. Flashing your badge to get past a guard is one thing, but this is searching without a warrant. I'm not searching, I'm looking. Shoot.
Now, why you should come here and question me about some unknown, I... I just don't understand. Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Hey, I gotta pay that. One moment. That's it.
What about the wives? What about them? What do we tell them? Nothing. What do you mean, "nothing"?
You gotta make up the difference. Like me in the supermarket... you guys trying to get what you can get. But the point is this-- Hey, George, will you knock off that crap? I'm sick and tired of hearing people... talk about all the corruption that cops are involved in.
Sure. You go right over here-- l'd sure appreciate it if you'd show us. Uh, OK. Come on. Those other cops are coming out.
You know what this means, pal? You know what this means? This guy's got a piece in his back pocket. Who the hell are these guys? They're with O'Neill!
- Hi, Lou. - Sir. - Hey, Lieutenant. - Howie, how's your love life? Fantastic. Listen, it's so good, I'm even laying a little aside for a rainy day. - Hello, Alex. [ Inhales ]
- Fine. Who said what? [ Whispers ] Shit! - What's the matter? - Those guys at the door.
That's real great. Now, let's-- let's take our first call. - Hello, we're buzzing' the fuzz. Your name, please. -[ Man ] /'m John T. What would you like to ask the commissioner tonight?
I didn't do it. Still gonna give these damn things up. The entertainment ain't bad crosscourt. - You know, Danny, you interest me. I try to figure you out. Class of the department. Everybody says so.
- Ferdie. - Hey, you know what, uh, seein' as you're Roby's friend, and, uh, seein' as you guys saved my life, and, uh, seein' that you're a brother, I'm gonna make you a hero, man. You keep saying we saved your life. It's true, man. After what happened to the Indian, these motherfuckers grabbed me outside of Ethel's.
One thing I'm curious about. None of the local fences would touch this stuff. - They claim it was too hot. - My primary business is in the Middle East. The growers of poppies are distrustful of paper money.
You tell me. Would you say that the protection last night at the ball was efficient? Does that mean you want a congressional investigation? You said it. I didn't. But it's not such a bad idea.
Get that report over here right away. I hate like hell to do this to ya, Dan. But I got no choice-- absolutely none. The commissioner pulled me off my section. He made me case coordinator for this heist.
- John, Christine is still with us. - Christine is dead, Laura. - Christine is dead. - Of course, of course. But you know the two ladies in the restaurant? They were watching us eating. They kept staring.
Is this right, ma'm? Yes, use your body weight and cut in one stroke. Get him to a hospital! Where's the finger? What?
Don't believe that one, huh? OK, OK, OK. Coury's Brand cat food. You clawed me, you son of a bitch. Why don't you go home to India? Wanna help me with my jacket?
- Marlowe, just answer the question. You wanna know what I did last night? My cat woke me up in the middle of the night. He was really hungry. I went to fix him his favourite cat food, Coury Brand, the only kind he eats. I was out of it, so I picked something else up and the cat clawed the hell out of me.
How old are you, Willie? How old do you think? Oh, about 40, - I happen to be 18, Man, all bitches are the same, just like my ho's, you know?
Now, the rest of the facts, Mr... The body was placed in a coffin... Ford. The body was placed in a lead coffin. The coffin was soldered without a vent hole.
But if I found it I would never let fall into private hands. It's too dangerous for mankind. No, I'd donate it to the archaeology museum in Karlstein... Where it would be put on show... As one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time. Brother, your generosity shocks me. I bet you're going to go looking for this ancient meteorite...
I understand, it levels off about 200%? - Well, another account... - We'll let you know later? Listen, you guys are in the middle. The banks, they ain't gonna give you shit.
Harry, they are shooting horse in the toilets at the high school! Cuban Pete's daughter doesn't shoot horse. It's funny, every time one of us leaves, I wish we'd made it. I'm not going to Mars. Yeah, I know that but you know, all these hijackings.
Charlie Company. I sincerely hope that you like... what we're going to present, this afternoon. Our field men, of course, will... remain after the show, to take your orders... and answer the questions, on delivery dates... and trajectory and costs. That's... Capri has a very special significance for me... because I was recuperating there, you see?
I don't think so. Can I borrow one of your shirts? Help yourself. That's two you owe me. Salesmen are happy?
What down? I am, I'm coming down. I'm coming down the mountain. Kid, I've got the tablets. I've got the 11 th commandment.
I went to the cottage yesterday and turned the heating on and stocked up on food, just like old times. - When did I last see the place? - What about you? - I don't spend much time there. Henrik's not fond of the seaside.
- Well, I'll be damned! - It's a purely theoretical longing. I wonder if there's something wrong with me, I never feel like that. - I'm content. - So am I. Now I've got it!
- No. - You read it while craving nicotine. - That's true... I intend to show them around. Naturally...
They are Santas or whores ... And just know that St. Agatha round here. Tell me about the girls. Only whores, not holy. Only I slept with Rosa, Rosetta and Rosina after they were married.
And when tourists have seen the ... Place Pigalle, Champs Elysees or the Eiffel Tower, They think they know France! Yes, but the girls are very pretty. Who told you that? I know. I've seen beautiful and ugly.
Perhaps Rosetta was prettier... So, what do I have to do? Okay, you arrive, ring the bell and read out what I've written on the sheet. Ah, the sheet! Where did I put it?
- Bravo, Dr. Bianchi! - Well... thanks. You know, my typist I repeat, my typist, a good girl, from a good family makes, including extras, 180.000 lira a month for banging on a machine 8 hours a day, which isn't all that long. These days in Italy, those who are better off are those who were dying of hunger at one time. The working class are the richest!
May God forgive you. Lf'n I was God Well, just for spite I wouldn't set the sun at night Till everyone was treated right
You ain't gonna make nothin'. Now get on out of there, you old scalawag. You're in my way. Giddyup here! I just hope we got enough here.
There ain't no fightin' fate, no, sir There ain't no fightin' fate Whiskey! The stinkin' smell of whiskey in my house! Now give me that shirt.
What kind of snake? Sidney, you stay out of this. Mary! But this stranger came along with a snake-bite remedy. And as he was pouring it on Muff's leg, he was kickin' so, that some of it just happened to splash on my shirt.
I know what changes have to be made. But can you make them? Nobody else understands that story. Nobody knows it. Mine.
That's all we need for now. The world in a nutshell, you see? 10,000 people. They're people, aren't they? As you like.
So, you inform the police. Next day, the papers run a story on it. Suddenly everyone maintains this friend never existed. So they maintain. What would you tell them? Me?
What do you mean? I know about Vollmer and Siskins' disagreements on the applications of the simulation model. I said no such thing. OK, fine. By the way, I can imagine what Vollmer's shattering discovery was.
He's dead. He can't complain. He had his chance, and in the modern parlance, he blew it. - What? - It's very simple. Let me show you. In the last century, the islanders were starving.
Only as a comparative religion. The children find it far easier to picture reincarnation than resurrection. Those rotting bodies are a great stumbling block for the childish imagination. Why, of course. And may I ask, where is the rotting body of Rowan Morrison?
You know the killer wasn't alone. Yes I know. A man named Jack was with him. He's in jail for the past 15 years. Some day he will be released.
It is not a girl. It is a.. man-servant. A man? Why not a girl? You know girls around here. They're such trash.
He saw me and made me go back. Is there another way we can go to get there? Let's hurry. Ze medical profession would love to claim my achievement as part of their own. And call it a giant stride forwards of medicine.
There are many other holy mountains. The legend is always the same. Nine lmmortal men live on top of the mountain. From the highest peak they direct our world. They hold the secret to the conquest of death. They are more than 40.000 years old.
I drink alone because newcomers are always abstainers. In time they realize that the best liquor in the world is at the Pantheon Bar. Come. Come. Come. I have everything, food, drinks, beds, baths, men, women.
The man who plays the American tourist is David Kapralik, the agent for Sly the Family Stone, a famous American singer. This American doesn't worry about the political situation. They're raping his wife, which he finds very amusing. It's very entertaining. He films it. This refers to the American spirit, oblivious to what's going on overseas.
They hire the character to advertise their circus. He likes money now. He's become an accomplice to money. He announces this show made with toads and chameleons, which were so hard to dress! Their urine was like acid.
I didn't want to work with actors. I wanted to work with real people playing characters similar to themselves, because the first thing I wanted to do was to help the actors evolve. In order to change the world I had to change the actors in the film. I thought, "I will work with real people and enlighten them." I didn't give the actors any directions. I just told them, "Move around."
And that's what I did. He was from Bolivia and came from the Guryev tradition. He taught us the eneagram, which I used in this film. There are nine characters. There is a white peacock, a symbol of enlightenment.
Art is good when it heals, when it's therapeutic. I wanted my films to have an emotional impact on people, to cause an unconscious reaction, so people would leave the theatre changed, charged with a new energy, with some revelation, with something. It had to be more than just entertainment, after which you feel like a stupid child. We see here a facial enhancement operation, they are very common these days. Someday soon the dead will be able to speak.

As long as children's education doesn't change, the world will not change either. Those are the heads of state for every country. They are getting ready to corrupt the children. The Peruvian revolution I talk about here would take place later on with The Shining Path. It was a catastrophe in Peru, and I foresaw it.
Echeverría, the minister of defense, threatened to kill me. I fled to New York with all the footage because they came to my house. There was a paramilitary group called "The Hawks". They were dressed as civilians and started shouting, "Jodorowsky, we are going to kill you," in the middle of the night.
It started getting cold. A storm was coming, but I kept filming. I wanted the horses to be buried deeper in the ground, but the soil was too hard. In this sequence, I interpret every character's dreams. I asked them, "What is your greatest fear?"
"I worked so hard for months and you only get to see them for a few seconds." They are still considered modern art. They'd fit in the Museum of Modern Art. Nobody has yet merged human bodies, in an aesthetic fashion, with abstract sculptures. The creation of this machine is based on metaphysical concepts. I wanted to show a small machine that would get bigger and bigger, to give the idea that this machine was taking over the Universe.
I always wonder what the purpose of art is. Are artists the jesters of society? It's a bit like smoking. People smoke to enjoy themselves, but it is an entertainment that kills. When you go to the cinema and are treated like a twelve-year-old child, you have a good time, but you come out more stupid each time.
It was natural, it wasn't done electronically. It's a divine miracle. This man is an architect. I think one of the greatest evils of contemporary society is architecture, because of its geometric, linear forms. For instance, right now we are talking inside a cube.
I pass by here all the time, but I never knew it was here. Let me help you. - It's all right. Your hands will get dirty. I can manage. The head is missing. I found it. It's here. I found it.
Our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic. I know this is just my imagination but... It is real, Doctor. Beautiful? No.
Know that once, upon your world, I was known as Asmodeus, he who sees all. Gaze upon my countenance, so that you too may see. We came to your world as friends. But wherever we went, the story was invariably the same. Some humans would attempt to use us to gain power, to serve their own greed and lust.
- Yes, Captain. - Explanation? I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the phasers.
Nothin'. It's just-just sheer mud. What'd I do wrong? That pocket strobe light you got won't reach over 20 feet, so you just got a lot of headlights. Some nice shots of the back of his head.
Listen. Listen, fellas. Can I tell you something? This is all a mistake. June 2. 1:20 a. m.
Let's get a look at you. Andy, did you where you wanted? You didn't write to us. I was getting so worried. I can't believe you're really here. Did you know they sent us a telegram? Imagine those idiots in the State department.
It's probably nothing. Go back to sleep. Butchie, bad dog. Butch, how did you get in here? Charlie, the door is open.
Little sons of bitches. No, no, no. They're not individuals, they are individual cells. Tiny functioning parts of the whole. Think of a society, James, with perfect harmony, perfect altruism and self sacrifice, perfect division of labor, organized for preordained roles.
She's at the centre. It is she who speaks. If she died, discipline, organization would crumble. The war's over, Hubbs. They have the power.
Bone. Whoa there, boy. Whoa. You are asked to vote at the termination of the trial of George Saden. Final statement from the accused begins. I confess to the charges, but plead mitigation.
I'm watching. Now, read me the altimeter. 8,000 feet. Eight. Read it again, honey.
But he has done something useful for once. In a few short weeks after the rain this plant grows quickly to maturity, bears seeds, and dies. But even after death, it protects its seeds in those strange-looking pods for a year or more until the rain comes again. Then the moisture causes those dead parts to move like bizarre living creatures, and they open up. And then the moisture triggers little springs inside the pods.
When the rain comes at last, a miraculous transformation happens. The desert covers itself in a wall-to-wall carpet, and an incredible variety of flowers celebrate the coming of the life-giving moisture. For a few weeks, the Pre-Namib tries to recapture the glories of the past when this was a paradise. But the glory is short-lived. The sun dehydrates the earth again, and the flowers return to dust.
But the rain never reaches the ground because the relentless sun evaporates the water before it can fall on the thirsting earth. The invasion loses impetus under the fury of the sun and the clouds are vanquished. And the surviving chicks wait in vain for relief from their anguish. By nightfall, only a few scattered remnants drift around aimlessly. During the night, the clouds regroup their forces.
They merely wait impassively for the rain to pass. And after a few minutes, it stops. Abruptly and suddenly. The thirsty earth soaks up the long-awaited moisture. But in the rocky parts, the water runs off and brings new perils.

Where the red desert ends, there's a vast white desert where it's so quiet, you can hear the silence. The White Namib, a region of rugged moonscapes and endless vistas. Here the eye can feast on breathtaking beauty but for the mouth, there seems to be nothing. Still, oryx roam its boundless plains and on the barren slopes of a desert mountain you'll find a whole tribe of baboons who are quite content to live in these grim surroundings. Of course, those rocks do get rather hard after a while.
They seem to look down their noses at everyone else and always seem to be discussing the follies and the sinfulness of the other animals. The female ostrich is a dull gray, but the male is a handsome devil. At mating time, the handsome boys flash their plumage to impress the girls. And the less good-looking ones have to fight for their lady loves. Finally, a loving couple will find a secluded spot to do their beautiful mating dance.
But they leave billions of seeds in the desert soil because the rain may come again, and they'll have another festival. For now, the desert reverts to bleakness and those few weeks of color seem as if they never happened. There is one spot in the Pre-Namib that is a year-round paradise because the Cubango River streams out of the Tropics. Unlike other rivers, it never reaches the sea. It blunders into the vastness of the desert and is swallowed.
He knows his favorite food is in there, and nothing will stop him. His hide is impervious to bee stings. The only vulnerable spot is the tip of his nose. At last, the payoff. This amazing partnership of the honey guide bird and the badger is an intriguing example of teamwork between different species. He doesn't eat all the loot, because she's entitled to her share.
He has to sneak up very close to his food because his arrow can only kill at 30 paces. The biggest nuisance in his life is the go-away bird who seems to take pleasure in sabotaging him. It'll watch him stalking painstakingly up to his quarry and then tell it to go away. Such beautiful targets. When the water holes begin to grow smaller, the animals get restless.

Such beautiful targets. When the water holes begin to grow smaller, the animals get restless. Soon they'll have to move away, leaving all that beautiful grass uneaten.
Anyone else would die of thirst in a few days in this treacherous desert that doesn't look like a desert but he can survive for months on end. He unearths a bulbous root which is really just a solid lump of wood with hard fibers that are merely damp. Civilized man would need some pretty complicated technology and machinery to get water out of it, but he uses the very simplest of tools. His scraper is a stick that has been split to give it a sharp edge and he produces some dry-looking shavings. But you take a handful, point your thumb at your mouth squeeze very hard and wait for it.

Far away from the desert, the clouds build up into towering masses as they prepare to invade the stronghold of the sun once more. Like a liberating army, wave after wave of cumulus surges across the African plains. Even before they reach the desert, the sun begins to pound down on the upper layers and it tears great gaps in the ranks of the invaders. But when the advance guard reaches the desert, it is still a formidable force. It penetrates several miles into the desert and some clouds even discharge their load of rain.
She cannot rest before she finds him. Luckless guesses it's safe to come out and it dawns on him that he doesn't know the way home. All night long, Mother keeps a vigil for her little lost one. He's never slept alone, and in the middle of the night some big animals come sniffing around. He tries to lie very still and pretend he's only a stone but he's very frightened.
I'm merely an old army friend passing through. As you wish. Your letter urged us to make all speed, but gave no reason. Young girls suddenly become greatly aged. Is that sufficient reason?
I hear that Sara Durward is quite a pretty bed-full. It was just a social visit. And you? Gained nothing, save a fumed brain from too much wine. Still, nothing like a leech or two... a little blood-letting to cool a man's veins, eh?
Is that the car? It is. May I take a look? Of course, if you'd like. How long has this lock been broken?
You're welcome, miss. Would you mind telling me what you're up to? Better we have it developed ourselves. Why? A little imbroglio, darling.
It worked on the babies' nervous system. Why not on those ofthe dead? What the hell are you raving about, man? Craig, when a person dies, perhaps the nervous system goes on living for a while. Perhaps in some very basic, crude way, like an insect's. Or a plant.
I'd like to have a look at it. Do you think you could show me where it is? You can see, Doctor, the radiation works on the insect's nervous system. It drives them mad and they attack one another. I think we're gonna see a real revolution in agriculture.
And Christmas. You're gonna join the Country Club, golf and Mah Jongg, silk pajamas with a monogram right across your chest... Hold it. Now, look who's talking. Journalists.
You want me to get him? Would you, please? Third floor, pressroom. A newspaperman? Don't tell me.
Third floor, pressroom. A newspaperman? Don't tell me. Those guys, you pick them up late at night, they pass out in the cab. You schlep them upstairs, you undress them, you put them to bed.
Pretty sneaky, those Bolsheviks. Who's a Bolshevik? According to this, you were arrested in 1925 for illegal possession of explosives. Oh, yes. Well, I don't know how you feel about Wall Street, Doctor, but I mailed this shoebox to JPMorgan with a time bomb in it.
That has nothing to do with it. I am accustomed to being alone The sense of another presence in the house disturbs me Prevents me from working Just give me time to make a couple of phone calls. I'll see if I can leave tonight As you wish
Yeah, we didn't tell you because you get so worried when he drives - What happened? Has he had an accident? - He just told you, he's been arrested! I didn't say that.
The first time I went into one of those marvellous houses and in the bed, of the lady of the house She wasrt beautiful like you, but she seemed stupendous to me, I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes I was really in love, when I held her It was what I wanted and I did everything I could to stay there My methods, which you are so ashamed of, I learned there they are the same methods your world uses
Who else? If it's close What's up? Oh no, I've been screwed enough for one night. I'll tell you tomorrow, bye
I studied, I travelled, I was in the war Got married, but that didn't work And then when I found time to look around I discovered I was in the midst of people with whom I had nothing in common Oh come off it Professor, we're not that far apart - No, he's right
You know very well it's not true! Oh Bianca, for God's sake, you're only encouraging him! Havert we heard enough of his lectures on the corrupt capitalist society? Is that where we are again? That society doesn't even exist and if it did be grateful you were one of the last to benefit from it
Has something happened? Where I come from doesn't count, it's where I've been that matters right? Kept boy. Illegal dealings, that's what counts Yes darling, that counts
My mind forgets. Is The Fearless One afraid to help us? We travelled many days. Evil spirits watch us when we find island. They make big blizzard.
We just had a talk with our friend and found out why they're so panicky about invaders. These people have been here for centuries. They're descendants of some early Viking expedition. We've actually discovered a lost colony. That's quite remarkable.
Worth millions of pounds. And heaven knows what price the ambergris would fetch. All that doesn't matter now, does it, Father? Freyja, don't be afraid. Think of the saga.
Do you mind telling me why we're traveling in circles? - Circles, sir? - A while ago... the waves were coming from the front, now they're coming from the side. It's that kind of sea, sir. North Atlantic, you know.
Politics? The church. Excuse me. All passengers who had their photographs taken last night... may view the photographs... which will be on display very shortly in the table tennis room. Hello!
That's because you're good. Look at that! We seem to have some company here tonight. Listen, could you throw the spotlight over there against the wine chest? I'd like to welcome some friends.
And he is honest and sincere about it. And the message is, I believe to expose and hold up American society so they can really see themselves. Your honor, I cannot hear the witness. Reverend? I'm sorry.
- December 16th. Bail continued. - You're trying to stop the information! Bailiff, will you remove this man from the courtroom? - Court adjourned!
How she would miss you, Adolf. That's right. After all, who could take my place? Sieg heil! I got that Nazi rat bastard... right between the crack in his ass!

I want to see the man in charge. I'm in charge here. I came to get a car and a pass into New Africa. OK, I'll get you a car and a pass to Niggerville. This is a rotary engine Mazda.
And these days, a soft stool is too important to me... for something to quibble, so I'll make you a deal. Tell you what I'm going to do. You give me the seat, I'll trade for you a bargain. Where did you get this thing? Questions--youth, all the time, questions.
- Yes, but not about the sun! Tell me about the girls. What girls? I sense them and you don't see them? Ciccio, you're with me to look and describe.
Read the matrimonial ones... on the last page. Get on, attack! "Tall, 39 years old, from the north, sports type... is looking for a southern bank clerk, must love children, catholic." Straightforward with all the defects! "Single, good education, would marry young lady... aged 30-40, nice and frigid."
Do you have civilian clothes? I'll pay for them. I don't want to look as if I'm in charge of the fatherland. You're not here to be a porter. There are plenty of them at the station.
Nobody can have me... not even you. It's clear, Ciccio. What? In Genoa that night you searched my bag.
Thou swell, thou witty Thou sweet, thou grand Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand? Both thine eyes are cute too
As quickly as the sound stages went up, careers collapsed. The studio heads were desperate. Where would the new stars, the new personalities come from, they wondered. Well, the answer was obvious. From the theater, from Broadway.
I wanna be loved by you Just you And nobody else but you I wanna be loved by you Alone Carleton Carpenter and I only did this one number in the picture.
Go on. Talk. Me and my man, we was going to Madame Zenobia's. And we was behind these two African gentlemen... who was going in there. First, see, the doorman, he wouldn't let them in.
Then they showed him a letter from their lawyer... that said they were very important people in the diamond business. So the doorman apologized to them and he let them in. Later on that evening, I was in the john. I was relieving myself. And the two Africans came into the bathroom.
No. I'm not a cop. One of them social workers come to rehabilitate my nasty ass? Well, I got someone to take care of me. You watch your own ass. Well, unless he gets here real soon, you're gonna be inside the Women's House of Detention for a spell.
These threads. Silk. Satin. Why? Because Willie's sellin' an idea.
Remember the way it was before, baby, when Willie found you? Remember the stink in the halls? Remember the roaches? Willie, please! Remember the junkies?
Remember the stink in the halls? Remember the roaches? Willie, please! Remember the junkies? What they did to you.
The state of New York against William Andrew Short, alias Willie Dynamite, for violation of Article 220 of the Criminal Code... of the State of New York, possession of narcotic implements. The accused wishes to know if there was a warrant... for legal entry. The accused pleads "Not Guilty" to the charge. I make bail in the amount of $20,000. The accused claims this is a first offense, Your Honor.
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee. Reflex movements are those which are made independently of the will, but are carried out along pathways which pass between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch. We are not aware of these impulses. Neither do we intend them to carry out our contraction of muscles.
It's Frederick Fronkonsteen. I see. - You must be Igor. - No. It's pronounced l-gor.
I see. - You must be Igor. - No. It's pronounced l-gor. - But they told me it was Igor.
Obviously... Hello, handsome. You're a good-looking fellow, you know? People laugh at you. People hate you, but why do they hate you?
I think so. Good girl. Put the candle back. Oh, look, Doctor. A passageway.
You find something, Lieutenant? May I see your shoes? My shoes? Yeah, the bottoms of your shoes. Black.
And, Jess, it's kind of important. Critical important or urgent important? It's both. Right. Arnold... don't tell me about mark-ups.
Get those knees up. That's it. 30 minutes a day, Columbo. That's all. You'll be a new man. I'm out of shape, sir. No question.
There must be love, Laura. Laura, do you know what love is? You're making fun of me. You've hurt your hand... Sir, the door is open. Someone might see us.
My theory is that two stars going nova in the same place in both universes created a gateway which I passed through. In her universe, a nova is a dead star which comes to life! And when the explosions of a nova in her universe and one in our universe occur together, it's possible to travel between the two universes. Then we must return the same way, through the two novas. That would be impossible, Captain.
Not yet. But even at maximum speed, that van can't get away from us. If only we could catch up with it, and we had the moment we need. Leave the scanner running. He must have picked us up with his radar.

About six feet? Very droll. Good day. No, no, I'm serious. All right, let's just drop that.
Wait, wait. That's- I heard you were a newsman. You could be a big help to the Physical Services Department. I mean, they gutted our budget this year, and you know how politicians bow to pressure from the media.
Go." Get out! Get out! Hey, Pepe, how ya doin'? How'd you get here? Well, I just followed you birds south.
Project what? Project what, exactly! And no one will answer that question. But whatever RI NG is, Dr. Avery Walker is a goner because of it, and there's a strong-armed maniac on the loose who has something to do with it. Tony, this story's a blockbuster.
He was big in computer science. A lot of news value. - We'll need an obit. - So if he's that big, we've got him on file. We do, but the last entry in the file was made in 1 967.
Professor Avery Walker was working late. Professor Walker was a member of a crack team of researchers, but tonight he was working alone. He had received specific orders, and, being a fastidious man, he intended carrying out those orders to the letter. 1:1 5 the same night, postal worker Arnold Techman was an hour behind. Techman was addicted to hot Texas chili, but it always made him sick and late, and that made the mail arrive late.
And when we thawed them, they started to exhibit biological function. Biological function. You mean, they- they came to life? You could say that. What did they do after they came to life?
Copenik- Copenik has been working on some strange new strain of cell... they discovered up in the Arctic. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. And those cells are beginning to grow.
He was blood crazy. Metabolism racing. Did he call the animal by name? I mean, did he mention what kind of animal it was? No.
Now you see those vacuum containers? Upended. One upended in this picture, but a second one in this one. Yeah. And?
You know we fired six tranquilizer darts into that thing? No kidding. That's a pretty big dose. Didn't even faze it. Yeah. No kidding.
Including aspects of daily life as well as pleasure, it was a hard life. Setting for "Sisters of the Gion" You lived in a narrow street. So you knew the setting. Every city has these streets, you know.
Yeah. But that was the standard back then. 10 days at the most. Although it took much longer to shoot "Dokuro no mai". Kiyohiko Ushihara: director I began working at Shochiku the year it was founded. The studio was a tent.
Kiyohiko Ushihara: director I began working at Shochiku the year it was founded. The studio was a tent. But soon they built a glass studio. The East and South walls were glass... the rest was wood.
That he didn't need to go to Tokyo for inspiration. That Chikamatsu and Saikaku had found it here in Kyoto. You went to look at Gion? Yes. But as you know... the story takes place in the lower part of Gion. The people there complained saying that Gion... wasn't at all like that.
He rented this house and began working at Shinko. My Hometown" and "The Song of the Camp", and then joined Shochiku. "The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum" 1939 Shochiku wanted him to use Shotaro Hanayagi, a Kabuki actor. But men no longer played female roles in films.
And Mori, Tanaka and I rehearsed. Eitaro Ozawa: actor Although cameraman Miyagawa rehearsed with us... Mizoguchi would direct the actors without positioning... the camera which meant... changes during shooting. Some actors can't achieve... a required pace or rhythm... in spite of their talent.
I never saw the like. Perhaps I exaggerate... but it was the only time I saw him treat an actor with respect. Kazuo Miyagawa: cameraman I met him when... his irritability and legendary aggressiveness... had given way to a profound gentleness. For him a film was like a picture scroll... the successive, changing images depicting a story... that moved steadily forward.
We exist in this environment, we move, we breathe. But it is just a tiny model of a part of our planet. These are flowers, which will yield delicious fruit later. We call the fruit apples, cherries, pears. Please.
Maybe we'd better not fly, guys? - What? - Are you tired of living? No, I'm not. But there're so many mysteries here, and we flee without solving them.
Communication with the ship is blocked. The only possible contact is through the controllers' ball. The fight with these robots was described by Bodyagin. You've read it. You have to remember the page on which it was written. Misha, you're thinking too long. By the system of long-distance communication, the commodore ordered all the working robots to remove their earphones.
The protective blocking prevents the robots from burning out. How to switch it off? I don't know. How? How?
In two years, we've had only four burglaries two attempted rapes and one completed rape. Give me the country anytime. Don't lie there. We just had manure put down. Well, listen, tell me about the girls.
I know every path and bridge and stone. I know every squirrel in the park and I know where they all bury their nuts. Maybe tomorrow I can sneak an hour off, and we can have lunch... -...in the zoo. -l've been to the zoo every day for 34 days.
Where's the music? Where's a cute little tune? They kick you out after 22 years, they ought to have a brass band. Don't get upset. You're gonna get sick.
Two young workers were caught having it off in the street. You told the King? No... not exactly. No friends in court so they were burned alive. When you think what goes on here...
The musicians look unhappy. They have good reason. They're blind. They supposedly play better. Like nightingales sing when you put out their eyes. No one put their eyes out. They're blind from birth.
- I've none. - All of it! Tell your parents the Regent awaits them to come to the palace. Understand? Emily, stay with her. You accompany them;
Is Picard a better lover? Yes, but you're more fondling. Philip the Fondler... Nice name for a King. Or Philip the Débauché.
Mother's right, and you know it. A woman with two kids gets enough exercise. You all complain. I don't complain. I know. But Mother and Lore work themselves to the bone.
Who are these two guys? That's Jonny, that's Marco. Hello. Nice to see you. These guys are good in swimming and diving.
What does she think about me? Did I hurt you? Any violations? Answer me. Where does this stone come from?
It makes you strong and fit. Eat it and keep fit. I don't need it. My body is in perfect condition. Your body isn't okay?
Eat it and keep fit. I don't need it. My body is in perfect condition. Your body isn't okay? - Of course it is.
All seem to be lucky. You will meet a boy. Beautiful and sympathic. Maybe the chosen one. I can't see his name.
Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded by Lieutenant General Charles Gale which has distinguished itself during the recent troubles wants several men to supply the places of those veterans who have deserved to be pensioned at one shilling a day. All clever young fellows who are free and able and are ambitious of becoming gentlemen by bearing arms are hereby invited to meet the Recruiting Officer who promises that they shall meet with every encouragement that merit and good behaviour can entitle them to. Those meeting the qualifications will immediately receive His Majesty's Royal Bounty of one and a half guineas with complete clothing, arms and accoutrements. King George and Old England forever. For a young man in difficulty who had killed a man in a duel and was anxious to find refuge from the Law the chance to earn distinction in the European wars seemed a stroke of good fortune.
Well, this nobleman is one of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet with whom our revered Monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy. In my opinion, you would be wise to fix upon him your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the peerage. When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon, he, or she, is safe. There is no question about them anymore. My friends are the best people.
What is it, lad? Did you buy that horse? What horse is that? The horse you were going to buy me for my birthday. I know nothing about any horse.
Please come here. That woman thought about only one thing... - What is it? - Your friends, Matthew and Melvin... What about them?
That woman thought about only one thing... - What is it? - Your friends, Matthew and Melvin... What about them? Are they alive?
How's it look? Better than last year's. I'd say, 20, maybe 25 million. You're to be commended. But obviously, that is not why I've called you together.
The film's ready. I don't follow you, Lieutenant. Gentlemen, we are ready. Oh, that picture. It's just marvelous of you, but it's horrid, just awful of me. Lieutenant, you want a laugh? Look at those shoes.
Do you think he knew where the camera was? I doubt it. I think when he... knocked over the pedestal, he just froze. Would you do me a favor, sir? Of course. May I take that videotape down to headquarters?
Sure. OK. Hey, that's not fair! You should warn me. Now hold this.
Are they ugly? Close your eyes. God, I'm so hungry. She waited till the old guy was dead, I'll give her that much. Remember that nag Tragopan I gave you to bet on?
Yeah, and have them send up a case of beer. You know, after you left, all hell broke loose. Government agents all over the place, asking questions, making assholes of themselves. They find anything? Yeah, you know that big guy you creamed in the bar? Found him blown in half with a shotgun.
He must have gone during the storm. Drink that. How do you know he's dead? I looked at him. You saw he was dead, and then you made a pot of tea?
He wasn't emotional. He didn't get upset. - He wasn't nervous. - He wasn't me. He was cool.
I send you my fondest love. Adele. My father owes me 2 months' money, May and June. I know that part of this is being sent to me... through the British Bank of North America... but I will certainly need the full amount. Life in Halifax is very expensive.
The strong wave came from outer space. Keep track of it. Professor, here's the city disaster report. 10 miles away from here, there's an earthquake... of magnitude 12 at the Mount Devil This volcano has been dormant for 2000 years.
I didn't see you add any sugar. - Why not? - It's locked up. It's locked up? Yes, sir. Those are my orders.
Look at yourself and tell me that's a tremor. Curious. I don't recall having put a banana in my pocket. I put it there. We put it there together.
The best thing to do is to see the remains of the first victim, the girl on the beach. Okay, fine. Just bear with me, will you? Sure. Wait till we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile. There'll be some fun.
Those black eyes roll over white and then... Then you hear that terrible high-pitched screaming. The ocean turns red. In spite of the pounding and the hollering, they all come in. They rip you to pieces. You know, by the end of that first dawn... we lost 100 men. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe 1,000.
We have to close the beach and hire someone to kill the shark! We have to tell the Coast Guard. You'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel. You'll have to ring this entire harbor! I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems!
Damn thing's jammed. Come on! Kochetygov! Wait till they're closer! We stopped the bastards!
Just like this one! So what? You're not exactly up to her size, you know. How can you have lived so long and still be so ignorant about what every woman knows? What is it I'm so ignorant about?
And for those that work for the progress of the nation! And even today, I'm an old man, and people still value me because I still work. And so we all have to respond, so that we can defend ourselves against that bunch of parasites walking about, they're a bunch of parasites! There's no other name for it. We need to have what all men should have, to beat them every time.
Therefore... Therefore, and because all societies that truly liberate themselves from foreign rule will follow the routes intrinsic to their own culture, the fight for liberation is, above all, a cultural act. The former fascist government, what did it teach us by saying that some of us are worth more than the others. And in fact we're not. But they were trying to divide men, who allowed the government, more and more, to live of exploitation. That's why now, after the 25th of April, we should also, as best we can, bring down these fascists.

Of the people living there, the black men from S. Tomé also lived like the Cape Verdians? - They were worse-off, worse-off. - What were their monthly wages? - Their monthly wages? They got...
- I don't know. - And in Cape Verde? I don't know either, because I came back here, man. I can't describe it, but I can describe how our ancient people, until 1947, what they ate was dried corn and manioc. And when that crisis broke in 1947,
Because once I met this guy, he asked me the same thing, if I fancied getting into his car, and I said yes. As we went past a dairy, he went in to buy an ice cream. And of course, since he didn't eat it on the way, we got to the room, I took off my clothes and asked him, out of curiosity, what was the ice cream for, since he wouldn't eat it, and he said: "Wait and see." And so I lied down, lied down on the bed, and he puts the ice cream down there...
This is the list of the most important things to finish off. Examine it at your leisure and draw up a schedule. We're up at 7 o'clock. See you tomorrow. What's wrong with this soil?
We've created it. Did you know that? With this. - Be careful. The brain is a dangerous tool. Indeed.
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here. Punic War, Prussian War, Peloponnesian War. Crimean War, Wars of the Roses. One doesn't recall them in sequence, but corporate wars... Well, Zero will or can, I'm sure, tell you anything. A memory pool, you see.
You'll dream you're an executive. You'll have your hands on all the controls and you'll wear a grey suit and you'll make decisions. But you know what, Moonpie? You know what those executives dream about, out there behind their desks? They dream they're great rollerballers.
Yeah. I've been thinkin', Ella. Thinkin' a lot. I've been watching. It's like people had a choice a long time ago between... well, having all them nice things or freedom.
At that moment, I was covered by white stuff that soaked me head to toe. One moment, Signora Vaccari. You mustn't omit any details. It's solely how we draw from your stories the types of stimulation that serve us. It's what we expect from them. My dear sir,
Shoot! Fool, how could you believe I'd kill you? Don't you know we'd want to kill you a thousand times to the limits of eternity, if eternity has any. I'd like to tell the story of a mysterious client whose passions are like those that will be the object of Sra. Castelli's stories. And for this I apologize. The man in question wanted only women who had been sentenced to death.
You are beyond the reach of any legality. No one on earth knows you are here. As far as the world is concerned, you are already dead. Here are the laws that will govern your lives. Punctually at 6:00, the whole group must assemble in the so-called Orgy Room where storytellers, in turn, will sit and tell a series of stories on a given subject.
Jesus, this town. Financial statement? I got the heads. Customers come to me. They want me.
All night. You live like a pig. Hal, wait outside. Having lost eight years ago and won this year, I can say that winning's a lot more fun. Who are those guys?
Take care of the kids and the dog for the weekend. Oh, I know it's just a horrible thing to even think about, isn't it? Forget it. - No. Yes, it is, but OK. - You will? The girls at least will love having the dog.
In a sewer? Y eah, it's good stuff. Now put the doughnuts away. All right, ladies. T ear up the truck!
Y eah, it's good stuff. Now put the doughnuts away. All right, ladies. T ear up the truck! Those crazy chicks, they got the truck all over the ground.
Crabs has taken over, and nobody is lifting a finger to stop him! Shit. Half our guys are still out of commission. Look, the cops are on to us now. They're gonna be watching.
Not only. There's something else. What "something else"? When you have an appointment with an unknown, and you don't know what kind of man you will find, it gives you the thrills. All the girls doing this job will tell you the same thing.
Of course. I'm leaving with him. Tell her to cancel him with respect. -You'll see the faces of the men when she comes in -That much? I tell you. When she opens the door look at them.
"I hate actors". I'm asking you now : do not take personnally what I'm going to say. "I hate the french" We cannot accept the lock-out. This is a despotic decision. This time, the management showed his true colors.
I'd say she's already applied to the Emperor for your execution warrant. My execution? - Are you serious? On what grounds? - Does it matter? . Conspiracy.
The whole audience shouted, "O King, live forever!" But this was not enough for the men of Tyre and Sidon. They grovelled at his feat and said, "We repent of our ingratitude! "We sea now that you are superior to mortal nature." "Tyre and Sidon," he replied, "you are forgiven."
We have re-established Britain as a province of Rome 108 years after the Divine Julius left it - not very well secured. It has again become p-part of the Roman world. When I left, Caractacus, our principal enemy, was in f-full flight. We had won a great victory. (CLAUDIUS) A Roman Triumph is seldom granted, but they granted one to me. Me - Claudius the Idiot, the Stammerer, the Fool
Tomorrow. Let him go on his own. I'll have a headache. He's used to my headaches. While he dallies in Ostia, we'll marry in Rome.
It's not easy living with a child who's so stupid. Everything you tell him you have to repeat half a dozen times. What Drusus would have made of him, I don't know. You had something wonderful there, my dear. Tell me, did you never wonder about his death?
She promises now to work for my return. Excellent! I knew it. It's all here. The chart doesn't lie.
The silver needles Steel tongues to excite the blood... Silver needles... The silver needles can remove pain Like the rays of the moon, they heal pain
Steel tongues to excite the blood... Silver needles... The silver needles can remove pain Like the rays of the moon, they heal pain Like the fire of the sun, they reawaken love
Very good Sit down, please Do you have the figures for me? Of course. They're all here
My private life? Well, you've led a colourful life. You're not a saint This interest is the price you pay for success People see your naked ambition...
Unfortunately, that's not it. Thanks, Janos. Great performance. Really great. - Well, that's 12 hours gone. - Yeah.
She's dead. My wife. She's dead. You're not saying... That's exactly what I'm saying.
I think I'd better take a little bit of the potion. The village's future is at stake. Hey there, not a bad start, you really took me by surprise! I got a held up back there in the forest because I stopped to pick mushrooms. You see? I like picking flowers too.
Where is window number 2? ! I've already told where the harbour is, at the sea! - I don't want the harbour, I've told you! - Now gentlemen calm down. People are trying to work. And what is the problem might I ask?
- I don't want the harbour, I've told you! - Now gentlemen calm down. People are trying to work. And what is the problem might I ask? I have no idea Mr. Prefect, they keep jabbering a lot of nonsense. We are looking for window 2.
The wise man doubts everything. Then blessed are the fools, Chudra. Too much knowledge only brings sorrow. What would you say to me if this were to be our last meeting? Do not love gold, it will betray you.
Luiku. Do you think I've gotten pretty? Pretty as death. And our mama, was she beautiful? She was so beautiful that the women chased her from the villages.

Quickly! Why? Get out of my sight! Excuse me for my audacity, my Lord. You seem to be a kind and good man. Don't come here again, stay away from these people.
They set out at sunrise. - Why have you stayed? - I'll wait for the first frost. I must gather herbs, then I'll join them. Just before winter kills herbs, their poison is strongest.
And over there, that's Carbonini. He's the lawyer. And the girl with the long braids, that's his daughter. Are they all scabs? No, no. Landowners.
Why are you leaving? To find another place to work and die. Who put you out? Ah, who can put you out? Landowners.
We're respectable people, Signora Pioppi. Admit it, I look nice in the coalman's hat. Ah, you look irresistible. But I prefer you in my hat. Who are these people?
To be able to say that, you've taken criminals out of prison and put communists in their place? Listen to me, comrades. Fascists don't spring up someday like mushrooms, all in one night. No. Fascists are the padrone's offspring. Inventions of the padrone.
There was no one to take care of the silkworms anymore. There's nothing up here but rats now. Like in the trenches. Hey, rememberwhen no one believed you could see the city up here? But we managed to see it from here.
I'll kill you. Oh, will you look who's here? We forgot all about our padrone. Even forgot to arrest him. Good for you, Leonito. Good boy. The children have more imagination than we do.
You're just a leech but your old grandfather was even worse. It's true. After a hailstorm, he wanted to fire all the day laborers. Oh, he wasn't the one. It was his papa, Giovanni. He's the son. lt makes no difference.
Afew thrushes. Do you like my wife? Very good-looking couple, Ada and the horse. Where's my father's gun? I've hidden it.
But we came in peace! Oh, oh, David, How good to see that you're safe. Have you ever seen anything like this before? No. Those prisoners look human. Yes.
How do we get out of here? I really haven't been able to find out anything definite about the Mahar's secret yet, except that, in some way, it is connected with the lava, with the heat. Well, I'm certainly getting to know about that. Ahh, but that is the point, David. Slaves are used to constantly repair and divert the lava channels.

I don't need none of your lip neither! Ain't you kids got nothin' better to do than lollygag around here? She's my curly-headed baby used to sit on daddy's knee she's my curly-headed baby come from sunny Tennessee and I'm gonna tell you 'bout these women
We'll be OK. What the hell's goin' on here? How come all these people are livin' like this? It ain't no different. It's the goddamn same as all the rest.
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes both sides of the river we died just the same is this the best way we can grow big orchards? Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit? To fall dry leaves that rot on my topsoil and to be called by no name except deportees goodbye, my Juan goodbye, Rosalita
I will take you to Trastevere to eat watermelon. To Via Veneto, by night, to have some ice cream. - And if you want, we'll go by car. - What car? - Come down, Giacinto, three men are waiting for you!
- It won't stop! My house! My house! It' useless to hold it! It's falling!
I've never really wanted to marry you, obviously or perhaps I was so desperate that I did, without knowing it. It wasn't an enjoyable dinner. I was wearing the mink coat that the pelican gave me 5 days before but then, at some point, I felt like a high-class whore and then I got very gloomy and I thought: "What am I doing here? Where am I?"
It wasn't an enjoyable dinner. I was wearing the mink coat that the pelican gave me 5 days before but then, at some point, I felt like a high-class whore and then I got very gloomy and I thought: "What am I doing here? Where am I?" "What kind of people are these if they don't ask me anything?"

He's reliable. Put him up if you have a bed. He'll have to stay in Rome for a few days. Can't you hear the phone? I won't answer. I'm not in for anyone!
You went there yourself. But do the guys down there know that you are coming? No. How could I? They might not take you in.
If only he had recognized the son of that Castelli, Castorelli... We need to inform her, send her some money. Michele always asked us to help her. Today I was thinking about the last time I saw Michele. He came here to fumble in the wardrobe searching for some Sardinian rug.
Is it you? It's here. This is a weird house. Many people have disappeared here. Why'd you bring me here?
I'm okay. I'm fine, really. But I'll see you later. I have to go now, I'll get in touch. Now he just takes two pills and he's like new!
What am I to do with you, Herr Oberst? You're a military hero, awarded the Knight's Cross for gallantry. Yet responsible for the attempted escape of an enemy of the state, abetted by the mutinous conduct of your men. By rights, you should all be court-martialled. Difficult decisions are the privilege of rank, Herr Gruppenführer.
Good. Right, Molly, go to Liam, then go to Meltham House and tell Captain Clark everything that's happened. - Liam must be... I'll try and find him. All right, now come on!
Come from up at Gainesville. They've got him a statue that looks just like him. Every kind of animal in that zoo. He's the one! I got it from him. You know, he told me, he says, you know, them things, ain't nobody knows how old... they don't never die. - Sir! That thing is dangerous!
There's no way, I mean, that you can win a strike with six pickets. So you gotta violate these injunctions. Lawyers are made to get you out of trouble after you get in... not to get you out of trouble before you get in. I'll put it like this- you do what you wanna do. Women all over the country are interested in what their husbands are doin'.
Lawyers are made to get you out of trouble after you get in... not to get you out of trouble before you get in. I'll put it like this- you do what you wanna do. Women all over the country are interested in what their husbands are doin'. They're interested in the safety laws that the United Mine Workers have... and they want their husbands to have their pension funds. They don't want their husbands goin'into these scab mines... with the rock a-fallin'and runnin' these here motors with no brakes.
They didn't care. 'Cause there wasn't no union then. And I don't want my kids to be like that. I want my kids to stick up for their rights and be a union... man. Well, next time somebody gets up in our meetin' and says let's have nonviolence... and don't bother them, let's kick their goddamn ass.
Would you like a sticker? We're protesting. We're protesting Duke Power's control over these men... that voted in the U.M. W. contract... and Duke Power says, "No, you can't have that contract". We have made them... dozens and dozens of proposals... of different language... in these areas of disagreement. They read 'em and throw 'em back. They have no counterproposal. If you could settle it quietly, I would think maybe you'd do it and say...
I found out that the union officials were working with the coal companies. I also found out that the Catholic hierarchy was working with the coal officials. Here was a combination of the whole thing, see - that you had to bump up against the whole combination of them. When the coal and iron police would find out who was trying to instigate a union... well, they'd abuse them. The miners figured, well, the only way they could fight back... was to abuse them, pay them for what they was doin:
And then we knew that was- that was it. # You can read it in the paper # #And the radio tells # # Us to raise our children # # Tell them how safe # # The mines are today # #And be like Daddy # #But don't you believe it, my boy # # That story's a lie # #Remember the disaster # #At the Mannington mine # # Where 78 miners were burned alive #
# Tell them how safe # # The mines are today # #And be like Daddy # #But don't you believe it, my boy # # That story's a lie # #Remember the disaster # #At the Mannington mine # # Where 78 miners were burned alive # And I would like to know, since they died... uh, in order to help the living, find out what caused that explosion. You know, you learn from a tragedy.
My father was a coal miner who was killed in the mines... and my husband is slowly dyin' with the black lung. And my husband and me was in the strike in the '30s... in bloody Harlan County... and I do mean it was bloody too. And they tell me -These miners say we're gonna stick it out... unless Duke Power signs a contract, till hell freezes over. And the men knows they got nothin'to lose but their chains... and their union to gain. So I say hang in there. And, uh, now, this song I composed in the '30s.
- Okay. Okay. - All right. He had the nerve enough, believe it or not, to run for sheriff. We're not gonna have the violence of the '30s. The conditions are not the same.
The union's gonna back you, and we're gonna do all we can... but you gotta win this fight yourselves. Now, it's the first time East Kentucky has stood up against the coal operators, and you're doin' it. And when you win, you're fighting for your kids and your grandkids. Every one of them will have a better life because of what you're doin' here. And that's why the fight's so hard.
But this grand jury was Harlan County... and it seemed like, despite the fact we had won a contract... not that much had changed here. It was just like in the old days. If the company kills a man, the company gets let off. If one of our people had shot any company man throughout this strike... he'd be servin' 25 years now. Bill Bruner is scot-free. Once a concession is won... and once a strike is won, that the workers have to move right on... to the next struggle.
The membership of our union no longer was willing to accept two dollars more a day... and a bar of soap and a towel and a bathhouse. The areas -The main areas of concern to our membership - It's been well established and should be recognized by everyone in this country. Particularly the coal operators. Safety is our highest priority. The men's asking for more than they did before.
Join the struggle! Fight to strike! That we get a grievance procedure that has the right to strike in it... so that we can fight the companies and win our grievances. # We've been shot and we've been jailed # #Lord, it's a sin # # When mom and little children # #Stood right by the men # #But we got that union contract # # That keeps the worker free #

#But we got that union contract # # That keeps the worker free # #And they'll never shoot that union out of me # #And they'll never shoot that union out of me # # Oh, no # #Never shoot that union out of me # # Got a contract in our hand # #Signed by the blood ofhonest men #
# Your welfare ain't on that rich man's mind # # Your welfare ain't on that rich man's mind Oh, no # # Your welfare ain't on that rich man's mind # # They want the power in their hands # #Just to keep down the worker and# # Your welfare ain't on that rich man's mind#

It'll never be driven out of here, I can tell you that. These magazines all have an article on Hitler in them. Oh, Charlie's a Hitler nut among other things. Vince, I have never heard anything like the report the raiding officers turned in on this gang up here. Drugs, sex orgies, dozens of girls running around naked.
So does the DA's office, from what I hear. Not to mention the United States Senate, the fbi, the Department of State. Hank, do me a favor, please. Just help me hang this gun on Manson. Lawyers play with people. And I'm a person. And I won't be played with in this matter.
Not to mention the United States Senate, the fbi, the Department of State. Hank, do me a favor, please. Just help me hang this gun on Manson. Lawyers play with people. And I'm a person. And I won't be played with in this matter. Even though they may know all there is to know about the law they don't understand the free-love society of the generation gap.
Where's the missing link? The motive. The personal motive. You're gonna get up there in front of that jury and try to convince them that Manson wanted to start a war between blacks and whites, so the blacks could take over. - Right. - Charlie Manson, who hates blacks?
Nobody did. We always wanted to do anything and everything for him. During the day of August 8, do you recall him saying anything about Helter Skelter? - Yes, I do. - What was the occasion?

All 12 jurors and alternates state under oath that they have not been influenced and will only consider the evidence presented. I didn't vote for Mr. Nixon anyway. Now, Mrs. Kasabian you testified that when you saw the shooting of Steven Parent you went into a state of shock. Now, just exactly when did that state of shock end? I don't know when it ended.
And just don't let Mrs. Hallet hassle you. Her son says I'm a pretty girl. That what he said? What is he, a pervert? I guess that means little girls shouldn't accept candy from him.
The rent's paid up for the next three years. So three more years like this? Almost all September, he looked fine. If the pain was terrible, he never said anything. Then one Sunday evening... we were sitting in this room... and he whispered to me in a very soft voice... that I wasn't like anybody else in the world... that people wouldn't understand me.
- Yeah? Thanks about the car and stuff. You know, you may be smart, but you're stupid. I mean, if you wanted to get her car away from the front of the house... why go to all the hassle of taking it down to the station? You see, the trick in magic... is to do the one thing so simple and so obvious... that no one ever thinks of it. You see?
I've gotta do this report on government... and I need to know when the school board holds its meetings. Well, would it help you to visit one? No. Actually, all I really need to know is when it meets. Twice monthly.
Did you save me? - It's not... true! I never lied to you even when you were little... and you wanted to know things children shouldn't know. May I... ask another question? Tell me the truth.
- It's not... true! I never lied to you even when you were little... and you wanted to know things children shouldn't know. May I... ask another question? Tell me the truth. If people don't drown, do they live forever?
Don't go away beautiful mermaid! I only want to kiss you. But I fled, because it was very dangerous. They say, in moments like these, you forget about everything. Who you are, where you come from... Where did you find that stone?
- How did you find this place? - I hope the key is here. - How did you find it? - A girlfriend in my building. It belongs to her family.
This I know. Thank you. - Could I have the pencil, please? Miss Opel! Miss Opel. You forgot your book.
This is really terrific footage! I think we can get a hell of a movie of the week out of it. Maybe even a series. A series? What are we talking about? We've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals called the Ecumenical Liberation Army who go around taking home movies of themselves robbing banks.
Coffee? Wanna come take some coffee orders? Hiya. This is my lawyer Sam Haywood and his associate Merrill Grant. Mr Haywood. Well, Ms Christensen, just what the hell's this all about?
The Mao Tse-tung Hour? Why not? They've got Strike Force, Task Force, SWAT. Why not Che Guevara and his own little mod squad? Look, I sent you all a concept-analysis report yesterday. Did any of you read it?
There's nothing you can really do. I'm willing to pay the money. The money isn't important. That's the hell of it, Mr. Courtland. These men are professionals.
I'm willing to pay the money. The money isn't important. That's the hell of it, Mr. Courtland. These men are professionals. If they're caught without the loot, they give up.
Courtland surprised all of us! So just take the money and get out of here! Uncle Bob. Where's Mommy? She's dead, honey.
Sandra Portinari. You've been doing this work a long time? Oh, I'm not doing the restoration. I'm just a workman. But I prepare everything for the specialist.
- I tell you, it's a new one! It still has 90,000 kilometers! But the engine has been refurbished; brand new! Also new? Well, if everything is new, you should sell it for 1 million more!
I am not really hungry but I would like... A good little chocolate... And with little toasts, and with orange marmalade. And a little sauerkraut! The countryside is beautiful!
You're Chief of Counterintelligence, you have nothing to be afraid of. I have nothing to be afraid of? What do you think, Victor Ivanovich? There're more conspirators than there're lamps in this city. The army is retreating on the front with cries of 'hurray'.
I have nothing to be afraid of? What do you think, Victor Ivanovich? There're more conspirators than there're lamps in this city. The army is retreating on the front with cries of 'hurray'. Oh God, when are they going to be here at last?
He speaks of studying the violin. And I would like you to have this one, by the way, as a souvenir. What will become of Miss Deveraux, I wonder, after all she's been through. Oh, she will emerge unscathed. Women are like cats.
Are you surprised? Well, I confess I am. I was not aware that you were bound for Budapest or even contemplating going abroad. It is an odd coincidence. But I'm not sorry for it. Journeys alone are always so tedious, don't you find?
On his right is George McDuff, president of International Electronics. On the other side is Marsh Chasman vice president and controller. They're discussing the service charge that International is willing to advance to secure a contract of well over 100 million dollars. They're the principals in the four missing pages. How much will the charge be?
Used to be a cop. She's the one that stuck the ice pick in Frann, also for the 4 million. That's the 4 million there, huh? You never told me who that money belongs to. Why, Charlie, it belongs to you if you want it.
- Maybe so. - Detective Oller. - Yeah? - Telephone. Excuse me.
I don't have to believe something that's not true... Don't say that, don't... - Don't say that, Brian. - We're ready, Ms. Hoffman. These songs... that he's writing are really good.
I personally can't see that, shooting birds. It's cheaper than shooting craps and better than shooting people. I can't see shooting doves. My dentist had this freezer filled with doves. I hate that.
Get out of the door, lady. We don't want to hurt no lady. Franklin! Are you all right? Jabo didn't say nothing about no karate! Customers can't use the place.
Yes? Well, a friend of mine and his. I see. Craig... Yes, Uncle Albert?
Who's that you're with? Lester, how's everything going? Well, hello, suavey. I was just telling Mary Tate here how fine everything is. Except those damn Jap tools. They are killing us, Craig.
Speak to me of this Margo Winchester. I like the large milks, but it converted me. She has a époustouflant bottom. You will not gourez. Its milks are enormous.
I will reserve to you one moment this afternoon. Not so quickly! The stones hurt me! There are not time. A step beyond abyssals zone of the extase.
John, I don't mean to intrude, but... You're not intruding, love. What is it? Well, the blacks are inferior to us. They are incapable of learning all but the most basic of concepts. Yes, most hold to that, my dear. Then why should we be afraid to teach them?
You're not intruding, love. What is it? Well, the blacks are inferior to us. They are incapable of learning all but the most basic of concepts. Yes, most hold to that, my dear. Then why should we be afraid to teach them? If they are incapable of learning why is it a crime to teach them to read?
Here, stay put now. Damn it! Hold still. Ain't you got no brains at all? You do what I say or I's gonna go hard with you. Move again and I'll pull your behind out through your nose.
Ain't got no more massas. Nobody going to whup us again. Nobody gonna abuse our women. That's right. Freedom taste good, don't it?
Look here.... l sure is thirsty, girl. Has you got any water in here? Fetch me some. I glad to do that. Got some lovely fresh spring water.
This belt was made in France. All 200 that were imported had the same length. You can more or less work out the size of the woman who wore it. It was a slim woman with a waist of around 55-60 centimeters. But the victim was chubby and weighed over 60 kilos.
Darling! Welcome home, darling. I just saw you on TV. You were so amazing. Buddy, take this pig and get the hell out of here!
- What do you mean gone? - Gone, sir. - Is this your room? - Yes, sir. Your clothes are here, Angel.
There was no exercise today, sir. Request to see the Governor, sir. Archer, the rulebook... The rulebook says, "Exercise is dependent on the weather." It looked like rain.
The whole of the A wing thought the fish was bad? Yes, sir. - What about the other wings? I think I can explain this, sir. I do remember the day in question.
She was called Agnese Bignardi. We have unquestionable proof of her identity. Her father reported her missing in August, '72. But he hadn't heard from her for a long time. That's a photograph of her. She very seldom wrote letters. Actually the very last postcard from her was in February.
So, Agnese Bignardi had a relationship with him. Well so it seems. I don't mean to insinuate. The only thing I want to do is to prove the innocence of Francesco Ducci. And this picture, I repeat, certainly makes it clear.
He told me a story that was so incredible it took complete hold of me and made my heart search for the very truth of existence itself. All right, I know, it sounds bizarre. But I went to India, where I found a way of life that was indescribable. I found brutalising poverty, starvation, death, pestilence. But I also found something else.
Among the first witnesses will be Gupta Pradesh, the holy man from Benares, India, the maharishi, whose task it will be to convince 12 American jurors of the truth of reincarnation, which will form the basis of the defence's case... a case unique in the annals of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, a case that has riveted the attention of the entire world. Many of you look upon death as the ending to life, a leap into an eternal nothingness from which there is no return. Because of this, you are filled with dread and despair, even rage, at the injustice of death. We in India are not afraid of death.
Come on, Mrs Templeton, please. Listen, your daughter is in mortal danger. Do you know that? She could possibly die if you don't listen to what I'm telling you. Now, try to understand.
-Mr. Corley, how are you? I don't think we got very much here. We did a routine search. Checked cargo against manifest... Look, I don't want to say this again, but I got $200,000 worth of Christmas novelties out there waiting to unload.
Syndicate, huh? Consortium, yeah. Plug that into the battery there, darling. Thank you. So if you don't mind, we'd sure like to take a few pictures. Yeah, consortium, huh?
Say, you know what I'd like to do? we'd sure appreciate it if we could start shooting inside. Sure. Come right in here. Oh, that'd be just great. Go ahead, darlin'.
You tell your men. Be very careful, be very alert. Very dangerous, very professional. He watches everything, everything. Here he comes. Yes, it's Fasil. Any messages for 39?
Don't leave me, don't leave me. My last... Christmas in captivity, they allowed me one letter... from Margaret. And in it was a photograph of Margaret and the kids standing in front of the house. And the shadow of the person that took the picture was in the foreground.
- Marines. - Good. The broads overseas got it made. Sucky fucky, five bucks. Our girls have a thing called entrapment. They want to say sucky fucky and have you say the price.
Uh, this is Lyles and Slate, Scuz. - Sam Lyles. - How are you? - And I'm Slate. - Oh. Glad to have you for a couple of weeks. Here's your coffee, Scuz.
He raises his matted head. He opens his great square teeth, and he says: "Why? Why me? Why, ultimately, me?" "Do you imagine you can account for me..." "totally, infallibly, inevitably account for me?" Of course, I've stared at such images before... or been stared at by them, whichever way you look at it.
Do you find them sexy? What? - Horses. - Don't be daft. Girls do.
Why not? Surely it would've been fun, after being cooped up in that shop all week. Didn't care to, that's all. Anyway, it's my turn. I told you a secret, you tell me one. All right.
He knows no physics or engineering to make the world real to him... no paintings to show him how others have enjoyed it... no music except television jingles... no history except tales from a desperate mother... no friends to give him a joke or make him know himself more moderately. He's a modern citizen for whom society doesn't exist. He lives one hour every three weeks, howling in a mist. "With my body, I thee worship." Many men are less vital with their wives.
What do you mean? I mean, on and off, that whole year... I had the feeling the horses were being taken out at night. - At night? - Just odd things I noticed. I mean... too often, one of them would be sweaty first thing in the morning... when it wasn't sick. Very sweaty, too.
He's here about me, isn't he? why do you say that? what about the coroner's report, the testimony? The file's that thick. Yes, I know.
I don't bother them. They don't bother me. Your predecessor, Dr. Ashley, hired me. It is a shame he died so all of a sudden. He was going to make some very big changes around here and then... Did you see your view outside?
- I'm sorry. Your fingers are cold. Here. They took the candy box- a man and a woman. That's right. Everything's fine.
It is better that we take our sorrow for this wonderful woman into action and perhaps revenge. Yours, John Watson, who speaks here for many others. YOUNG JULIA: I see a gun. YOUNG LILLIAN: I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it. JULIA: I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it,
Yours, John Watson, who speaks here for many others. YOUNG JULIA: I see a gun. YOUNG LILLIAN: I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it. JULIA: I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it, -but it won't shoot.
We are having trouble getting that report. We'll try back later in the program. In the mean time, this is "A.M. Today." It's 18 minuters after the hour, and time for our daily debate: Count Pointercount" with J. Fitzsimmons and S. Hamilton. Sheila, I guess even you and your liberal cronies have found the light at the end of love with our beloved president.
Gentlemen. Regrettably, we have discovered among us am unfriendly visitor. Mr. Loo will be punished for his treason. But that is not important right now. What is important, is that my guards have accepted bribes and failing their duties.
I do my best. Welcome to "The Wonderful World of Sex", where together we will achieve a new level of sexual fulfillment. After dimming the lights, give your partner a reassuring smile, and a gentle kiss. Then, move to opposite areas of the bedroom to disrobe. The revelation of erogenous zones is an enticing prelude to sexual foreplay

I'm Dr. Terminus, and this is Hoagy, who's doing his internship with me. - I realize you must be disturbed about it, and, uh, up to here in dragons. - I'd rather not discuss it. You know, Pete, I have always loved dragons. They're such wonderful creatures.
Claws! Claws so sharp they could tear a man to shreds. Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya. And a tail that's so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate! It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail. Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward.
Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya. And a tail that's so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate! It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail. Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward. A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!
I don't think there's any question that martial law is needed in the city of Montreal at this point in time. It's a necessity. It has already been established that victims of the disease, and it is not rabies, though it may be related to the rabies virus. Victims of the disease are beyond medical help once it has established itself to the degree of inducing violent behavior. What you're saying, then, Dr. Gentry, is that... What I'm saying is very simple. It may not be very palatable for your viewers. Shooting down victims of the disease is as good a way of handling them as we've got.
I was in a little boat on the river. First I was alone; suddenly you were sitting in the boat. You were sitting beside me. I laid down and slept. I slept, you came up to me and it began to snow.
You make me so happy. Yes, I will follow the doctor's instructions. Rest for a month. Three months. You'll go to the Randall's yacht and rest.
-Tintorera. Americans like you call it "tiger shark". -Los veo luego. -AdiÓs. Bye!
Just my brothers and I. But they only do it in the season. They prefer another kind of fishing, which gives more. You mean there's a season with more sharks? That's right.
-Because it's a tough and difficult job. Plus, they always have problems. It doesn't rain, or it rains too much. I'd rather be a fisherman. The sea may give you just enough to eat.
Delia, queen of the fairies... was presiding over the feast of plenty... celebrating 3,000 years of peace. In the midst of the celebration... Delia felt a pull from the skies. She looked up and saw dark clouds... forming on the horizon in every direction. She fell into a trance and left the party... heading for her home on a high hill. At first, the fairies were puzzled.
For5,000years, Blackwolf studied black arts... increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold. He built a small following of frog-like creatures... but needed more troops for his evil plans. He then formed an army whose generals were called up... from the black shadows of hell. Souls who waited for untold eternities for a new leader... Blackwolf's tremendous power... enslaved them all to carry out his will. Then stories of Blackwolf's armies... attacking neighboring countries came back.
It's done! With the assassination of the presidents of the free states... comes their fall... and that of my brother. It's done. We have four more lights left, sir... four more. It's not important! The main exterminations are complete.
Sure do, Peewhittle. I don't believe those blokes are gonna try it again. I'm scared. Now don't be, governor. You're too young to remember... but Blackwolf must have lost one million men here... last time he tried to invade. And if Blackwolf's stupid enough to try it again... he'll lose twice more.
You'll be flown to an island near that point. From there you'll be transferred to a helicopter. The helicopter will fly you to the space capsule and you'll be put inside. It'll take the Recovery Forces a minimum of an hour and a half to reach the splashdown site. By then, you'll be inside the capsule.
It'll keep something alive that shouldn't die! Before you all begin to moralize, you take a look around. You look at what we've done and how much more we can do. You look at what we've meant to this country. Nobody gives a crap about anything anymore.
May I call you again, sometime? Yes. Yes? There's no one inside? Are you sure?
There was a moment in these past few days when we were all one people. We were all hoping, we were all a little bit taller, a little bit prouder. We were all feeling the same fears and the same exhilaration. These three men brought us together. We knew together that there are no goals we cannot reach if just reach for them together.
I keep on having the same readouts. Well, what readout? Well, sir, I ran a program on my own just to check something and the readout is different. You ran your own program? Yes, sir, and...
So am I. I'll even let you break. Can a person be more serious? You're drunk. I knew there was a reason I was feeling this good. I need a drink.
We're dead. Shit, I was such a terrific guy! We tried to establish radio contract, contact with the spacecraft an we were unsuccessful. It landed off course. Why haven't they said anything to us?
Now this project could bring progress and prosperity to the whole third world, including your own country. I admit that's one of the possibilities. But the risk frightens me. Wait a minute. Your Excellency! Now what risks? You intend to keep the heat of the sun locked in there.
You can twist those to fit any kind of madness. People called Marx the Antichrist-- Hitler, Stalin. - Genghis Khan, Tamburlaine. - All right, you've made your point. What about the computer?
Stop it! Stop it, Kaji! Kawashima, you falling for this little girl? Trying to look big and break your promise again, huh? Girls are so tempting, aren't they?
- You're a genuine find. - Yes, she certainly... And if I were a hundred yahrens younger... But some young man will soon fall into the lap of early glory. I was told in instructional period that some people are just naturally slow.
Launch when ready.' I have examined your epistle suggesting you can locate the humans. Why, yes... Oh, yes. I... I think... as they do!
You said they were doing fine. Yes, but a long way from being able to fly a real mission. it's too risky. Everything we do has an element of risk. - They're shuttle pilots. - They're warriors.

They would've told us. We can't just leave Apollo out there, we've got to do something. Really? Any suggestions? One - if we can get the Colonel and the Commander to go along.
(Man) Let 'em be. (Red Eye) What are you doing here, Bootes? Dropped by to see my sister... and I heard a noise. A noise?
(Red Eye) What are you doing here, Bootes? Dropped by to see my sister... and I heard a noise. A noise? Yeah, it crossed over my place, passed over this way.
Do you think she's the right one? Goodbye, goodbye! Don't you miss your friends? Why? I feel good with you.
I'm planting seeds. What kind of seeds? Tomatoes! Now, what are you doing? Hiding them where it's warm under the straw.
Get some of those big "furry" leaves from the field, grind them and then get some earthworms. Grind that all together into a paste. This doesn't look like an "E" to me. I've been ready for a while. What are they doing up there?
He's such a pretty baby! He may even be a gentleman's son. From now on, he's only a peasant's son. The first thing is to love him and he'll be happy all the same. Come Bettina, let's go see our tomatoes.
Give us a bargain, she's getting married. Ask any bride around here if I haven't made them happy! Quiet now, Friki is a rascal! One day a group of foolish boys had the idea to throw stones at French soldiers passing by. Their commander, General Lutrec, decided to burn the village to punish them.
He didn't believe the man and thought it was trick, so he came here. When he saw the Madonna crying, he fell to his knees and put his helmet and sword at her feet in devotion. 350 years have passed since, but that sword and that helmet are still there to remind us of all the dangers waiting in the world. We gather here each year to remember that great miracle, and to remember all the other miracles that happen everyday in every corner on earth in the lives of men and of all creation. Dear people, we wouldn't be here without miracles.
While she's lying in, she should eat white bread. That would be best. I'll take care of it. Ladies, I don't know how to thank you. For what? If we don't help each other... You took too big a risk by not calling the midwife.
Yes, he's home. Why are you so late? He must have gotten lost. Children don't think that when they come in late... Let's put you by the fire, the ashes are still good and hot.
I'm angry, I'm not afraid! Start with some prayers. Put some water in this glass. You should pray too... Worms, these are worms.
Start with some prayers. Put some water in this glass. You should pray too... Worms, these are worms. The fright made them come out and they went all through your belly.
Put some water in this glass. You should pray too... Worms, these are worms. The fright made them come out and they went all through your belly. We all have worms and while we leave them in peace, they don't move.
Be well, all the best to you. I want to congratulate the happy couple as well and say a few words to them and all of you this morning. There is nothing to wonder or talk about if this couple has married so early in the morning and not as normally done in the light of day. They have nothing to hide. The reason is another.
Like you, I heard only stupid words of resignation. Like you, I wanted to die. And you found the courage to go on without her? I decided that, though she was dead for others, for me, she was still alive. Listen, Mazet, I'll tell you what's important.
Yes. You didn't let me tell you. Can I tell you now? I'm listening. We're alike because we have something important in common.
His name was Simon Jardine. He came from Ireland. During the 30 years he spent in our region, policemen and judges didn't have a lot of work. His reputation for probity and logic was such that anyone who had a quarrel wanted him to arbitrate it. And this couple?
Yes, it's the only photo we could find of him, but you must admit that, when you look at this photo, it's difficult to think of this man as an enemy. And the musician there? Did you know him? Yes, I'd almost completely forgotten about him, but when I heard a piece he'd composed on the radio, I realized his clear and sunny music is perfect to accompany the memory of my dead friends.
Did you know him? Yes, I'd almost completely forgotten about him, but when I heard a piece he'd composed on the radio, I realized his clear and sunny music is perfect to accompany the memory of my dead friends. So they're all here. All the people you've known, all the people who have counted...
I'd gone to my cousin's house to get some rest, but at the station, I missed him. I went to the wrong floor and knocked on the door. Yvonne opened it. I was very lucky. No, Gérard, I'm the lucky one.
Richard, I have to ask you something very personal. - We're friends. - What happened to your brother in London? - Why do you ask that? - I opened a box that was sent from Israel.
Give me a bike. Son of a bitch. - Peter, Peter. - Where the hell are you? In the elevator.
Many have died last week on these streets. In the basement of this building, you'll find them. I have given them the last rites. Now, you do what you will. You are stronger than us.
- You need more men? - No, it's all done, man. It's all been done. Jesus Christ. Why did these people keep them here?
I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna try not to come back. I'm gonna try not to. They use 5 percent of the food available in the human body. The kind of-
-Ah... -The people here are having a great time, Mojica. -Thank you. Yeah...you're right. Only you could give such a good time to the employees lt's true!
And for anybody else who wants to share this garden... then we created a price... which amounts to more than any other garden that we have. I think that I'm motivated all the time... because I have so many experiences... of motivation. I understand it quite well. One thing that this gentleman... to my left always said, and it sticks in my brain all the time is that: "The emotions are not always subject to reason...
The ugly crisis... which we used as our basis... and this was nothing against the SPCA of Santa Clara County... or the Animal Control Officer of Santa Clara County. But the idea that we needed the concept... for the people that loved their pets, and needed a place for them. Not the garbage pit, not the garbage can... and a place to bulldoze them into the ground... because we have more love and desire for Mother Nature's little pets. God only gave us these pets... to be our fellowship, desire, and will. And what have we got to give them in return?
And right away, his father had grabbed the phone... And back in North Dakota, very few people had phones. But at this particular farm, they had a phone. He called the rendering service outside of Valley City... and asked them to come and pick up the animal. I've had people call who have an animal... and they want us to bury it.
One was to wash... and the other was to take the clothes and put it in the dryer. So anyway, the job was done. The girl threw the clothes in the dryer and slammed the dryer door shut... and walked back to the kitchen. As I understand this now... she heard some meowing and frightened screams of the cat. They were looking for the cat and couldn't find the cat.
As I understand this now... she heard some meowing and frightened screams of the cat. They were looking for the cat and couldn't find the cat. All of a sudden... they heard it in the dryer. They opened the dryer door up, and the cat was in the dryer. The little cat suffered a broken neck.
I have to memorize the routes, know exactly where they are. What road to take to get to it... to get back on to the right road, to get to the next one. Naturally, there's an element of fear that I have. With our Permalloy markers... we have several different formats that the people can choose from. You can see some of the different formats right here.
We do not have to go too far afield to make this conversion... because we have our own chapel... we have stained-glass windows, we even have a bell. We're usually talking in terms of death and talking in terms of hereafter. Well, this is the very essence of any other religion. So if in the hereafter there are no pets, I think... I don't think any of us that love our pets would really... feel, maybe... I can't say we wouldn't want to go, but...
It's just mind over matter. You have to prepare yourself for it. We pick up animals that are 150 pounds, greyhounds. They're very heavy. We have to bring them in to our bodies... to be able to hoist them into the truck. It's mind over matter once again.
You can hear it from miles away. I think we'll all be together again. I think we're going to live pretty much like we do here. I want to be able to find my pets. I don't want them dug up and scattered all over creation.
Really, I thought you`d be different. I am different, God damn it! Stop comparing me to Scooter. Skip! I am not comparing you to him. Oh, listen, Charley... I don`t want to hear a sentence that starts:
It's not terrible at all, but... why did you wear men's clothes? I'm not so ashamed to pay for it with men's clothes on as I am when I wear women's clothes, as I have sometimes. Maybe it's stupid. It's just a feeling I have. when I pay for it as a woman I feel so terribly ashamed. -You understand? -Sure, I understand.
active, decisive, independent, apparently. All that time he lived off me, and he wasn't ashamed of it. That was important for me. Believe me, Zora. He wasn't the type to be a pimp even though our money came from other men with whom I slept. At first he used to ask me about them.
He mastered this system of rewarded lies so well that no one noticed how the quiet child turned into a sad one. Erwin was a gifted pupil at school. Learning was no great effort for him. But after 18 months many things changed for him. A couple who wanted to adopt a child grew attached to him. They invited him to their home and occupied themselves with him.
The mother said a prayer for she didn't trust the old woman and the children had always been forbidden to go into the woods. So the old woman put a curse on the cottage and its occupants. Because I love you... Sleep, baby. Go on, Zora and I'll fall asleep. Please, please go on.
He waited for weeks without ever asking why probably fearing what the answer might be. His yearning was so great that hope lingered longer than reason would allow. So long, in fact, that it began to smoulder in his head. Erwin was seized by a fever that no doctor could cure. whatever it was, the miracle came about.
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. If by life or death I can save you, I will. How long will we be in these marshes, Aragorn? At least two days. I'm being eaten alive!
Troubles follow you like crows. Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Justly spoken, Lord. ln the east, the Dark Lord is stirring in Lorien, the Sorceress of the Golden Wood weaves deceit. And such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return. It is I who counsel the King now. He hears you no longer. No, Grima Wormtongue.
I can't see very well. Well, what's the matter with him? It was only a little wound. It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam. I think that a piece broke off in the wound and is working inward.
They'll never let me go. They won't let you go, either. They tell you they'll let you go, but in fact you stay. You see, we all of us come from a factory. Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work.
You can fade so far out, you don't know where you are anymore. I find loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over. To the Turks everything is "soyle boyle". It means "like this, like that." You never know what will happen. All foreigners are "ayip." They're considered dirty.
Some friends said they might be backpacking up here. I haven't seen'em. Did you talk to the sheriff's people? - They said it was a big mountain. - They're right. It is.
Did you talk to the sheriff's people? - They said it was a big mountain. - They're right. It is. I figured they may have followed the river. Are there any places to swim near here?
I hiked up here once with my ex-wife. They had guard dogs out. The fence was electrified. The works. "BR." Barbara Randolph. Man, that is cold.
They had guard dogs out. The fence was electrified. The works. "BR." Barbara Randolph. Man, that is cold. Their parents said they were excellent swimmers.
They breed like flies. There'll be no way to stop them. Would you talk sense, dammit? What about those kids? I can't tell you.
Our goal was to develop a strain of this killer fish that could survive in cold water and then breed at an accelerated rate. We had everything. Blank cheque. And then the war ended. You sound disappointed. They poisoned the water.
Not a single nail in her. It's all lashing. - Where's your daughter now? - Summer camp, other side of the dam. Just how sturdy is this thing?
What is the effect on the environment? Weii, there's a general decrease in the productivity of the White Niie an immense decrease, in fact. -it takes what, fish don't grow or...? -Weii, larval fish die. Species like the tilapia which makes a nest on the ground, does not find the possibility to do so because the layer of the decomposed water hyacinth is several feet sometimes.
Stubborn and baffled, stranded almost within site of their former doorways they cling in mute loyalty to a place suddenly become strange and alien. Today they are trying to begin again. Born to a desert without rain, they are becoming fishermen. A new fishing industry is being developed at various settlements around the 300-miie lake. To Jean-paui cornu, a member of the cousteau team Sudanese official Muhammad Aii tells of joint efforts to help the readjustment of Wãdi Haifã"s displaced survivors.

But as the cousteau team discovers the present, no less than the past, still owes its existence to the river. y ear by year, more lives are suspended on the river's slender thread. in the expanding cities of egypt and the Sudan, in cairo and Khartoum in alexandria or Juba, the populations multiply threaten to outpace the food supplied by the river's narrow margin of fertile earth. egypt remains, as an early historian described it, "the gift of the Niie a crowded oasis locked in the immense emptiness of the desert." To meet growing needs, men have built huge structures across the Niie turned the river god into a servant.
Not only are ancient cultures and animal sanctuaries threatened by extinction but men are learning that technological triumphs sometimes create problems greater than the ones they seek to solve. On the Niie, man has preserved some of his noblest monuments. Today, it is the river itself that may be most in need of his protection. Long travelers upon and beneath the seas phiiippe and Jacques cousteau this time take to the air. Their first destination, the mountain headwaters of the Niie.

As the catalina climbs above the waters off corsica the cousteaus leave behind the Calypso in which they have been charting the Mediterranean's increasing pollution.
Obviousiy, says cousteau, the insects must represent a major threat to human ecology in central Africa. Dr. Gruvei agrees. Not only does the tsetse fly carry its debilitating and often fatal disease to man but its lethal effect on domestic animals has been a continuing obstacle to stock raising in the infested regions areas in which malnutrition often is widespread. Offering to demonstrate the process by which the insect feeds Dr. Gruvei has a tsetse fly placed upon his own arm. Quickiy, the hungry fly takes its stance, inserts its tubular snout and within a minute, is ready to take blood from its donor.
Look out. Get out of my way. Watch out, you people. Can't you put that thing out? Come on, take a shot.
I'm afraid to speculate but I think the bees did this. You're saying these bees eat plastic? No. But I'm wondering. Your American honey bee has a weak mouth. It couldn't even break the skin of a grape. But it looks like this species is tearing up plastic cups possibly to line their hives.
When it stopped, they left. I still don't understand. The sonic alarm system happens to be an exact duplicate of the duet between the queen bee and the young queen bee challenging her. But bees can't hear. That's right. They go by vibration.
Here come your choppers, as ordered. No, thanks. High in potassium, low in sodium. Report immediately any sighting of swarms. Tell us what you're looking for, we'll try to help. I'm looking for bees.
May we talk? Alone? I don't recall our discussion about the use of chemicals. Now, listen. My orders are to assist you in your scientific endeavors not to consult with you on military matters which are none of your damn concern, sir! These bees are of joint concern.
Understand? We've discovered two identical sound patterns. No, I don't understand. What has that to do with killing bees? What you are hearing is the African bee's mating sound. But listen. This was made by the alarm system, not the bees.
But listen. This was made by the alarm system, not the bees. But they sound exactly alike. The alarm system at the missile base drew them in. The similarity confused them.
Busting a bevy of nuns, a guy pisses on my leg. I lose my special canine sentry dog. The best cop I ever knew. - See anything? - Negative.
What's going on here? Who are you? Who are you? We're from the finance company. We came to repossess the furniture.
Can you believe it? They burnt the whole thing yesterday. They're expecting a new one in from Tijuana. It's supposed to be worth millions and millions of dollars. The cops are out looking for it now.
They're expecting a new one in from Tijuana. It's supposed to be worth millions and millions of dollars. The cops are out looking for it now. Jesus, I hope they find it. Me too.
Spilt the sugar. I'm sorry, I'm only trying to help! Well, if you want to help, why don't you go out for a walk or something and let me do the packing. I don't want to go for a walk. I told you it wasn't a shark.
- I couldn't find it. - What did I tell you? - Studio 5. - Says 5 over there, right? - Yes, but the door is closed.
This is a normal working day. I want us to discuss the country's business, see what is to be done and do it. The Turks rob near Giurgiu. There was no agreement about the borders of Turkish counties. In this way began all robberies in past years, from Giurgiu.
Haven't you seen it with your own eyes? Haven't you had a rope around your neck? Do you think I came here to play the prince? I gave you a sword. Handle it.
My man can testify that. A war against Mehmed is undesirable. You know that. We have enough trouble in the west. This letter is the stake Dracula wanted to stick into the heart of Christianity.
Where is the big sea? Not even 50 years have passed since the lords were vassals to the King of Hungary, and tributaries to Mehmed. Servants of two masters. This is what this country has become as a consequence of your reckless actions. Your Highness came to the country to kill the Lord and replace him,
The afternoon radio show presents:... "interrupted Symphony." Romualdo lzaguirre, a talented piano soloist, the scion of a rich family, has fallen in love with María Inés, a clerk in a store, and is about to marry her. This attitude by Romualdo, young and attractive, has unleashed the the jealousy of Patricia, sister of Esteban, close friend of Romualdos,... the youngest son of the Vidal del Cerro clan, which was related to the lzaguirres, yes, the ones who used to own land in Baradero. It seems things didnt go so well, so, what did the guys do?
Cute they aint, good they aint, Nomoth, Nomoth, Nomoth teaches moths restraint. Spread Nomoth wherever you find em, Nomoth, Nomoth will make moths faint. I bet these ones wont feel like eating any more clothes. Oh, you think youre so smart!
In that case, lady, keep your calm, change your baby for another. In any case, one must be careful with infant diarrhea, one must take certain precautions because it leaves a stain. And now I will teach you a song for you to sing to your tiny ones, the "Song for Moving," to stimulate them to be agile, happy, healthy, er... and ... agile. To this end, I already leave you in the company of the musical group "The Little Mushrooms." Not fungus, the mushrooms that grow in the soil, okay?
I was born in Africa, thats why my skin is black. My name is Oblongo, which in a Swahili dialect means: "longer than it is wide-o." I know every tree in this forest, every path in my village, all the stories of its people... Some stories! I can tell the difference between the track of a gray Nigerian elephant with three men on its back, from the tracks of a pelican.
When I commanded the Rycon and 600 fighting ships, that's when I commanded a fleet. I was thinking of our present situation, sir. This collection of moving derelicts isn't a fleet, it's a convoy. A convoy held together by mutual dependence. A fleet is held together by force and discipline.
We'll make a guess. Plot a point where we might intercept the Celestra at an angle. Assuming they're moving at top speed... Factor four. Assuming they're at factor four, the computer should tell us where they are.

Dr Macon, team archaeologist. - Doctor. - How do you do? Anybody know what's going on around here? Zantia's always avoided outworlders.
Your grudge is with me. Our grudge is with whomever we please. And if the possibility of us murdering innocent people upsets you, Colonel, all the better. You're criminals. You were smuggling contraband three years ago.
Then forget it. Corliss would cut you to pieces. (Roxanne) How much longer? They've started loading the gas into the missiles. They'll be ready in 48 hours.
- A chemical, that's all. It will act upon the thalmic regions of your brain. But don't worry. While it will cause a great deal of pain, it won't do any physical damage. All right, all right.
Why do all the good-looking ones have to be crazy? The plant is only a few kilometres away. We'll land behind the rock formations at its northern perimeter. Won't be long now. (Kellogg) Clever, very clever.
How bad is the damage? Magnetic bottles eroding. Got to get them back to full strength before a chain reaction. - Good Lord. - No, he tried to stop them.
I love it. Michael, are you sure? It's gonna mean an hours train ride every morning for you to the city. It is what you wanted. Honey, we both have to want this. If you want to live in the Taj Mahal, that's fine with me.
I knew what I had to do. I even took a pistol with me in order to stop it but at that moment I had no intention of stopping it. I hid behind a tree and I watched them as they walk off the distance. There would be no chance of David surviving for if my father missed I would not.
You said a broad does it for money. You said a hooker sells it. I said so does a broad. If a broad is a woman, then women screw for money? - Some women! - Broads!
Such as marriage, for instance. Right on, George. I think I'm fairly well psychologically oriented. I've talked to psychologists, psychiatrists welfare workers... But when I drove by your church today, I thought, "God!
- Good. Let's get rid of it. Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time we've encountered a species like this. It has to go back. All sorts of tests have to be made. Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid.
The empty lots! The inhuman world around us! The monstrous, soulless city! I want to see trees. I want to hear birds. That's why I kill lonely women!
Anyhow, we all go the same way. It's the only thing we're sure about. The problem is to know how soon... You again! I'm worried, my wife's not home.
You're dressed like a teacher. You brought the kids here. If you try being witty, you'll make things even worse. Don't you know this is a dangerous place? There are gas leaks, explosions. Why, isn't it dangerous for men, as well?
- Don't worry. There's the sea here. Gianluigi. Why don't you roll out your sleeping bag? Look, everyone rolled out theirs. The frog. Come on.
And power is what it's all about. This 800 megawatt plant makes enough electricity for a city of 750,000 people. We're now 50 feet above the turbine room on an incredible moving crane. What is this crane used for? We use it to transport heavy pieces of machinery, hundreds of tons.
Open the case and turn your back! You can close it again now. I can't read clearly with one eye. Must I charge for 23 or 32 km? Have you noticed how tiny the lavatories are?
It was almost too tight for Karl the last time he was here, in May '41. The men still looked like men then. Now they all look as if they'd shrunk. You can take the underpants. They're warm.
With all respect, sir, Mrs. Braun has absolutely no experience in our field. Then she's about to gain some. Maria Braun, you have rendered outstanding services to the firm. Come on, Senkenberg, you too!
- No, just my hands. Hummingbirds. - Thinking of a job, then? - I may have one or two little things. Those one or two little things...
"I'm as important as your work." Is there another guy? I don't think so. She's not the type. She's got this friend, Margaret, downstairs you know, women's lib.
Yeah. What time? - About 7:30. - Can you hear the bells from here? Of course.
- What's wrong? - Nothing. Something's wrong. What is it? It's hard to have a good time, knowing my parents might be worried.
It's hard to have a good time, knowing my parents might be worried. Why would they be worried about you? They think you're in Mont-Saint-Michel on a field trip for three days. Don't they? So?
Houston is so... Houston. Until about 500 B.C., the Greeks perfected their carving techniques. You can see these statues are different from those Egyptian statues in their depiction of the human form. Praxiteles, for example, is a master.
- Of course it is! You read about them. You're doing nothing! It is a classic case, like in one of my movies. This is life imitating art.

I'll pick up something later. That Code 3 you ran down a few days ago... - The Nightrider? - The Nightrider, yeah. - Got a problem. - What's that? His friends.
Sure, a couple with a kid. I was just fixing their tire. They left their goddamn spare. - Who are they? - A couple passing through.
- What's wrong? Just take my word for it, get in! - What about the tire? Crazy people! The world's full of crazy people.
Ana, come, we know the way. What a joy to see you again. Mother is turning 100? It's amazing, she'll bury us all. It's unbelievable!
Ana, please, I'm cold. Dammit. Shit. You scared me. Something in there interests you?
Come, come in! Don't worry! Natalia is taking a shower, and Antonio sleeps like an idiot. Lock the door. And fetch the box with my medicines in it.
The satellites are orbiting with Earth 22,500 miles out in space. Since they are in different orbits, and in order for them to reach the target together, they will have to be fired at different times. Peter the Great first, and then 40 minutes later, Hercules. Two hours after that, they will explode at a designated distance from the target. Can anything go wrong?
Your husband's condition has worn you out. No, Dr. Van Helsing. Tonight. I need to study this matter scientifically. No! Tonight! There's no time to lose. Even a farmer knows that there's a time to plant and a time to sow.
On Monday I'm going to Puglia. I'll come by San Gimignano and say goodbye to you. Leonardo how could I write to you that this valley reappear to me as a symbol of happiness? How could I say that this meadow is beautiful? These flowers sucked by the beesÉ
I also knew I had never studied music Yet, when half asleep, I thought I had sensed what it means to conduct an orchestra, Today I know that that night, the hunt, my arrival to the country, that my entire life so far was a waste of time, a temporary waiting, a preparation even, for my meeting with Eugenia, All children are invited to come with us to the abandoned house of Marzana. There, our studio is set up, where children are preparing the staging of a fairy tale. The performance we have chosen is the "Pied Piper".
" -How ungrateful" cried the piper. She was crying and vanished. As the solemn cortege exited from the court, something strange happened. The sound of the flute was again to be heard on the square. King, Bishop, courtiers, the whole village could not help but to dance frenetically.
Hello. -Hello. But it is embarrassing! Why? I'll bring the sofa in order.
I wanna talk to my husband for one second. - Can I talk to you? - Sure. I got no appointments. Rocky, you are making this man's job very easy.
It didn't show me much, not much at all. You think I'm kidding you, don't you? I kind of hope so. This world's too full of bull already. Now, understand me. I don't begrudge anybody their due, I'd just appreciate it if you didn't record any more of my tunes.
- A month. Transferred from Dover. - A nuisance? - No. Told 'em I was Christ. Some cunning bastard had the typical flash of genius, and they bang me in here.
- I said right? - Right. Pongo Banks, the daddy. - Yeah, Carlin. Your reputation was here well ahead of you, and you're gonna have a little weeny bit of bother with that young man.
"Anyway, your dad will decide and find homes for them. You'll still have Bessie when you come home, but we can't hang on to the pups forever, since we don't know when you'll be coming home. So, we hope this finds you as it leaves us, Donald. Let us know how you are getting on, and be a good lad. Have to dash to catch the post. Love from Mum and Dad."

Right? I said, right? Yes, sir. On your way. Three she had, three puppies.
On your way. Three she had, three puppies. Well, me mum says she doesn't know whether they can afford them. You know, sir, feeding them and all that. Well, I want to find homes for them, sir.
- Well, lad? - Nothing, sir. Nothing. I fell, sir. Well, fall back onto your feet. This isn't Kew Gardens, laddie. On your feet.
However, I can understand the officer thinking I had by the state of my face. So, I've got no excuse really, sir. I mean, what else could he think? - C of E, are we? - Oh, yes, sir. My religion is a great comfort to me. Good.
The Creator has not responded. All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative! Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding toward equidistant positions, orbiting the planet. They're the same things that hit us. They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain.
See that dude with the skates? Over there. He's after you. He's got others with him. I know they're on my ass.
We're going back. How? Fuckin'Coney Island must be fifty to a hundred miles from here. It's our only choice. Real simple. Except every cop in the city's lookin'to bust our heads. There's something else to think about.
"Do you think I should neck or not? "I shall not enter the kingdom of heaven anyway... so I don't see what difference it makes. " - Listen here.

Well, just look at 'im. He acts like he thinks he's as good as me or you. just like some niggers I've seen. Shoot! I had a face like that, I'd put a paper ban on it. Look. I'm lookin' for that blind preacher named Hawks.
just like some niggers I've seen. Shoot! I had a face like that, I'd put a paper ban on it. Look. I'm lookin' for that blind preacher named Hawks. Now, do you know where they live? - Hawks. Yeah, him and his girl.
I don't wanna wake the old guard. He ain't very friendly with me. You see that there notice? It says he was once as tall as you or me. Some A-rabs done it to him in six months.
Saving youself... ... and others in the process. There aren't many of them but they're best. Nothing but fear and falsehood around us... I protected you against it all. I suppose so.
Three pupils: Durski, Sviestek, ... Zylski. The police chief inspector wants to see you. Sit down. You must understand dear fellows that there are things that grieve me much.
I know. He hates me... - ...because you are wise. Because you are good. So when I'm gone, watch out for Macro. I've taken my precautions, Caesar.
And that's a bargain, because most of the... women here are respectable, married ladies. Senators' wives. Whores of plainest reputation. I'll have to work out a special rate for you. Greetings. Flavia, come. Don't waste time.
Will be gra... gr... Will be, Grandfather? Would be, if you were not my heir. When Rome was just a city and we were... just citizens, we're known to one another. And we were frugal, good, disciplined and dignified. The Romans I rule are not like we were.
Chaerea. I hear you have a taste for little boys. Is that not so? - No, Caesar. Big boys. My soldiers.
Come on ... Listen ... if you really want to do something tonight ... You have something we can do, and is not the movies, you know? Guess I have for tonight. Two ... two girls really. And let me tell you they are dynamite.
Then I went into towns and cities within a hundred-mile radius, and four out of five had been empty for a thousand years or more, but the fifth one always contained the same things... bodies. Can you tell what they died of? You won't believe this, but as near as I could figure, they probably died of chicken pox. Chicken pox? Only it did things to the Martians it never did to people on Earth.
Sir is it possible we went through a space warp or something and landed on Earth as it was 21 years ago? We're not on Earth. The air's too thin. You're right. It's got to be that space travel started long before we think it did.
Is this the way it's going to be? It was only then that Colonel Wilder fully realized what was going to happen. Men would come to the new frontier. They would come because they were afraid or unafraid. because they were happy or unhappy. They would come with small dreams or large dreams or no dreams at all.
I've had more than my fill of him! But what did my mother look like? I cannot imagine that! I bet she had eyes like a doe, all lovely and shining but much more beautiful! But when she gave birth to me why did she have to die?
Birds look after their fledglings, they feed them in the nest until they are ready to fly. The love they feel is the love you feel for the selfless care I give you. That must be it! Well, Mime, if you're so clever, then tell me one last thing! In springtime, when the birds were singing and calling to one another,
The love they feel is the love you feel for the selfless care I give you. That must be it! Well, Mime, if you're so clever, then tell me one last thing! In springtime, when the birds were singing and calling to one another, you told me yourself when I asked you that they were males and females.
Are you saying you made me without a mother? I've told you the facts, so believe what I say. I'm your father and mother, all in one! That's a lie, you evil wretch! Youngsters always look like their parents. That's one thing I've learned for myself. When I looked down into the clear waters of the stream
I stand here shamed by your knowing silence. You wait, but I've nothing to say. Oh, well! Then listen to my horn instead. That stupid pipe is no good for the job. I offer you a woodland tune instead, of the cheerful kind I know best.
- You thought me stupid? - Now you lie here in your own lather! How do you like my crafty plan? Have I got my head out of the noose? Soon I shall wield you as my own! A stream of fire flowed into the water, how it hissed in its raging wrath!
- Right. Hang on. Bomb away. This one's gonna hit! (Buck) Where are Roxanne and Corliss?
This one of singular and unmistakable purpose. The deliberate arrangement of three great stone slabs allows a sliver of sunlight to pierce the heart of a carved spiral only at noon on the longest day of the year. The wind whips through the canyons here in the American Southwest and there's no one to hear it but us. A reminder of the 40,000 generations of thinking men and women who preceded us about whom we know next to nothing upon whom our society is based. When our prehistoric ancestors studied the sky after sunset they observed that some of the stars were not fixed with respect to the constant pattern of the constellations.
Months later, in some desperation he tried the formula for the first time for an ellipse. The ellipse matched the observations of Tycho beautifully. In such an orbit, the sun isn't at the center. It is offset. It's at one focus of the ellipse.
The ellipse matched the observations of Tycho beautifully. In such an orbit, the sun isn't at the center. It is offset. It's at one focus of the ellipse. When a given planet is at the far point in its orbit from the sun it goes more slowly.
In fact, the distance from the Earth to the center of the Milky Way galaxy is 30,000 light-years. From our galaxy to the nearest spiral galaxy like our own called M31 and which is also within, that means behind the constellation Andromeda is 2 million light-years. When the light we see today from M31 left on its journey for Earth there were no human beings although our ancestors were nicely evolving and very rapidly, to our present form. There are much greater distances in astronomy. The distance from the Earth to the most distant quasars is 8 or 10 billion light-years.
But it's not his fault he was trapped in the 15th century. A somewhat similar case occurred in 1939 when a group of engineers called the British Interplanetary Society decided to design a ship which would carry people to the moon. Now, it was by no means the same design as the Apollo ship which actually took people to the moon years later. But that design suggested that a mission to the moon might one day be a practical engineering possibility. Today we have preliminary designs of ships which will take people to the stars.
And had events been a little different those branches might have led to the dominant form today. For 40 million years, a visitor would not have been impressed by these timid little creatures but they led to all the familiar mammals of today. And that includes the primates. About 20 million years ago, a space time traveler might have recognized these guys as promising bright, quick, agile, sociable, curious. Their ancestors were once atoms made in stars then simple molecules, single cells polyps stuck to the ocean floor fish, amphibians, reptiles, shrews.

But then they came down from the trees and stood upright.
"Do light waves move relative to something else? And if so," he wondered, "relative to what?" That teenage dropout's name was Albert Einstein. And his ruminations changed the world. He had been fascinated by Bernstein's 1869 People's Book of Natural Science.
Or perhaps some safe means of human hibernation might be found so that space travelers might be frozen and then thawed out when they arrive at the destination centuries later. But fast interstellar space flight approaching the speed of light is much more difficult. That's an objective not for a hundred years but for a thousand or for 10 thousand but it also is possible. A kind of interstellar ramjet has been proposed which scoops up the hydrogen atoms which float between the stars accelerates them into an engine and spits them out the back. But in deep space, there is one atom for every 10 cubic centimeters of space.
The search for who we are. All living things on Earth are made of organic molecules a complex microscopic architecture built around atoms of carbon. In the great dark between the stars there also are organic molecules in immense clouds of gas and dust. Inside such clouds there are batches of new worlds just forming. Their surfaces are very likely covered with organic molecules.

In the great dark between the stars there also are organic molecules in immense clouds of gas and dust. Inside such clouds there are batches of new worlds just forming. Their surfaces are very likely covered with organic molecules. These molecules almost certainly are not made by life although they are the stuff of life.
From this chemical reaction, we extract the energy which makes us go. In the process, we exhale carbon dioxide which the plants then use to make more carbohydrates. What a marvelous cooperative arrangement. Plants and animals each using the other's waste gases the whole cycle powered by abundant sunlight. But there would be carbon dioxide in the air even if there were no animals.
Too much clotting and your blood stream will solidify. Too little clotting and you'll bleed to death from the merest scratch. The balance is controlled by enzymes instructed by DNA. Down here, there's also a kind of sanitation squad surrounds invading bacteria and ravenously consumes them. This mopping-up operation is a part of the healing process again controlled by DNA.
And we're made of trillions of cells. We are, each of us, a multitude. Within us is a little universe. Human DNA is a coiled ladder a billion nucleotides long. Many possible combinations of nucleotides are nonsense.
Recently, we've learned more about the origin of life. Do you remember RNA that nucleic acid that our cells use as messengers carrying the genetic information out of the cell nucleus? Well, it's been found that RNA, like protein can control chemical reactions as well as reproduce itself, which proteins can't do. Many scientists now wonder if the first life on Earth was an RNA molecule. It now seems feasible that key molecular building blocks for the origin of life, fell out of the skies 4 billion years ago.
The Heike all but vanished from history. Only 43 Heike survived, all women. These former ladies-in-waiting of the Imperial Court were reduced to selling flowers and other favors to the fishermen near the scene of the battle. These women and their offspring by the fishermen established a festival to commemorate the battle. To this day, every year, on the 24th of April their descendants proceed to the Akama shrine which contains the mausoleum of the drowned 7-year-old emperor, Antoku.
As the hours crept towards midday the sun's rays would slither down the sides of a deep well which on other days would remain in shadow. And then, precisely at noon columns would cast no shadows. And the sun would shine directly down into the water of the well. At that moment the sun was exactly overhead. It was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored. Sticks, shadows, reflections in wells the position of the sun simple, everyday matters.
I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky. We're about to begin a journey through the cosmos. We'll encounter galaxies and suns and planets life and consciousness... Worlds of ice and stars of diamond. Atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms. But it's also a story of our own planet and the plants and animals that share it with us. And it's a story about us: How we achieved our present understanding of the cosmos how the cosmos has shaped our evolution and our culture and what our fate may be.
Not one of them has calm, clear eyes. One man is wretched because he has to go to the office every day, another one is sighing because this happiness has been denied him. That's their ideal, their aim in life. So you don't want to go to the office and sit in waiting-rooms? No, and I don't want your social life either.
That's their ideal, their aim in life. So you don't want to go to the office and sit in waiting-rooms? No, and I don't want your social life either. To admire the symmetrical way the guests are seated, how quiet and thoughtful they are at the card-tables. A splendid example for a mind that wants something to stir it!
- Which letter? You took it from the postman. A dirty letter. How should I know where you put it? You never know anything.
But soon, we gained their trust. It'll help you better prepare storing foods for the up and coming monsoon months. Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This two-quart "Seals-M-Rite" container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days. These people had been completely isolated from civilization.
Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This two-quart "Seals-M-Rite" container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days. These people had been completely isolated from civilization. No one had outlined a physical fitness program for them, and they had no athletic equipment. I started them on simple calisthenics, worked up to rudimentary game skills, and finally, advanced competitive theory.
It's a big, pretty white plane with red stripes, curtains and wheels. It looks like a big tylenol. OK, boys. Let's get some pictures. This bulletin just handed to me. Stricken airliner approaching Chicago...
Are they safe? The mushrooms are almost certainly amanita muscaria a very powerful psychedelic and a little dangerous. It contains belladonna, alkaloids atropine, scopolamine. The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded among a number of Indian tribes. I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.
And one by one, up went mostly monstrosities. But that one building remained. It was there. Someone said an eccentric millionaire owned it. At night, as a kid, when I'd walk across the park, I'd use it to guide me.
- ...clothing business- - Lumber business? Take that cake. Now, the point ain't whether you like prune. - It's the thought that counts. - Exactly.
That truck out there, you don't know anything about that either, I suppose. Looked like a free-worlder. Now, what are these? I don't know. Shacks.
Gentlemen, Jesus come over down to my bunk here, Tuesday a week. And he hovered up there, kind of hovered. You know what he said? - What'd he say? - Say what? "Frank, many is called, but damn few is chosen. I'm gonna put you on my first team.
- ...or the state or a governor. - May I butt in a second? Let the record show that State Senator Charles Hite desires to comment. Mr. Brubaker, I think you owe it to yourself to face some hard facts. The people in this state have got themselves a whole lot of problems getting jobs, paying rent, insurance premiums.
I'm just interested in what works. There's no way to beat guys like that. You can't toe the line because it keeps changing. You have to be smarter than they are. I've locked the goddamn keys in the car.

For the first time, it's occurring to those prisoners that they don't have to take everything shoved at them, because they're still human beings.
For the first time, it's occurring to those prisoners that they don't have to take everything shoved at them, because they're still human beings. So maybe someday, when they do get out they won't rape John Deach's daughter or murder his son. Bravo, but you're full of shit. Just not enough to make things work in that prison. - The real problem is out here.
But I don't know. I guess a house was meant to be lived in. Why hasn't it been lived in? I've only been with the Society for a year now. The impression I get is they haven't tried very hard with this place.
Listen, it's note for note. Same tempo, even the same key. What do you think? I don't know. It's a startling coincidence.
What makes me different? I read the same papers. I even went to the same school as you! They'll come down hard on me. Won't you rally round? No.
Mother wants you to administer Extreme Unction. It's been renamed Anointing of the Sick. So even the Church is afraid to evoke the image of death. Can she understand what people say? I would think so.
On the long drives to distant jazz clubs, Starling kept an eagle eye on the fields looking for scarecrows, the only site to be buried in if a VUE victim wished to terminate a relationship with birds. She likes to go swimming down in Abersoch Bay She goes to the eisteddfod and she stays wide awake Ipson and Pulat Fallari were brothers in fiction and half-brothers in fact, or, thanks to Tulse Luper, maybe the other way around.
She refused to visit the site of her lightning strike, though her sons occasionally made the pilgrimage. Rapid conifer growth and the cutting of firebreaks have increasingly made the local geography unfamiliar. Pernicious inclusion of fictional character. Criminal charge pending. At an open-air concert at Phoenix, Arizona,
Both these facts improved his standard of living further. The first because he could rely less on observation and the second because he was forced to keep reinventing. ...a bird scarer. The conventional sanctuary... Fallvo's circle of contacts and clients continued to increase.
She went walking at night. The persecution ended tragically, for her body was eventually discovered in a boat-and-tackle hut at Teignmouth. It was difficult to establish foul play, so the verdict was ascribed to delayed effects of the Violent Unknown Event. This one. The next two biographies have been blue-pencilled by the Bird Foundation Industries.
The Mongolians came into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. They swarmed into my office still wearing their white winter uniforms in May. They kept flushing my toilet over and over. Can you believe? The German nation defeated by men who have never seen a toilet.
Why...? Why all the masquerade? Well, let's see. All right. I think you deserve some answers. I'll give you the 98-cent tour.
- That's all I've got to say. - One more question, if we may. The goddamn press. Okay, fellas, where were we? Like I said, the weapon was a.22 automatic but they found a voodoo doll on top of Tommy's body.
Sorry, sir. We've just picked up a submarine distress signal. Sir, they're on their way here and they ask permission to disembark. Palmer Station? -No, sir, the Soviet Station.
Well... Out here is the Baltimore Canyon... where offshore oil drilling has recently started. In my field of earthquake prediction, I became extremely interested... in this situation. -But, that is not an earthquake prone area. You're right, captain Lopez.
There is not a vaccine in the world that can stop it. Not liked it to be one, either. At extremely low temperatures the virus is completely dormant. But at minus 10 degrees Centigrade, it begins to reproduce itself. By minus 3 degrees Centigrades, its reproductive rate is increased by a factor of 100.
You just have to keep away from the sharp end. Actually, a snake is very good. In fact, it's delicious. And the skin makes a fine pouch. They live in the vastness of the Kalahari in small family groups. One family of Bushmen might meet up with another once in a few years.
Come and give us petrol here. Did two jeeps pass here? Yes, sir. They took half my stock. They took a big can of petrol, and they made me to lie down. If you find them, ask them. They must pay me my money.
If you speak now, whatever you say will be taken down as evidence against you. And why are you so beautiful? I got to go to court. What did you do? The cops were here. They say they caught a little Bushman for stock theft.
- Are Bushmen good stalkers? - Best in the world. Let him have a look at them. Explain to him that the men with the guns are bad. We have to put them to sleep. He want to know how did those people get in there?
- Jack? - Hi there. The marines have landed. It's okay. You can all come out. All right, come on. Come on. You're safe now.
I'm not stupid. You've already told me. I wouldn't forget your orders. I'm rich and well respected. I'm even running for mayor. If people knew what I was doing, my reputation would be ruined.

I'll bring it in. Did you bring your whole library? The problem of the wayward intellectual: Balzac or Stendhal? Lenin or Trotsky?
Wlth no memory of what Is pleasant or unpleasant, there's no question of being happy, sad, anguished, norof being angry, or in love. We could almost say that a living creature is a memory which acts. Then a "third brain" is added to the two others. It's called the cerebral cortex.
norof being angry, or in love. We could almost say that a living creature is a memory which acts. Then a "third brain" is added to the two others. It's called the cerebral cortex. In humans, it has become highly developed.
Now... as you check out the swirling colors... notice how your heads become more and more mellow. Each word I say will take you farther and farther... into a radical hypno high! Heavier, but smoother than any trip you've ever had. You boys know about astral projection? All right now, by the time I count to 10... we're going to project you beyond Mars!
Well, in the old days, we couldn't afford an icebox. So Granny used to smoke everything. Chickens, rabbits, squirrels... eels, even frogs. If it didn't move fast enough... Granny smoked it.
Neutral territory. Portuguese colony. That's a bit tricky. Naturally. Also, our people aren't able to break the code.
We're just fine. But our telephones aren't doing too well. Are the lines down, by any chance? Over. Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over. Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over. Well, I wouldn't like to say.
One of them actually stole a pack of matches and tried to burn it down. But I corrected them, sir. And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty I corrected her. We have the Snowcat. If the weather breaks we might just be able to get down the mountain.
You're kidding! That's wonderful. Are you gonna ride in the rodeo? -Jesus says the rodeo is bullshit. -Why? How come?
Where could the Mother Superior be? She's certainly not in the cloister. Ever since she substituted our old Mother Superior, the gate of this convent has been wide open! The Devil himself could pass through it without any difficulty at all! Your accusations are serious.
The stench is more than I can stand! That's the odor of death, Father... Ego te absolvo in nomine patris et fili et spiritus sancti... If one day we have to leave each other... My life has meaning only when it's fed by your love...
- Can't we go now, Jan? - Sure we can, Ellie. Come on, Jan. Mike. There was a shadow of a triangle on this coffin when I came in. The same triangle that's on the window in my bedroom.

Sometimes... I hear someone whispering in the wind. Mrs Aylwood, what do you think happened to Karen? I think she's still out there. - What nonsense. - I told you there was a ghost.
I'll lay it on immediately. - Now what's the second reason? Since the helicopter brought three, it could take three people back, providing we can get them on board unseen. Ah yes. But which three? - Well, there are 8 women aboard.
Well, I've been connecting the switch we have here to a bomb in the hold, so that any time I want to, I can just blow this ship to kingdom come. Course, we'll go up with it, but that's one of the hazards, isn't it? No risk, no gain. This man's an expert. He's worked with demolition teams worldwide.
Harris will toss in the stun grenades and I'll kill the man at the switch. I go aboard "Esther"? - We both do. You in your official capacity and I as your flag lieutenant. And what makes you think that they'll allow us aboard?
Yeah, let's do that. I don't like the sound of your voice either. Trouble? Isn't there some way we can notify your men? Only by radio.
I didn't know they had females aboard. - Just 8 of us. Things are improving. A gigantic step backwards! This is King speaking.
The fire's almost gone out. No one's come back this after noon. It's the most disturbing. Sometimes I wonder, If I should keep the place open in all the winter Have the young ladies made dinner arrangements?
No. What's up, baby? Oh, nothing. Some guy selling shoelaces. -Good morning. -Good day to you. I have to buy some flowers, miss. But I'm not sure... I'm not quite sure what kind they should be.
And they condemned me for being in the wrong. Why are you looking at me like that? I haven't done anything. Nothing happened. -Trouble because of the swastika? -Yes. There were some guys I used to hang around with. Reds.
"The past keeps following you, driving you on and on, driving you someplace where there's no future." Do you understand? Yes, I understand you. What you need are carnations. -White carnations, sir. -White carnations?
The waters teemed with fish. Trees sprouted from the ground, and the animals played: the beasts of the earth, fish and birds. There was a rustling in one of the trees: a serpent. A serpent, a serpent stretched out its head. A serpent lived in paradise, more cunning than all the other beasts of the field.
Cold, but fresh! Who'd like to stand in a hallway now, be a street vendor with frozen toes? Loyal and true! It's good to be out of the parlor, not to have to hear the women shrieking. Here comes Franz Biberkopf, walking down the street!
People do the best they can. They've got kids at home, hungry mouths, gaping like birds' beaks. Open up and shut again. Excuse me, sir. I'm very sorry. It's just that the roofs might begin to shake, to swing and shake. They might slip down like sand, like a cap from your head.
-Here, you don't have any left. -Thanks. But I thought Greiner had made a deal with those guys. Yeah, but that was last night. Now he's decided to put one over on them.
The animal gasps dreadfully, as if it would suffocate, wheezing and rattling. When Job had lost everything, everything a person can lose, neither more nor less, he lay in a cabbage patch. Job, there you lie in a cabbage patch. Just far enough from the doghouse so that the watchdog can't bite you. You can hear its teeth gnashing. The dog barks, comes one step nearer.
'and he is forced to resort to astonishment.' Mice? ! Mind your head. E-Excuse the mess. Most unfortunate-a diode blew in one of the life support computers.
- Really? - Every time they give me an order, I want to jump on a table and scream. Yes, I can see that would be a problem. 'There are many problems connected with life, 'of which some of the most pressing are... 'Why are people born?
- Every time they give me an order, I want to jump on a table and scream. Yes, I can see that would be a problem. 'There are many problems connected with life, 'of which some of the most pressing are... 'Why are people born? 'Why do they die?
'At the very moment Arthur said: I seem to be having difficulty with MY lifestyle. 'a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum 'and carried his words far back in time 'across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy 'where strange and warlike beings 'were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. 'The two leaders were meeting for the last time. 'A silence fell across the conference table 'as the commander of the VI'hurgs, in his red jewelled battle shorts, 'gazed levelly at the G'Gugvunt leader squatting opposite him 'in a cloud of green, sweet-smelling steam 'and, with a million be-weaponed star cruisers
Get out! Anne! You beat me. Did I hurt you? No.
You're always annoyed. Try to be calm. You're barely awake. Stay in my shell, as usual. Doctors know how to check your blood pressure.
I sleep well though. I'm a selfish sleeper. Goodnight to you too. Either your house is leaning or the sea isn't straight! I believe it's the house.
Goodnight to you too. Either your house is leaning or the sea isn't straight! I believe it's the house. Sure it won't collapse on us? That's why I bought it.
The concerto he used to play brilliantly had not been done in Paris. "If my work is going well, I compose almost morning to night. Perhaps it's the wrong method. I write very quickly, this could be a problem, too. I want my music always to reach the public.
"Altovaya Sonata", became the only work Shostakovich was never to hear performed. In the late 1920's, he wrote an opera based on Gogol's "Nose". The opera was shown in the newly built House of Culture in Leningrad. Where is my nose, where is it? - I can't see it!
- Hmm. True. - Mayor, we have to fix that somehow. One Woman can't catch all the fish herself. Hey, there's some fresh-faced girls who are just getting back from Tokyo.
What's getting into the ship are holograms. They contain twice as much information as ours. Only intelligent creatures could create them. - You mean that... - Yes.
You are to be saved by Orion's Loop, as you call it. The Loop, is it the broco? No. It's an energy belt built by Diana's inhabitants. - Shall we meet them? - We're the guides on your way to them.
Your research has made a lot of things clearer. All the systems of protection are helpless against the unknown radiation. Its source is on Diana. We're processing the data. The Loop is a screen for holograms. The holograms without the wall are dangerous for man.
yes. tell ME something, mother. Is this your Way of finally saying you regret having cheated on My father? maybe. That's not an answer.
tell ME something, mother. Is this your Way of finally saying you regret having cheated on My father? maybe. That's not an answer. WEll, let's just say that maybe some women don't appreciate What they have until they lose it.
But when she came into my home to recover, suddenly I had a whole new chance. I could never even think of her ever leaving. Mr. Jackson, she really does care for you. There's absolutely nothing between us. Christie and Louise, where are they?
I could never even think of her ever leaving. Mr. Jackson, she really does care for you. There's absolutely nothing between us. Christie and Louise, where are they? Gone for a drive, I guess. Well, where'd they go for a drive?
But why's he cutting' out the middleman? He cutting' the middle out of the middleman. I never seen so much blood in my whole lite. I don't like this business. I loved show business.
I did arrange to meet you, Ned. But that all changed. You changed it. I fell in love with you. You never quit, do you? You just keep on coming. How can I prove it to you? Why don't you go down there and get them? The glasses, Matty.
Real good. Always starts hopping in weather like this. - When it's hot, people try to kill each other. I know some people who'll be dead if we don't get a break soon. We got more of everything bad since the wave started. It's that crisis atmosphere.
Who says so? Deserters can stay, for example. And with little children... they close an eye... then the parents may also stay, even if they aren't political refugees. You didn't say so before! Well, if you go running off!
Why can't we stay together? She'll say she's pregnant to avoid deportation. Judith! Where are we? We want the Marseille-Lisbon route.
Arrange that with the German authorities, they will look after you. Come on! Preserves. Is this yours? Rationed foods can't be exported. Sorry. Eat now, as much as you can.
But... - But what? You're always talking about how many women you've had. I don't want to be just another statistic. Karen, knock it off, will you?
This is Custao. Yes, Fernando talked. And I've got bad news for you. She's dead? It's as if she was.
Having some fun? Fun is what they'll get at the plant. If you want, take my umbrella. It's full of holes, but it'll do. Those guys make me laugh.
If you want, take my umbrella. It's full of holes, but it'll do. Those guys make me laugh. They always break the law, but when it's time for a raise... they quote the law to back themselves up. Better get ready.
It's full of holes, but it'll do. Those guys make me laugh. They always break the law, but when it's time for a raise... they quote the law to back themselves up. Better get ready. If they don't change their minds, I don't give two weeks... before they have one hell of a strike on their hands.

If they don't change their minds, I don't give two weeks... before they have one hell of a strike on their hands. Then, I'll see if they give the raise or not.
Upside down, my ass! Upside down, my ass! I'm better off than you! I see the shit we're in. And you say that we gotta see that shit flows.
You have no family ties, I believe, that confine you to Dorset. I have ties. To this French gentleman? Permit me to insist. These things are like wounds.
Bye. Lunch on Sunday. "Will Miss Sarah Woodruff urgently communicate her whereabouts... to Montague, Chancery Lane. " Yes, very well worth it, I should say. Now, Mr Smithson...
Nothing more. I saw all this within... five minutes of our meeting. Yet I stayed. I ate the supper that was served. I drank the wine. It did not intoxicate me.
You too Belmont. What, me too? Haven't you done enough, already? What is it? Have I got small pox or something? Look at those two-faced bastards!
The parklands, nettles, the ditch, the body... and the wood. Why is it that you never talked about the wood? And you, why can't you tell me what my wife said? There was dead leaves under the girl's shoes. dead leaves fall from trees.
"Freak"? Weird. Unusual. Sophie said, on TV, there was this hand and they sewed it back on this little boy. But you have to find the hand right away to do that. What happened to the hand?

- Here! - Here! - But what have I done? - Sorry. I wanted to teach you one of the most ancient customs of the Roman people.
- Stop! Great. Ms. Schult, you come up past the window. Barbara, can you put a lamp post here with a light to dazzle the audience? Then you come here. "I'm Widow Queck who hasn't paid the rent".
I sensed it in the seed of what can now be unfolded to the full. I also liked you in the play with Lotte Lindenthal. The ideal actress to portray the ideal German woman. What are we doing here? Why is he wasting his time with foreigners?
Everything in the hall must express what we talk about. Two policemen can patrol the rows and stare at the audience. An end to passive watching, actors and public isolated from each other. The public must play an active part. The days of the peepshow are over.
Excuse me. Excuse me. It's your own fault. You know that, don't you, TJ? Never said it wasn't.
Now it started 20 years ago. It was the night of the Valentine's Day dance at the Union Hall-- the biggest event of the year. It had been a tradition for over 100 years. Everybody was there, except for seven miners who were out at the Henniger Mine, five of them still down below. Two supervisors were waiting for the men to come up.
Dr. Webb, don't you understand what I'm saying? I had a dream and I remembered it. After all these years, the first night in that house, ...and I remembered my dream for the first time. Go on. I'm listening.
You'll tell us in the end, anyway. So talk! Okay, okay, I'll talk. It's like this I met two guys on the street. They asked me for a cigarette, and I gave 'em one. - Marijuana, right? - No, just a plain cigarette.
Okay, okay, I'll talk. It's like this I met two guys on the street. They asked me for a cigarette, and I gave 'em one. - Marijuana, right? - No, just a plain cigarette. Then they asked me if I'd ever been involved in a hold-up.

But you can go back and tell Mr. Waldo that I have changed my mind. I'm ready to offer him a swap... Conklin's life for the freedom of my men. All he's got to do is deliver my automobile... to the front door of this library. And when it's dark, my men will use it to get out of here.

There is underneath a phreatic layer... there's nothing like it in the whole region... When I think you got rid of your well for tap water I want to crawl out of my pants in reverse!

You can't even see the color of the floor tiles anymore! Now I won't allow you to speak like that! After all, I did bring you beautiful geraniums and beautiful petunias... From now on, you won't "arrange" me and no more chores either! All my life I've washed the sheets in the river, prepared the fridge...
You're not the type. What do you mean, I'm not the type? I've seen the kind of guys that enlist in the Army. I saw them when I was working on unemployment. They're like us.

Buckets. The night before my wedding and I'm in the middle of a sweat contest. Speaking of sweat, here's a little-known fact. Women have fewer sweat glands than men, but they're larger, more active. - The human body.
If anyone had told me a week ago that I would be doing this, I would have thought them insane. When Sam offered me the job, I laughed in his face. But then it occurred to me, here I am, I'm a student. Not just in an academic sense, but a student of life. And where better than here to study life in all its many facets?
ThE last time I took a swing at you, you said, "one punch per customer." WEll, if I catch you near My wife again, I'M only gonna need one. come off it, pal. You don't have a wife. You'vE got yourself a Carrington.

These fellows have a unique way of interpreting the law. You don't have to tell me about it, pal. I know all about these guys... and their boss, Judge Paxton. - Ain't that right, boys? - I wouldn't know about that.
You got a burr up your muffler? - I beg your pardon? - You ran through a posted intersection without stopping. - I don't wish to tell you your business, Officer... - Then don't.
This was the door. It was stuck. I couldn't get out. It was stuck that night. This is the girls' room. They're asleep right now and I don't wanna disturb them.
What kind of sick? Things have come to me... in the night. - Nightmares, you mean? Like nightmares. Exactly. I mean... Those people you saw in the house, they're psychologists, they're doctors.
Please eat them. Who in blazes asked you to go and bring me tomatoes? First of all, what makes you think that I'd want to eat anything brought by a cat? And besides, those tomatoes are from my garden. Look at that.
It's not just any tooth that will bite into my Sílvia. You have to be married, my child. Master Paio de Ayres will be fitting for you. He's rich, very rich, and feeble-minded. Perhaps settling into this new estate will not displease you.
All you want me around for is company. You want money for Rolling Stones this weekend? Have you no shame? I absolutely refuse to go running with you. Period. Is Gloria taking the kids?
We are not going to read it again. We've read through it 10 times! It makes no sense. It doesn't work! Did you hear it? Morris, you're screaming at me. Yes, I am screaming!
We've read through it 10 times! It makes no sense. It doesn't work! Did you hear it? Morris, you're screaming at me. Yes, I am screaming! I waited two weeks for a goddamn rewrite. And when I get it, it worsens the problem. No.
Don't be ridiculous. She can't possibly be aware-- We don't know enough about the human mind. None of us know enough... about what goes on inside the head, do we? -Or the heart, Mrs. Bates. -We have to face reality.
I did knock, but... I thought you'd like a cup of tea. Tea, yes. Thank you. You know I had the strangest dream. Oh, I hope the bed was not to blame.
- I don't want a government job. I've got to know things about the people I take on. I've got all quality girls here. See them pictures on the mantelpiece? All of them are young ladies from The Flag that married well.
- You'll ruin your shoes. - You should take them off. Oh, my God... What have I gotten myself into? The boys returned knowing they had enough frogs to bankroll a party of shocking proportions.
Doc just holed up in his house, biding time till the spring tide started so he could get more octopi. It didn't even cross his mind to call Ellen Sedgewick. And then there was Suzy. Using money she borrowed from Fauna, she bought $27 worth of household furnishings and building materials. When she moved this stuff into the Hediondo Cannery's old boiler, everyone assumed she was just going to store it there.
I don't want the crate. I want that shoe. I want to measure the bite marks. Then maybe we can figure out what we're dealing with here. We have to stop it! Two people are dead already! We have to....
Actually, we just got here. Well, we can take care of that. Just come with me. Stay here until I get back. These people are dry. Take care of them.
That's the beauty of it! You provided the final piece in thejigsaw puzzle yourself. The crate is at the bottom of Ryder's Quarry. I drove out there with the remains of three human beings. Well, two human beings and Wilma.

The scalpel is very sharp. Use discretion when you are cutting. There will be very little blood. There may be a few body fluids. As we get started with the dissection... - Ew! - ...remember that the... things that you are writing down...
Please understand. Who bought the ship? Who paid for the crew? It's my right to come with you. Molly, you can't leave the girls.
Because I want this whole damned ship to turn back. Don't mess with me. I'll do what I like around here. Just keep the engine running. Those bastards!
No gold, no rubber, no nothing. Only head hunters... The two rivers almost touch each other. What? How exact is this map? Is there anything more precise?
He's to go to the visitors' room. Bapu. You too? It seems less formal than Mahatma. Since your arrest, the riots have hardly stopped.
Mind your face. Tomorrow I'll tell you about my days in a police hospital. Come, come. Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
God save our noble King God save our King These men are contracted laborers. They belong in the mines. You put their comrades in jail.
But... God! You can be sure the British won't censor that. They'll put it on every street corner. People are aroused. They won't stop!
If you lift your bust over the ocean you'll see, my dear sir Brazil. Like a harp or a ham, with the Andes behind. Even birds have trouble in going over them. - The Sugar Loaf is artificial! - Mais quelle merveille!
Tell him to come up. No wait. I'll see him tomorrow at 3:30. My tea and toast! Your stockings are so sheer!
She hands you $100, maybe a little more. - Where's my coffee and doughnuts? - Junior's bringing it. - Well, what do you say, Red? - This woman, what does she get out of it?
"Once upon a time there was a country so far north it was further north... than the North Pole." Is this part of the same, uh, book? There's — No. Charles... wrote this. "It was further north than the Big Dipper. It was even further north than the Milky Way, and that's pretty far north."
But, Ambassador, my friends have talked to refugees... in the Swedish, Mexican and French embassies. However, the man they must see is here in your embassy. All these people have come here looking for protection. – I am responsible for their lives. – Oh, come on. Look at them.
Safe for the moment. Later, they'll be deported. – What about Paris? – He's not even close to getting out of here. Why does he talk?
"It's only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye." What is essential? The stuff you can't see. This is Charles's handwriting, isn't it?
My God, check Perryman. Five years of marriage, still in love. That's what life's all about. Hey, Seeger! Remember those bodacious tatas and her pal?
But I don't know anymore. Nine weeks just ain't long enough for a guy to fall in love with you. That doesn't justify trapping him or getting pregnant. I can't believe you'd think that. It's real backward.
You couldn't see it. But how come Grandpa isn't on television with Carol Anne? Some people believe that when people die... there's a wonderful light... as bright as the sun... but it doesn't hurt to look into it. All the answers to all the questions that you ever want to know... are inside that light. And when you walk to it, you become a part of it forever.

"The grass grows greener on every side." - That's the way I feel about it. - I can't tell one house from the other. I think you're right. But I think our construction standards are really very liberal.
Okay, sweetheart, when did you last see Nice Boy? What is it, you fellas all deaf or something? I've told you it was last Monday or Tuesday. I don't recall. He's out with a whore shacking up somewhere. I don't know what the hell girls see in that guy.
Okay? So we're back to square one. Well, we are and we're not. Because by wiping out Kalenda, who was really just a procurer, it tends to bring us back to- to my original idea... of a person who has to blame the rest of society for his own shortcomings. Let's say it's a woman.
A terrible process. That's lymphogranuloma. And here she lies with one parent off in Brazil. And the other, you say, pays the bills and never visits. No.
Just like that. Not that he said "quack, quack, quack," but that was the tone. And he made an appointment to meet her. Yeah, huh? How come you heard the phone call?
What are we killin' ourselves for? Just to find a formula to some ordinary plant fertilizer? "Ordinary"? Something extraordinary came out of the experiments already. Something that Holland or myself had absolutely no notion of. None.
They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it. Right, Mac? Do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair? Chariots Of The Gods, man. They practically own South America.
I know I'm human. And if you were all these Things, then you'd just attack me right now. So some of you are still human. This Thing doesn't want to show itself. It wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to.
And if you were all these Things, then you'd just attack me right now. So some of you are still human. This Thing doesn't want to show itself. It wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to. But it's vulnerable out in the open.
We didn't keep the car wash job for too long. We got fired. Actually, we didn't get fired. We got another job. The Arabs that owned the car wash also owned this nightclub.
That stupid idiot. No, stupid. Stop that! You stupid thing. You know, it's funny how things work out.
There's bugs under here! There's gum here, too. Never mind about those women. We have to find those two guys. They've disappeared.
I wish to land on your airport. 10-4? Watch where you're going! I know what I'm doing, relax. Straighten out this plane! Stupid plane!
Touch it a little, it moves. Land on to the ground there, on the runway. Hello, Las Vegas. I am going to land on your runway. This stupid plane.
I tried sniffing glue, kept getting the tube stuck in my nose. I tried smoking hash, but I couldn't light the corned beef. I'll do another for you. I just made a killing in the market: I shot my butcher.
I mean, it's just a part. I'm not that militant. Don't get me wrong. I'm all for equality. Women ought to be entitled to everything and all, et cetera.
She's married to John. - Oh, yeah. I did a thing about suicides of the American Indian. And nobody cared. Nobody showed. And I think the American Indian is as American as John and Ethel Barrymore and Donny and Marie Osmond.
Are you gay? In what sense? Just be honest with me. For once in your life tell the truth! Because these stories are very demeaning to me.
He and Injun Joe threw back a few too many. Hard liquor. They thought they saw this elk. They stalked it for a couple hours. They cornered it up against Charlie's barn.
You remember my pal and fellow Klan member, Clancy. Hi, how are you? Good to see you. The Klan really thanks you. Democrats don't normally support us in the open. We agreed to keep that under our hat, remember?
Come on over and meet the senator. Meet my friend Clarence. This is the senator. Photographer. Take a little picture.
Good night. Now listen. We all know that... in the long run, what we're doin' with this dog is proper. It's right. It's humane.
Four pounds. Effective range: 270 yards. Sky-light scope for night work. Makes killing a pleasure. Five thousand rifles.
And how are you going to kill your folks, miss? Poison. I can't stand blood. Why do you hate them? Oh, I don't.
Each an easily made, functional bomb. And each is a 10-kiloton weapon with a destructive force, Mr. President greater than the Hiroshima bomb. Primary targets, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. - Do the Israelis know? - Doubtful.
K- l-double-L him, by God. - By God, sir? - By executive action. Why is tomorrow so bloody important to Awad? Beats me.
- They cried. - Soap opera. Seventy thousand telegrams are raves. - Most of them sent by you. - The people need us.
If I don't follow something like this... I might as well go and grow watermelons! You have changed. You are capable of betrayal. Is it possible I was wrong about you? You abuse your position as journalist and grow addicted to risk.
Is it wrong to want to change that? When the killing starts, are you gonna be part of it? - Sometimes there's no other way. - Yeah, sure, Kumar. You must not ask anymore about the shipment.
Take it back. And tell those hens I want more god damn laying of eggs. I do you want, bozo? Geez, I'm going broke. What is it with these hens? They're not laying any eggs.
CAROL (VOICEOVER): Talk about Stooges. That's just what Bill was for his boss, Mr. Poulet. But I need more. Carol, I can improve egg production. I finally succeeded in altering the chickens genes. It's all in the genes!
OK, shithead. Show it, and we can all get back to work. Just a minute, Andrews. That's my prized Polish hen. You damage so much as one feather on that bird and-- Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. So did Mussolini, and look what happened to him.
Oh, so you're glad to leave me. You're not afraid of me, are you? I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again. Because I've got used to you. And I will soon have another set of people to dread.
Jane, 4 days ago, last Monday, a singular mood came over me. I was sitting in my room by the open window and there broke involuntarily from my lips the words "Jane..." "Jane, Jane, Jane." -You spoke the words aloud?
A love unattainable... forbidden forever: The Thorn Birds. Good day, Father de Bricassart. - Happy Christmas to you. - The same to you, Mrs. Smith. Why is it the roses here on Drogheda are always the loveliest to be found?
The rabbits tunnel under them... the kangas jump over them, the wild pigs charge right through them. Look at this hellish wasteland. A man would wonder anything could live. It's not like home. Home was just as green as anything.
You're growing up. Sorry your mom didn't explain all this to you. - She should have, you know. - You mean Mom does it, too? All healthy women do, Meggie.
I've seen to that. All I can say is, it looks like heaven to me. If your idea of heaven is hard work, you're right. But we Clearys know about hard work, don't we, sister? Not that it got us very far back in Ireland.
But I've heard the boys talking. - Isn't that right, Father? - Yes, but.... See, Meggie, it's very different with people. Or it should be.
Happy Christmas. Thank you. I'll take pleasure in riding him whenever I'm here... but I can't accept him as a gift. Why not? You accepted the car I gave you.
Were you making a nice dream? ls that it? Tell me about your dream. Since I arrived here I've made many dreams. Dreams that make me blush and that I had never made before.
Katsuzo... You let them go? In my opinion, that woman doesn't have three children to feed. Shall I send men to see if it's true. No, it's no use.
It's come to our attention that you've bribed servants in order to have access to the boy in secret. Herr Beethoven would not allow-- You are talking about my son. My son who I have not seen for a year. My son who's been taught to hate me.
And Malcolm Gerrie was the producer of The Tube which was a well-known rock show in the Northeast of England and he and Paul McGuinness became good friends and that's how it all happened in the first place, actually. And when I look at these pictures after all these years, it's quite amazing. I haven't seen some of these pictures for... well, since 1983. What a memoryl And what a concerti It was very, very nearly cancelled because the weather conditions were so absolutely appalling.
It was, relatively, a small venue. Now you're going to say, "No, there's more than that," but I think there was something in the 5,000 region. And when you talk about Wembley, you're looking at 90,000. And I mean, you know, the venue was full. It's a pilgrimage.
It's a pilgrimage. To reach that venue is a very, very long walk and those fans were virtually... When they went to the venue in the afternoon before the concert, they were pilgrims. That's all I can say about them. They just walked and walked and walked through the rain and the mist and were soaking wet when they got there. We, fortunately, had four wheels to get there with but 90% of the fans actually walked.

They just walked and walked and walked through the rain and the mist and were soaking wet when they got there. We, fortunately, had four wheels to get there with but 90% of the fans actually walked. And I think this is one of the reasons why Bono and the band, with hearts as big as theirs, decided they weren't going to let anybody down and come what may, they were going to play to those people who had taken the effort to actually get there,
It's not them and the audience, it's the band with the audience. When we decided to pick the crew for the concert, I actually took from, Newcastle, from The Tube, two cameramen and the guy that's taken this shot is one of them. And they were, if you like, two of the key cameramen. So I had one of my cameramen from Newcastle on Bono, which was that shot. And the other one was on the other side on Adam Clayton and they were actually the main cameras. Unfortunately, I never had a camera that was sort of dedicated to the drummer which, in today's terms, you would always have that.
What more could you wish for? And Bono's performance, electric. Bono's breath... All added every single part of this concert. The rough hand-held shots, the roughness, the rawness, the energy, you know, there's nothing perfect.
And Bono's performance, electric. Bono's breath... All added every single part of this concert. The rough hand-held shots, the roughness, the rawness, the energy, you know, there's nothing perfect. All these shots aren't beautiful, they're not perfect but, by God, they've got such a lot of emotion and energy.
OK, they're a bit wobbly, who cares? It's... That was how it was. Well, it's interesting... A number of years after I'd done this concert,
It's... That was how it was. Well, it's interesting... A number of years after I'd done this concert, I was in Australia, and U2 were playing in Australia and I was directing the Australian Music Awards and they were doing a concert.
Jools Holland and Paula Yates. And believe you me, it ran for five years and just about every single band on earth wanted to play The Tube from ZZ Top to Twisted Sister to Cliff Richard to Tina Turner to Elton John and back again and it was because of The Tube that my entire career was in music concerts and I have, a lot to thank The Tube for. The Tube was probably one of the most groundbreaking live television programs in the UK at the time. Bands who performed on The Tube...
And I know I'll get my old buddies, a couple of the old cameramen and Malcolm Gerrie, who were actually there, and Liz Treadway, there with me on the day and sit them down, and give them a nice big glass of champagne or wine, and say, "Well, this was history." And perhaps some chocolate cake. I think, prior to U2 playing this concert, the only way that the fans knew about them was from their radio plays. And I think that says a huge amount about the quality of the band.
And Barry Fey, the promoter, said, "You're all a part of historyl" And I can tell you, those words became very, very true. I think the most extraordinary thing about the concert, I have to say, was the fact that there was every chance it was going to be cancelled. This was... I mean this was the beginning of U2's very, very long journey to absolute fame.
Er, Mrs. Mrs. Never mind. Get on with it, Father, come on. But...
The Post Office is everybody's target. But when they want a letter fast, who do they come to? - Federal Express. - He's mine! Sit down!
I'm going to grab the first woman that comes by and I'm going to go crazy. Yeah, Carla, what is it? Nothing. It feels good to be finally rid of her. Let me have a soda.
I like it a lot. You know, you've made my life a living hell. I didn't want you to think it was easy. Let me just kick these things off the bed here. Put them in the other room.
That's the first person I ever met that was on the Titanic. - He survived the Titanic? - l forgot to ask. I would've loved to hear that story. I figured you'd heard it.
- Very funny. Stevie. The money in that briefcase is marked. It's illegal money. It's dirty. It comes from a man named Anthony Solan.
Now go on, go to sleep. - Good night, Estrella. - Good night, Milagros. Mom, those shoes are too tight. I said that in the store and you didn't listen.
Different from anyone I'd met before. That night we had to sleep in the same room. When does it start to get warm here, dear? Here it almost never gets warm. It doesn't?
Not always. Only if the tenants are nice. - Are you staying long? - I've only rented it for a month. Pity, you won't be staying long then. Musician?
Maybe we don't think about it because we're distracted by other things... Or perhaps because the sun cancels out the nightmares of the night. Who knows? But death is always watching us and it's only the darkness that can see it. - Are you trying to scare me? - No I just want you to get into the spirit of the film because the music is enormously important. It has to express the anxiety, the fear, the terror.
- How do I know? I knew a Linda, but it can't be the same one. Besides, it would be an incredible coincidence. - What do you know about this Linda? - I already told you...
I'm not kidding at all. I assure you I'll find out the truth. You're blocking the sun. Listen to me. You look so worried, my love.
Did you hear, what I just said? Let me tell you something about love. It has a voracious appetite. It eats everything. Friendship, family.
Serves you right, you smelly buggers. Or it could be a bowling alley. A guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley. How are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight? They could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean...
Well, put your arms down when you get to school. Hey, Flick! Wait up. So what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Picking goobers? Hey, listen, smart ass.
What's that over there behind the desk? Behind the desk, against the wall over there. Why don't you go check it out? What did we put over there, honey? Santa Claus probably put it.
I will. I love plants. Before I became a singer, I taught natural sciences. You don't look like you did. I don't like plants. They bore me.
I came here because I came, and I left because I left. I love all that I can, and keep walking that old path. I keep walking on that path, walking where I want to go. Nothing you say, Mother can make me change. Now everything is different.
Master, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have changed the eagle blood. How come Ken and JoJo are still not back yet? Of course the young ones will have a lot of fun outside. Where has it gone? What are you looking for?
Besides her amorous escapades! No... Tourists bring out the murderer in me! And your little cousin doesn't seem too fond of me. I think... she wanted me to fall in love with Pierre. The girls went to Mont St. Michel.
except in dreams, as girls do for a movie-star, a prince, an athlete, a face glimpsed and never seen again. But it wasn't love. I've probably set hearts aflame. But they belonged to people I didn't care about, so I never noticed. Men may have killed themselves over me! I hope not.
It might take me a couple of days to line up some first-class stuff. I gotta talk 'em into goin' for other guys. They're pretty loyal. - Oh, yeah. I can imagine.
Really? Tommy - you knew that. Some guy you don't know at summer camp. And you. Well, why are all these assholes talking about you like that?
Some guy you don't know at summer camp. And you. Well, why are all these assholes talking about you like that? Most guys are so desperate, they'll lie about anybody to make themselves look like studs. Didn't you ever brag about some girl you never really made it with?
- I get hot. Really hot. Be convincing, because they'll be lookin' for a trap. - You even gotta convince me. - Lover, I will be convincing.
So how'd you get the commissioners to go along? Old-fashioned horse trading. Some fellow commissioners have a re-zoning project on the line, and I'm the swing vote. I really don't give a damn if they get their re-zoning, but I can't let them know that. So I play hardball.
(French accent) And now, for the grand experiment. Oh, no. Oh, no. Wait a minute. As you know, I am the barf inspector.

Call a friend in town, I guess. See if somebody'll let me crash with them for the night. What about your parents? Uh, couldn't you stay with them? They're in Portland.
What Gus is saying here is that we've got to stick together on this. These tests were designed to decondition, to desensitize to adapt out fears. Since we have developed a fully automated vehicle all we seek from the occupants of the capsule is data. The so-called astronaut would merely be a redundant component. And here you can see these chimps are capable of many of the same tasks as men.
We haven't been too lucky with the Atlas rocket. Some say we haven't taken all the safety precautions we'd like to. Is this true? No, it's absolutely not true. The only critical point is the re-entry.
What's next, Ridley? It's called Sputnik. We know. Sit down. And as I was saying whoever controls the high ground of space will control the world.
I'll wait here. It shouldn't take long. Ok. Time step and the last chase, right? Right.
Nautilus, steam, sauna. You know, they're into that sort of thing out here. You just give them white teeth, a suntan, and some muscles, and bang! You're a hit. I saw a hot location on Santa Monica.
We've got a date. I'll see you 2:30, ok? He still had some crazy idea he could put it all back together again. He vacuumed the rug, he polished the vinyl, he cleaned the whole house. Detective: She arrived a little after noon.
Very tasty. - Where can I throw it away? - Give it to me. I'll throw it away. Where did you get that coat?
It suits you. Look. Some femme fatale. The lemon tree is fragile. A light wind could take it down.
Therefore, television is reality... and reality is less than television. Max. I'm so glad you came to me. I've been through it all myself, you see. Your reality is already half video hallucination.
Max... I would like you to try this on for size. I would like to use this machine to record one of your hallucinations now. Then I would like to take that tape back with me to home base for analysis. Do I get to keep the copyright?
I'll go first and see. Get in and let's be off. Horrible! Put down the lantern, I can't bear to look. He's cold. The hussars must have been here.
Here you are, see for yourself. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, it wanders over the desserts seeking the resting place and finds none. Then it says "I will go back to the home I left". And when he returns he finds it empty, swept and tidy.
You know very well what I have in mind. Tell me, doctor you have studied the secret arts... Can a dead person take over the body of someone alive and beautiful? For this you need no secret knowledge. The answer is in the Holy Bible. Here you are, see for yourself.

- Check Where it says "K zone". "Found a K zone completely free and unsuspected, ideal place..." It's an old theory going back to the turn of the century. A former student of mine, a Swiss scholar named Meyer, Wrote a thesis on it.
Go down, I want to see you dance! Attention! I'd like to present two great dance masters! They'll show you how you ought to dance This dance is meant to bring rain on the country
- See how humiliated it is! Don't you ever wash, boy? - You're having a bad time, eh? - We made it go down All animals on board suffer due to the pitch and roll
The overture of Barber of Seville gives me goose pimples! And that's Andromeda, and that small star on the right near Orion was discovered only 50 years ago Correct, Sir Reginald. You're giving a lesson in astronomy! That star is known as Cauda Pavonis
- You're in a mood One day she told me this: "You always talk of my voice, "but sometimes I'm almost sure it's not really mine "I'm a voice, "a diaphragm, breathing "I don't know where the voice comes from
Well? I want to know everything, every detail Did you spot him on the dock? - Be nice, Reginald I'm sleepy! - Oh, did you go too far?
- G. PETRlASHVlLl Chaanidze - - O. SHOTASHVlLl My dear Vaso, this picture has hung here since I remember myself. Yes, I know. But now you must put it somewhere else. It may fall down any minute.
No, no, the seams are intact. It was a false alarm. Strange... It was a very unusual sound. The ceiling has cracked. The ceiling has cracked!
I'll do my scientific best to command your fleet. And tomorrow, I'll destroy the rebels. Consider this an early retirement. -We're ready when you are. -Okay, come on.
These people who believed in him, he could explain it to them better than any politician could, what was goin' on politically, economically and culturally. There's a lot of folks in Jamaica who can't read. So therefore there's got to be some message sent to people that can understand what's going on in government and on the land. He was the one chosen to do that. When I stand up and I see the youth fighting against the youth for the politicians, then I really feel sick.
They feared he was leading Jamaica towards Castro and communism. But Manley and his aides recognised how useful reggae music could be in winning the Jamaican people to their cause. I think the politicians used reggae. Reggae, especially through people like Bob Marley, expressed the wishes and the sentiments of the people. Their protest came through music and the song, and they said what they disagreed with and what they agreed with.
It was in '76 that Bob really became a superstar in Europe and a household name in England. Suddenly you go from small island girl to being splashed all over the front page of every newspaper you get in London. And not Just that, but tied in with someone like Bob, who was a very controversial character. And they tended to highlight, of course, anything they thought was negative about his character and his personality. His habits, his wife, his liaisons with other women, whatever.
Too much of anything is not good, really. And so you find out with success and stardom, popularity, everybody was coming and the pressure... the pressure started. The pressure arises and it made a difference. He become very edgy, and his relaxation time was very minimal. His family time was very minimal. And then, you know, he was losing something.
Do they like you? Do you think any of the Rastas have been involved in the killings in Jamaica over the years or that's somebody else? To most people who are very conservative in dress, you look quite strange. Even if the ganja-smoking Marley, ripped out of his head most of the day, seems hard to take seriously, even though the temptation is to laugh at a stoned Jamaican musician who worships a dead Ethiopian dictator, Bob Marley's view of the plight of the black man is hard to knock.
And he had that sort of innate intelligence that, you know, you have to put in to take out. But if you grow up in an urban environment, the only thing between you and what you want is money. Anything you want is available immediately. To succeed in the cut-throat music business of the late '60s, Bob Marley knew he had to return to the Kingston studios and reflect the hard realities of street life in his songs.
I've got you, Horner, but I need that jewel. It's a bonny thing, just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course, it is a nucleus and focus of crime, every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
He obviously knows nothing of the matter. Ah, Mrs. Hudson. Watson, do you need nourishment? Not particularly. Splendid.
I was tortured. I tried to escape, I was tortured again. It was to be many a long year before I saw another white face. My captors fled north, further into the hills, and used me as a sort of slave. I was treated worse than a dog and they damn near broke every bone in my body.
Sometimes when we were discussing old campaigns, the premier, the Mutiny, Afghan War, the smile would often be struck from his mouth as if by some invisible hand. Yes, long service in India can have that effect. I saw that when I was in the Berkshires. You mentioned a carved wooden club found by the body, one of the Colonel's Indian souvenirs? I believe the servants deny ever having seen this club before.
Each time I saw it, I knew something was wrong. It lacked symmetry. There should have been six ballerinas, three on each side. But the sides were uneven because there were only five. Not only were Natalia and Alexander missing from the curtain call, but so was Irina.
See if these fibers match up with her sweater. Right. Sergeant, you might examine under her fingernails while you're at it. Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh. This investigation could be valuable material for a new mystery novel, eh, Mrs. Fletcher?
ToJerry? No way. It was Ross's project from day one untilJerry horned his way in, dragging little Eve behind him. It was a payoff, pure and simple. Ross had to give up his producer's credit or no Eve Crystal.
Oh, not that I know of. I suppose the police asked a lot of questions about the original costumes. They were only interested in seeing the new costumes. Mostly all I could show them were the sketches. You know, I'd be terribly interested to see those original costumes.
No, Elizabeth. Look, I'm not choosing to die. I'm choosing for you to live. You, your mother, and millions of people that thing out there might kill. But the hardest part is leaving you alone.
Put up a map of our landing zones. Overlay the Red Dust deployment areas. Add weather patterns and correlate. Of course. The Red Dust is a bacteria, and a sensitive one... apparently requiring a dormant stage to regenerate its life cycle.
It's already next time. Your transmission was interrupted or we would have been here sooner. What a primitive planet. We were afraid you might be dead by now. The Red Dust.
Humphrey! Good people of Lyonesse, your guardian is dying. And in my last act as your defender... I bring you my murderer. Kill him! Take this ring, quickly, the stone inside your hand.
- It's impossible! - Of course it is. The more you cheat, the harder it becomes. Cheat? What do you mean? You're not playing my game, GaWain.
I didn't say anything. I'm just thinking it. Are we almost there? I don't know. Soon I think.
- That's right. Was anything missing? I saw him take a credit card. Not a credit card, a card key. He used it to get into her house.
Five languages of your choice. She specializes in economics. Her father was a general. She came out of a concentration camp. Refugees are good staff.
He will decide. Yes, that's it. He will be the one to decide. - Have you heard the latest? - I'm up to my ears in it. Two theories, the optimistic one is that some anarchists are playing with fire.
- Motive? Anything. Is it necessary? - It's an order. - Is it? Is that all? No.
Aye, aye, sir. Right men! Food up! Hey, is it true what they say about Tahiti? You mean the women.
Right men! Food up! Hey, is it true what they say about Tahiti? You mean the women. Do they really go around with no clothes on?
Not sir? Not captain? William. I don't think the men will have it. Oh, the men won't have it.
- Possible. Blood starts to coagulate in four minutes. When I went to get the suitcase it was still fresh. - He could have been out there! - I couldn'tjust leave it there.
Berries! Don't stray from the path, girl! Did you not hear what I told you? Once you stray from the path you're lost entirely! The wild beasts know no mercy.
Look, Mummy. Take care, won't you? And take this. No. This is all these beasts understand.
Why can't Mommy grow roses like that? It's a question of a green thumb, she lacks that. No hand at pastry, either! Good morning, Father! Good morning!
Instead of continuing to rise it falls along the curve of the planet. Since the atmosphere would keep you from maintaining this speed you have to fly way up high and actually get out of it. When it's time to land, you simply skim the atmosphere and slow down. Just a moment's deceleration and back you fall to the ground. In short, we're working day and night to build the first machine designed to go up just so it can come down again.
But this is the style I want. Excuse me, sir, can I get some service? I'll be with you in a minute. We bought these shoes here and we'd like to exchange them. I can't take them. They're worn.
Now, why does that give me the chills? I've been afraid of something all night. You don't wanna spend the night alone. - Oh, clever. Very clever, Tony. - Hey, hey. Hey.
Priest found it when he opened up this morning. At least, what's left of it. Lost a lot of blood before it died. That's some baby. You guys ever see a baby like this?
We play games together I know a game too Run The ones on the boat are the High Consorts High Consorts? The wives of the Emperor before me
Get in I used to play a game with the Eunuchs... trying to guess who is who Now I cannot see you The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty The fire was a terrible disaster
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir. I'm afraid, however, that another problem exists. What is it? Explain. Hunsaker spoke to the police.
Now bury me...and pray for me. She was the best of all us... how she used to swim, to float. Everybody liked her. You might ask: "Why her?" And I tell you: because. I remember her most beautiful moments, the moments we spent together.
However, I see money... You've reassured me. There will be problems... You go from hot to cold, don't you? That's strange...
Normally, people say the opposite. We can only help those who have the strength to fight. Very enlightening! I'm not an intellectual, you know. With me, everything's from the heart.
I don't know anybody who's tried it. Why you wanna call the cops? Some guys at the beach stole my stuff. For real? Bummers.
And then, about a year later, my mother died. She used to tell me about the kahuna. Kahuna? Priest kings. The ancient Hawaiians.
Yeah. You know, I remember Chandler used to fight with my brothers all the time too. Anela, are you and Chandler happy? I mean, a haole surfer guy and a local woman living here? [Groans] Are you happy?
About Pipe? Yeah, you're not ready for it. I'm ready. Oh, yeah? Okay, brah.
I'm sorry, I can't. It's not yourfauIt. I'm a disaster in bed. I don't know why. I'm sorry. According to the legend, opera singers are incredibly horny!
-You have a beautiful voice. -Thank you. I watched that person trying to kill you tonight. Why do you come up here? - To get away when my parents fight.
-Yes, you! This isn't one of your crud movies! Birds on stage, bad projection! is this an opera or an amusement park? How can I sing with a raven on stage that hates me?
This isn't one of your crud movies! Birds on stage, bad projection! is this an opera or an amusement park? How can I sing with a raven on stage that hates me? - I can't imagine why it hates you. - Neither can I.
"Where the hell did everybody else go?" Sometimes I see them from afar, crossing the hills and descend towards the west They die going west Or they kill eachother for a little water The Black Jack on the Red Queen The Black Ace on three, this is how it has to be done Now I find myself kilometers away from home In a land that seems foreign to me and in a few minutes, I might wake up to find myself killed on the roadside Last spring, I felt very tired and I realized that I had started to get old
Trap in Phone booth registered to 33 confirmed" "Dead man with neck and hand wound, unknown executor and registration." Come to white Frequency. Circuit 33 is under surveilance. I'm listening.
No. That's one of ours. You sure? I don't think the Germans can get over here so easy. They can!
Little did I know. ...While I was on the scene? It's the Masked Avenger. It's off to jail for you. I hope you'll enjoy making license plates.
that's the price. I will do everything in my power to protect you from any injustice in the future. I promise to give you my first child. - Do you swear? - I swear.
You remember them. Whitman, Price and Haddad! There they are! And at this very moment... they're basking under the Maui sun... their debt to society... paid in full. Speaking of prizes,you don't have to be a menace to society to be a winner... 'cause you folks in the audience will get a chance too.
Americans love television. They wean their kids on it. They love game shows, they love wrestling. They love sports and violence. So what do we do?
Get him out of here! What's the matter? Steroids make you deaf? Get him out of here now! Now what?
- Look, not the suits. - What do you mean? - Excuse me, sir. - Good morning. - Look, not the suits, man.
Oh, come on, now. She'll be gone in a couple of days. Yeah, that's what you said last week. Time passes and she's still here. Oh, look at this. She will not stop picking the flowers, which I asked her please not to do.
Yeah. That's him. Jesus. He was in Continuation. He took a swing at one of his teachers. These guys aren't your average history types. They're like ex-cops.
Jerry. The book. Fine. The book. Honey Goes to Hollywood. It's a good read. Fast, angry, sexual.
This is the perfect place for an ambush. They come right out from under the sun. Right now, they could be here, hidding. Let's get out of here. Keep the horses quiet or I'll quiet them forever.
Keep the horses quiet or I'll quiet them forever. You sure they're coming? They will come. And if there is no gold? It's a stagecoach with escort.
Not yet. This is our next step. Miss Crawford, do you have any idea... how many towns in the old west... grew and disappeared out of nowhere? Yes, I know. But what can you tell me about the town in this photo?
I know it's true. But life has to start again. I want to focus on the handgun. Listen, thank you for what you are trying to do... but I'm happy as I am. I want to focus on the revolver.
They called out to me and every breeze incited mightily the agonising longing in me, and if I wanted still to tarry here a moment more, it would be as though the growing boy, already in his awkward years, still played the games of childhood. Soulless as a knave I drifted hereabout in night and shame before you and my gods. I've lived; as from the crowns of trees the pollen sprinkles downward and the golden fruit and flower and grain pour forth from darksome earth, thus came from toil and need my joy to me, and heaven's friendly forces then descended;
Where is he, then? Not far from here. There he sits in darkness, soulless. For the gods have robbed him of his force, ever since the day the man, besotted, in front of all the people recklessly proclaimed himself a god. The people are besotted, as is he himself.
When all is lost he takes it all back again, and this wild man no mortal can restrain in his wild ravings. And he will never be the tranquil one again. Old man! You do envisage nameless things Your word is true and when it is fulfilled then woe to you, dear Sicily, as lovely as you are with all your groves and temples. The gods' own words will strike him down before his ploys begin.
He kept it hushed, of course, his monstrous dark intent; But he is finished now. Despicable one! Did you imagine they would dance a jig when you of late and in their face announced yourself a god? You would have ruled in Agrigent, a tyrant solitary and omnipotent; and you alone would have possessed these good people, this fair land.
But he is finished now. Despicable one! Did you imagine they would dance a jig when you of late and in their face announced yourself a god? You would have ruled in Agrigent, a tyrant solitary and omnipotent; and you alone would have possessed these good people, this fair land. Yet they were silent, shocked;
Farewell! I've been too brusque in sending you away; farewell, my faithful friends! And you, paternal house, where I grew up and blossomed! —Beloved trees! Consecrated by my joyous hymns, I, the friend of gods, reposeful friends of my repose!
I'll drop upon my knees and plead with you if that will help. Becalm yourself. For we must leave now. Yet many things may change, Panthea. The people may regret their deed.
I'll hear no more. Have I deserved this? I can easily forgive your ill-timed reminders; it is but the priest who haunts your eye, and in your ear the rabble's mocking cry still rings, fraternal keen that kept us company as we abandoned our beloved city. Ha!
You shameless ones! Is this all you know to do? What do you want of me? You know me! You are the ones who branded me. Yet do the lifeless people want their persecution to be felt?
He looked upon us once with gentle eyes, this kinglike man; Woe! If only we were living still in Saturn's age, like those of old, thriving under friendly heights, and each found joy within his house and was satisfied. Why did you call upon our heads his inexorable curse, the curse he's laid on us, alas!
The gods once loved him overmuch. Yet he is not the first whom soon enough they thrust into the senseless night, cast down from heights of their familiarity because he proved forgetful of the difference in his extravagant delight, feeling for himself alone; so it went with him, he is now punished, in arid wastes abandoned— although the final hour for him has not yet come; whoever has for so long been their darling will not long bear the insult to his soul, I fear; his drowsy spirit will spark to flame anew to work out its revenge, and, half-roused, a fearsome dreamer speaks in him as once it spoke in those enthusiasts of old who wandered throughout Asia bearing reeds for staffs, whose word was how the gods first came to be.
Oh, come with me! You will not go alone. There is one still who honours you, although it is forbidden, dear friend! You know the blessing of a friend is mightier than any priest's most baneful curse. Oh, come with me to foreign shores!
What I have said while tarrying here is of little worth, yet may a ray of light illuminate your path and guide you downward to the silent source, that it may bless you as it permeates the twilit clouds. And may you then remember me! Blessed one! You've overcome me, holy man! I'll honour what befalls you, and I'll not give it a name.
You're damn right we're going to have a séance. Why? Just tell me why. Cos those two dead whores keep whispering to me. Here we go again. What do they say?
Why? Just tell me why. Cos those two dead whores keep whispering to me. Here we go again. What do they say? They say they're too old, baby.
More than anyone. I asked Spider to bury Patty and afterward I went to look at the grave. Patty's resting place looked a little too small. I realized that Spider had performed a decapitation. He wanted to stick you for the homicide, hit the narc for two million and move in on me.
Do you really want to get him? You see what I'm saying? - What are you prepared to do? - Everything within the law. And then what are you prepared to do? If you open the ball on these people, you must be prepared to go all the way.
Somebody steals from me, I'm gonna say 'you stole', not talk to him for spitting' on the sidewalk. You understand? Now, I have done nothing to hurt these people. But they're angered at me. So what do they do?
Back off, Fidel! Alex? -What a nice surprise. What the hell do you think you're doing? I said: "What the hell do you think you're doing?" A little housework.
We pack up. We get out tomorrow. - What are you doing? - I'm going for a slash. No, you're not.
Precisely the reason I'm smokin' it. I couldn't. I'm spaced. Not as spaced as your rodents. - Don't talk about them.
But my presence is a bad sign. My son Nyanankoro... The ancestral fetishes, the secrets of Bambara lore, he has taken them and fled the country. Did he come through here? Yes, with his mother.
Rise and be gone. Go away! A stranger has come into the village with two servants. We couldn't stop them. They're coming to you.
It said to me: "Djigui, the threat hovering over the Bambara will strike the country but spare your family." These words gave me hope. In the same dream I was also told this: "Your descendants will undergo a great change.
Then I could see only shadows. Then I could see only shadows. So I left the country, blind. Only your mother knows my story. Now that you have come to me, I entrust the Korê wing to you.
Glory to the Komo who knows all mysteries. Genius of the crossroads! Nialé, matron of the Komo, goddess of the night, spirit of the winds, do you hear the blacksmiths' songs? Chant the sacred songs. King of the blacksmiths, when the old goat dies, we shall die.
I observed, a living sun, with the same people... who won't let themselves be abused by arrogance... facing the end of a world... endlessly endless. I remember the words I would send to a shooting star. Balance and unbalance break the harmony of hope. I'm staying alone in the darkness, waiting for tomorrow to bring something new, but the spirit is getting tired with endlessly desiring the same thing, and the cycle perpetuates... like a slow death. Because I know that tomorrow, nothing is going happen.
But I shall hasten at dawn to break you asunder Oh, Leonora! What has happened? We found a gypsy woman lurking nearby Our scouts surprised her. She fled
You must know my nickname is 'the liar Chisa'. But a lot of people were listening. You shouldn't have mentioned my name. How stupid you are! Facts aren't interesting at all.
Then I'll listen to them silently. A cat may be better? No. A dog. A cat won't follow them.
A vibrator slowly... Ah! It's a snake! She's feeling good. The snake is... licking her.
Shall we go on a tour to her? A live tour, with the man and the Pirate equipment involved. You also watch your own house? Of course. I'm most in danger. The terminus of the tour will be my house.
You will make friends. You'll have teachers. You'll learn about the world, science. My dear child all these worries will go away. Do you remember my dear Neyir? Once Suzi had cologne called "Chypre"?
How? He hasn't told you to. He wanted to leave, didn't he? You wouldn't let him. That's what all the fighting was about, wasn't it?
You listen to me! No! You listen to me! Now, you can take me on anytime you want, but you interfere with my work with a patient, we'll see whose career is on the line. I'm not putting people in danger. And I'm not killing my patients.
No, no, but I did find someone who may be able to help us. Who? Dr. Carter. You know what I just realized? What?
I don't know anything about it. So what do you want from me? I want you to tell us how to get into that vault. I don't know how. Maybe I can shed a little light on the subject.
That was sort of between us while he was alive. Now there was a man with will and knowledge. When I was four years old, And I tripped over a rusty can and fell, The-the lid was bent up and caught me right under here. I ran up to him... Howling, blood just running down.
Well, maybe not for you, but for me. Hey, don't move. I don't want to hurt you more than I have to. See these needles? They're magic.
Oh, yeah. Angus mcbride? One and the same. He-he-he met his doom right out there. In 1720, the, uh, crew mutinied,
Angus mcbride? One and the same. He-he-he met his doom right out there. In 1720, the, uh, crew mutinied, And they set him adrift in a small boat.
Yes. As we stated in the letter, we'd be willing to buy it back. Uh, well I don't have it any more; I sold it. Hmm. Is there any chance you can get it back? Well, the man I sold it to died last year.
I was out for a, a... Well, actually I wanted to ask you A little more about the foghorn. Yeah, the foghorn might have sounded Last night, all right; it's on automatic. It works like a smoke detector.
"the santa ynez, laden with spanish gold, "went down with all hands, "off this coast, sunk by And, uh, See the mint registry? Identical. Yes, but... I can't get over the condition.
You're going to hire her? Please don't take this personally. Are you out of your mind? Don't take that personally either, sir. Before you accept this job, if you could just look at my three little girls here.
Oh, you little-- What are you doing here? What happened? All right, come on. This is a party. Why is everyone so quiet? They think you're cute.
Some of them good, some of them not so good. And you could never be sure which memory you were gonna come up with. The decisions we make shape our lives. When I was a kid, I made a bad decision about a gun and my life was never the same. Now I was back, 25 years later, to follow up on a promise.
- Dad said you were coming. - Danny? Wow, last time I saw you, you were a little kid. Sure, six years ago in L.A. I still remember that homemade volcano you showed me.
Emissions are down 18 percent. Engine's running 10 degrees cooler than we expected. - Great! - We haven't even opened her up yet. Well, I'd better give the Phoenix Board of Directors the good news.
And it's gonna be almost impossible to find out who. Maybe not. Hey, this ain't no open house here. We need some help. Join the club, man.
Row four, no stranger to the track here at Westwood Springs, Rick Payne, and of course Rick is in car number 15, and newcomer Todd Nicol in number 20. In row five, we have David Boyle in car number 34, and at the back door, number 99, the last-minute Phoenix entry, with MacGyver behind the wheel. Now, will they get a start? The field appears to be in nice formation.
I suppose you think I'm a crackpot too? No, I think you're a dedicated scientist who's gone too far. May I show you just how far I've gone? Please. This is what Dr Sandra Millhouse is all about.
Please. This is what Dr Sandra Millhouse is all about. Some day, soon, I'm going to be able to plant these trees in the Sahara, the Arctic, and they will still bear fruit. Heat, cold, pollution, they won't be a problem. And why?
My God. - Well, what does that mean? - They died of old age. Washington wants to discuss its disposition. Great, I guess this means we kill it, before we have a chance to understand.
Rocket! JATO. Jet Assisted Take-Off. The Vipers. The Vipers. Commander, we know their radio is working.
we are on our way. Three hours, eight miles. At the most, we've got five hours to get out of here. well, it's gonna take a lot more than a wing and a prayer to get airborne. I mean, look at my plane, Mac, look at it.
Al, do you know the difference between Steve's mother and a bowling ball? What? A bowling ball doesn't have a beard. It's one hair. One hair does not make a beard.
He didn't even apply for it. Yeah, he didn't ask for it. Hey, remember what Mrs. Rhoades said about those Yodelin' Andy records? If they send you something and you didn't order it, you can keep it, use it, and not pay. Oh, Al. Do you think we could?
- What? Pinky and smegging Perky? What use are they? It's like giving Blind Pew contact lenses. - They only do what you tell them to. - They don't.
- Have you seen your room? - What room? Mine is brilliant. I've got a vibrating waterbed in the shape of a guitar. Well, you should see my wardrobe.
Lt. Worf and I... detected the same scent... when we bumped into your son... at the holodeck. It's that smell. That's how the virus travels. An airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation.
Aim the shuttle at Relva! OK. - It's done. - Good. Now, monitor your speed exactly.
This gentleman here, the emissary of a foreign government, has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime. Damn. Haven't they invented the electric light by now? What, dear fellow? Pray continue, Inspector. To put the matter simply, this man was accosted by gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions.
Very impressive. - Your first visit to a holodeck? - With this level of sophistication. How does it work? London was hundreds of square kilometres large. This is no larger than the holodeck, so the computer places images of more distant perspective on the walls.
- No. You should be. Mr. Computer, the arch, please. A few more questions, Mr. Computer. I just can't seem to remember that last command.
Madam, I have enjoyed your company. Computer,... arch. Cancel override protocol. Return control of the holodeck to main computer. My fate is in your hands.
Could it be alive? How could it be alive? It's inorganic. Whatever it is, it could be what they are covering up. And the reason someone killed Malencon. Captain's log, supplemental. Data's startling discovery of a possible life form has been beamed aboard so that its true nature might be uncovered.
Magnify. Picard, this is Riker. We see it too, Number One. Get that seal back up. No matter what I do, the energy goes somewhere else.
Data! Evacuate the air from the lab. I want a vacuum there. Environmental systems failed to respond to command. It appears the micro brain has interfaced with our computers.
- Yes, but there is a pattern. Here is where it killed Lt Yar. Here is where it absorbed Cmdr Riker. And here, here, where the energy is lowest? Both times it had enveloped the shuttle. It has something to do with Counselor Troi.
- Yes, I can see that. The Federation will want to help in any way it can. Thank you. This time it will be different, I promise. It always is, my love.
Well my coach is over there. The one in the red beret trained with Dawn Fraser. The other one swam with Esther Williams in Stockholm. I thought Esther Williams, was a singer? Do you know those two men?
No don't do that. Drive on Madgett, We don't want to get into a lot of arguments with all this water over our heads. Then this woman tipped a bowl of sugar and a bottle of lemonade over his typewriter. He went for a swim in the sea and because he had eaten too much he got stomach cramps and drowned. She gave him the kiss of life but it didn't work.
What do you think I'd look like bald? Did Bellamy and you do that? *** swimming *** When I need to impress I expect support. Pardon.
I'll remind him that I'm his uncle and his superior. You were. All right. I'll go there alone. But how will you get into the Ministry?
Not yet. At last you're here! Still feel like herding the cows? Are you kidding? How are you doing?
Rassati... how often we argued! We came from different political horizons and without renouncing our ideals, we worked for the good of the country. We worked together on PRONASUR, the National South Project, a long-term transformation plan. Some day it will come true. But without us, of course.
Sara, I'm all right. It's okay, and I love you. Tell Mama not to worry. All right? I love you. 'Bye. What the hell is going on? What's happening here?
Ditching the tank and walking back. He's a fucking liar, sir. As a man who thinks for himself, what do you think? Well, sir the roadwheel's cracked, he drank our brakes the battery's low, we're losing oil. If the engine heats up, it'll seize. We have no rations.
You would have done the same thing. Samad was waiting for a chance to give this tank to the enemy. I was too smart for him. And I didn't study philosophy. I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual.
Kaminski had an interesting idea. Ditching the tank and walking back. He's a fucking liar, sir. As a man who thinks for himself, what do you think? Well, sir the roadwheel's cracked, he drank our brakes the battery's low, we're losing oil.
The closer you get to that line, the farther it moves. If you walk towards it, it moves away. It flees from you. I must also explain this to you. You see the line.
I suppose I just wanted the fantasy to last a little longer. I'll tell her tomorrow. What's your news? What? Oh--
But it's important to know it's only a fantasy. But it's not a fantasy. Maybe it would help if you talked to somebody about this, David. Mom, I don't need to see a shrink. They're not dead. They really did go to another planet.
Just blow this if they attack. All right, children. Gather round. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.
They're down to nine now, counting' the skydiver you met. These guys are mostly European, judging by their clothing labels and... cigarettes. They're well-financed and very slick. - How do you know that? - I've seen enough phony l.D.'s in my time... to recognize that the ones they got must've cost a fortune.
In Northern lreland, the seven members ofthe New Provo Front. In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberté de Québec. - In Sri Lanka, the nine members ofthe Asian Dawn movement. - What the fuck? I read about them in Time magazine.
And just what world are you from, Enzo? Okay. And now, my friends, you are invited for a drink around the swimming pool. Today at lunch you asked me if I had any questions. Ah! You finally want to know about women.
Today at lunch you asked me if I had any questions. Ah! You finally want to know about women. Are they what's most important? No. It depends.
Jacques, I think I might be pregnant. Did you hear me? God. Tomorrow is going to be a big day. When I analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent... that at the depths these men are diving... it is a physiological impossibility... that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it to the surface.
Erik Jan Hanussen! Write your questions on the cards. And make sure to seal them in the envelopes. I will guess who has asked the question. Yes. A young lady. Members of my family left for America last week.
Let me come to you. You are right. This world is not ours any longer. It's full of wickedness. Sordidness. Betrayal, fear. Pompousness.
We've known that for years. Haven't we, darling? Well, this time, he has surpassed himself. The ghosts are furious. Why?
Skelping takes a lot out of you. Look, Mary, I... I'll be in the chamber midnight tomorrow. So what's wrong with the Americans? What's wrong with these Americans?
Look, Mary, I... I'll be in the chamber midnight tomorrow. So what's wrong with the Americans? What's wrong with these Americans? One night they're desperate to leave... the next night you can't get rid of them.
I'll be in the chamber midnight tomorrow. So what's wrong with the Americans? What's wrong with these Americans? One night they're desperate to leave... the next night you can't get rid of them. One day they hate the whiting... the next day, they have to have all five courses.
Brother Tony. Brother Tony, are you all right? Brother Tony, what are you doing in the pool? The Lord works in mysterious ways. True love can move mountains.
Brother Tony, are you all right? Brother Tony, what are you doing in the pool? The Lord works in mysterious ways. True love can move mountains. Yeah, but it can't bring the dead back to life.
Cathy! Funny friend. You, you're a friend of person Billy White. But, I am your protector is not it, Liz? Think about this question:
Funny friend. You, you're a friend of person Billy White. But, I am your protector is not it, Liz? Think about this question: Why the evidence are they so confused?
You, you're a friend of person Billy White. But, I am your protector is not it, Liz? Think about this question: Why the evidence are they so confused? Clear or white hair, medium or large, flap cap or visor they do not know who they describe.
She was gutted. It belongs to you? There were bruises on the lower jaw On the left, approximately 2.5 cm under the jaw, left an incision ending 7.5 cm from the bone to the right. Like this.
- What is your name? - George. I will look for a car, George. Are you familiar with the situation? A vigilance committee was created Whitechapel, it seems.
Marcin wrote... he went to the cinema with an Arab girl. I wonder what they saw. Tomek. Are you seeing somebody? No. I'm not sure whether you have been told this.
That's right. He never came back. I liked him. So did I, but he left... for Austria, then Australia. Australia? Yes. I've been removing your letters.
Haven't you ever cried? Once, long ago. When you were left? People cry... for various reasons. When someone dies, when they're left alone...
We've been working on this Jimmy Serrano thing for six years. Mardukas is my shot. I'm gonna bring him in to federal court. I don't want any third-rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it as a Chicago cop... bringing him to L.A. on some bullshit local charge. Do I make myself understood? Can I ask you something?
Mardukas is my shot. I'm gonna bring him in to federal court. I don't want any third-rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it as a Chicago cop... bringing him to L.A. on some bullshit local charge. Do I make myself understood? Can I ask you something? These sunglasses, they're really nice.
No! What are you talking about? Let's discuss this. Find anything? - Not yet. They could've jumped off the train anywhere along the line. Trains have regularly scheduled stops.
Thank you for the flowers. Sure. Do you know what kind they are? They're called trumpet pitchers. Oh, that's right.
We don't want to tell you again! You flap them bootlips off to any of them federal men, we'll put you in the ground, boy. And that's without a pine box! You understand me? How are Negroes treated in Mississippi? They're treated about fair.
Are you a spokesman for the White Knights of the KKK? I told you. I'm a businessman. I'm also a Mississippian and an American. I'm sick and tired of the way Mississippians are having our views distorted by you media people. So let's get this straight.
No court in Mississippi would convict me for it. How about you, deputy? How are you with wringing necks? Keep pushing me, Hoover boy. You get this straight, you fucker!
We'll be here till it's finished. How about you, Deputy? Is that gun just for show? Or do you get to shoot people once in a while? Thanks for the beer.
We'll lower it below three centimetres. But below? It's raining out here. I'm getting wet! This jacket is a Ralph Lauren!
Has Officer Nordberg told you anything? No, there's been another attempt on his life. He's in a coma. That's terrible! This world is such a violent place.
Machine guns, carbines and dynamite. You'll learn how to use them. Stolen. Duplicates. You need to borrow a car for a robbery?
'This is control one. 'North king five five advises she is receiving fire.' 'There are two crews here. We won't be able to move for a long time. 'Did you hear the radio transmission from the police radio? 'They said to bring all the ammunition that they could pry loose.
'Talk to no one. Not a word. 'They say I'm thinking of my past life but that's not true.' Ready for point-slack manoeuvres? We gotta be ready if the pigs come, surround the house.
Talk about Napoleon complex, really. But, I mean, take you, for example. You say you're against violence but... - Hey, it's never simple. I mean, look at Teko and Yolanda.
The press is a tool, we'll use it. You sound like your grandfather. I wanna confront people's prejudices about me. I'm a woman and I had se... I was forced to have sex with my captor so they think I'm a whore.
- Come on! I'll get him! You see these little oak leaves? They're silver. That means I'm a lieutenant colonel.
Uh, excuse me, Book. Let me ask you just one question, my brother. What? Book. When are you going to get this goddamn raggedy car fixed, man? Now, what's wrong with it, man?
I understand you`re quite an expert on death sentence appeals. So they say. What do you know about this case? So far, not much. The kid murdered his parents?
And that one of these halls is the Hall of Souls. lt`s called The Guf. "The Guf"? They say whenever a baby is born this is where its soul comes from. As the soul descends from heaven only the sparrows can see it.
lt`s a bit small. I don`t need much room. l`d like it. -lf that`s all right. -That`s great!
Why rush it? I'm gonna make her beg. I want a date with one of those Jersey girls. I love Jersey girls. They wear black pointy bras and white lipstick.
Hello! I shot this! Those girls loved me. - In your dreams, Alan. - Oh, thank you, Katie.
Hi, Hank. Can I talk to you? Yeah, come on in. Hank was upstairs getting Grace. I was about to give Katie's ashes back to her parents the last place she wanted to go.
- What'd you say your name was? - You're dead, fucker. You come on down to these parts, you start telling people their business and insulting their race, you end up like Champlain, I'll tell you that right now. I listened to his show the night that he was killed. There was this drug-crazed kid bothering him.
- You're dead, fucker. You come on down to these parts, you start telling people their business and insulting their race, you end up like Champlain, I'll tell you that right now. I listened to his show the night that he was killed. There was this drug-crazed kid bothering him. When people smoke that crack stuff, they go berserk, you know?
You come on down to these parts, you start telling people their business and insulting their race, you end up like Champlain, I'll tell you that right now. I listened to his show the night that he was killed. There was this drug-crazed kid bothering him. When people smoke that crack stuff, they go berserk, you know? I hope they catch that kid.
You should sit down with him, have a chat. Is he gonna give you orders now? I figured you'd look at it that way, so I set up a meeting for Sunday brunch. - What? - He's got some great ideas, Bar.
My first thought was that I couldn't believe anyone could hate him that much. Disagree or dislike, but not hate him. Not kill him. My second thought was... that he always wondered if there was a God. Barry said he had to wait until the evidence was in. Now you know, Barry.
Prof. Freud is here tonight with his mother. Sigmund, don't pick your nose! THE RENTAL Marconi is broadcasting live... from the Science Academy here in Paris. A woman's place is in the home, Maman.
-It's okay. Your mom said you had a big date. Think I'd probably miss my own birthday for a date. -Don't say that. -I was looking around the other day and I dug up... these old photographs.
-Yeah, yeah. I think what I heard bak there was a bunny rabbit. All I got here is two kids making out in a station wagon. Should I pry them apart? -No, no, no. Forget it, I've got all the answers here.
I told you not to date a Jewish boy. Papa, tell me about the Special Section. Those killers. Close to the SS. I don't know. I've got nothing to do with them.
Those killers. Close to the SS. I don't know. I've got nothing to do with them. Papa they have a Photostat of a Special Section ID card with your signature, with your picture on it. It's not possible.
- Yeah. - No further questions, Your Honour. - Mr. Burke? - Nothing further, Your Honour. We will adjourn until tomorrow morning. First witness, and her bottom line is, "Are you Jewish?"
There was smoke everywhere. The air-raid sirens were on. Lt was at Kalvin's Square where I saw them. Who did you see? I saw three men in black uniforms.
- What was Operation Harlequin? Lt was programmed to annihilate the character of those living in the West enemies of socialist state, by means of falsified documents. Here we go. And how was that put into effect? Group of scientists were put into special department in Moscow to scientifically devise ways to forge documents in such manner that no amount of analysis would reveal its falsity.
Bring me a Scotch and a bottle of whatever Mrs. Talbot's drinking. I had a professor in law school who'd say: " Don't ever let a case beat you down. Always trust what you feel inside." But he wasn't a litigator. He was dropping pearls of wisdom on young, idealistic students.
Right. How does it work? Well, it's a little bit complicated. I have all the time in the world Are you really wanna know?
I've got nothing to feel sorry about Mr hot-shot auto mechanic! philosopher! And I know exactly what I'm doing, so just drop dead You can't have faith in people Only the deals you make with them
I have a library card now. What are you reading ? History History is gonna come to an end. Why are you so sure the human race is going to kill itself?
What? Forget it. I know she hates me. Aren't you coming? Women don't want me.
L'm a nobody. Am I a nobody? L'd like to grow, but I can't. Come here. Now you - go on!
Cut the skin. Oh, Lord. They're killing our horses. This will have to do for now, Pea. What Indians is it we're fighting anyhow?
Oh, Lord. They're killing our horses. This will have to do for now, Pea. What Indians is it we're fighting anyhow? Well, they didn't introduce themselves.
Where are all the others? Jake's buried up in Kansas. Deets in Montana. Gus is in a little stand of pecan trees alongside a creek where he used to picnic with a woman. The rest of the boys are up in the north country, building a ranch.
You catch that bandit? He slipped by me. Got his friends, though. Is she all right, Gus? She needs her privacy a while yet. She went through quite an ordeal.
I know that, Woodrow. I just remember how he was around supper. What's all that there? Things for Lorie. I'd like to see what you got in the way of combs, brushes, and hand mirrors.
"Being stupid" and "playing stupid" are different things, sirs. It's fifty ryo. It's fifty ryo for one gun, so for thirty guns... Fifteen hundred ryo! How much did you sell them for? I didn't.
Those are what the shogunate used during the uprising of Amakusa. They are antiques. Then the value of these guns will increase, even if they're not used. It sure will rise. All the way to the sky!
Yes, sir, except that in this box, I have a dead slug as a brilliant false moustache. Yes, only "quite" brilliant, I fear. How, for instance, are you to attach it to your face? Well, I was hoping to persuade the slug to cling on, sir. Baldrick, the slug is dead.
About the same. She's convinced that whoever has the coin has her targeted. This might make her feel better. Briggs, the cop that died, had a partner named Goreman, who was the only witness. The papers said he didn't see a thing.
What's the matter with her? What is this coin you're talking about? Some time ago... we tracked down an antique coin. The coin of Zaecles. It was owned by the leader of a Satanic cult.
What is this coin you're talking about? Some time ago... we tracked down an antique coin. The coin of Zaecles. It was owned by the leader of a Satanic cult. What did it do?
Some time ago... we tracked down an antique coin. The coin of Zaecles. It was owned by the leader of a Satanic cult. What did it do? First it killed people.
She's getting better. Warren, what's happening? What are you up to? I'm one step away from a cure. In the mid lobe of the brain's left hemisphere, there is a very small functional zone. Now it...
It's what makes us different from them. Don't you see? If I can transplant that section into Amanda, she'll be cured. It's a very small amount of tissue. There shouldn't be any problem.
If he kills them all by midnight, the cult members will come back to life! Can this Ahriman be killed? Maybe, but not with anything we've got. Maybe something in the vault can stop it. Maybe the vault itself.
Used one more time than I would have wanted. But then, what we want isn't always what's best, is it? Hmm. Hey, guys, what happened here... there was no other way, right? Well, if Faron hadn't been so blinded by love for his daughter, perhaps there would have been less blood spilled. The truth really hurts sometimes, doesn't it? You know, there's an old saying:
This is strange. What? It's dated today. These scrolls were written a while back... Why pretend they're signed today?
I-I just wanted a word with Mr. Emmett. What do you want? I guess I shouldn't have expected a welcome. I came to warn you, Mr. Emmett. The men in town are...
Not like this. Give me that ring. I don't know what you're talking about. Give it back before anyone else gets hurt. Your father died because of that thing.
She doesn't even feel like my mother anymore. (speaking French) Isn't this dangerous? I mean, allowing her to...? The mental patients are Sister Adele's special calling. She won't have it any other way. Have you contacted your superiors about what happened?
Yes, and they are considering the matter. We no longer live in an age of miracles, Monsieur Marshak. The autopsies said all three Sisters died of natural causes. These days, bishops and cardinals believe in medical reports more than works of the devil. Surely, Sister Adele is a special case.
Good. Then there's no reason for you to hold her. Come on, Micki, get your things. We're out of here. Well, are you also a friend of, uh, Ryan Dallion?
And don't think you can just help yourself. You so much as breathe on those jars, I'll know it. We've got one old guy terrified of bees, another one desperate for honey. I don't get the connection, Jack. This man wasn't just old, he was, uh, I don't know, prematurely old.
Yeah. Well, so much for him. And so much for dear old Mom. If the law can't find her, we never will. Well, if you wanted to try, you might pay a visit to the bondsman who put up her bail. Might find out something. Yeah, that's a good idea. Mothers.
Yeah. That's a good one. Ah. An advanced question. This requires planning. As I explained, in the section on how to use your TV Guide, when you fold down the pages of what you want to see, scan for those nasty sporting events that can kill your evening. That day, you set the channel for what you want, and then remove the batteries from the remote control.

You say it like it's a joke. Well, maybe that's because it is a joke. You see, the problem with this therapy stuff is that you people assume that when I get to know myself better, that my life is just going to be perfect. And that is not the case. I'm gonna get to know myself better, but then I still have to live this life.
I thought I could talk her out of it. Yeah, I would've done the same thing. I was stupid. As I was laying there all I could think about was the tape. What it sounded like.
Miss Hayes, it's not really their fault. No, Agnes. This is a personal matter between us. Radical look, chief. Wanna fill me in?
Aw, must you desert us, Hastings? Ah.., one or two things to catch up on, you know. Very well. Monsieur and Madame Tolliver and I will see you back on board ship late afternoon. Please!
- It's a doll. - Yes, a doll. Except this doll is an important witness to the truth of who killed Madame Clapperton.
I asked me himself : " Why to hide the body behind the suitcases "? To gain time? Yes, but for a special motive. This morning, the murderer entered in this floor to come for a thing.
" Why to hide the body behind the suitcases "? To gain time? Yes, but for a special motive. This morning, the murderer entered in this floor to come for a thing. But it did not manage to find it.
To gain time? Yes, but for a special motive. This morning, the murderer entered in this floor to come for a thing. But it did not manage to find it. Therefore it would return here, but only after the mail to be handed.
And when you noticed that I was hiding behind the salted cod and winked, ah, I knew it was kismet. If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'. My condolences on the loss of your eldest son, paisan. But, Gino, this is my idea. Well, you know how women, they talk in the beauty parlors.
Why stop now? What do you mean? Frankie, I know you lie to me. All men lie to me. They always have.
Oh, you think that's funny? No, sir. I don't think it's funny. Well, I do! So did I. I thought it was hysterical. I think what Rachel is trying to say... is that the idea that music... can make people misbehave is wrong.
So did I. I thought it was hysterical. I think what Rachel is trying to say... is that the idea that music... can make people misbehave is wrong. And even if it were true, which it isn't, isn't this just simply a matter of... of people not... listening to a particular radio station that might be playing music... that they might not want heard played? You don't have kids, do you, Mr. Howell? You can't watch 'em 24 hours a day.
And even if it were true, which it isn't, isn't this just simply a matter of... of people not... listening to a particular radio station that might be playing music... that they might not want heard played? You don't have kids, do you, Mr. Howell? You can't watch 'em 24 hours a day. Soon as you turn your back, they do exactly what they want. And then some.
- As a matter of fact, look! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Come on. Frank, stop it! I'd like to read you something we found in our news files... dated August 16, 1945, the day after thejapanese surrendered, and World War II ended. "The guns are silent now, "and so are many of the men whose hands once held them.
Oh, damn. The lights went out. No kidding. You got any kind of a backup? A-A generator or something? Uh, there's a civil defense generator in the basement, but I don't know how to work it.
Um, I don't have time. What do you mean you don't have time? Well, my contract was inherited- I know. By the nuns.
Anybody? We have stimulated random activity but the patterns are erratic. Hang on, Will. Hang on. The wave patterns are still too irregular.
Put your foot where it didn't belong? The Doctor was bored so I gave her a challenge. That you did. Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with elements of both. There's the point of entry.
That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. There's no evidence of nerve damage but the organisms are impeding nervous function. - My leg's still asleep. - Prognosis? The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the brain.
Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42976. 1. During a survey on Surata IV, Cmdr Riker has become infected by an unidentified microbe. - Number One. - Captain.
In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits endemic to gender. They'll knock each other's brains out because they're men? Human males are unique. Fathers regard their sons as children, even into adulthood. Sons chafe against their fathers' perceived expectations.
I just wonder what kind of party the Klingons have. - Have you got a minute? - Sure. I wanted to apologise. Your personal life is none of my business.
- Have you got a minute? - Sure. I wanted to apologise. Your personal life is none of my business. - Even if it involves your father?
I'm already set for life. And all because of that poor little kitty. Poor dead little kitty. Too bad he had to die. Wait a minute.
And all because of that poor little kitty. Poor dead little kitty. Too bad he had to die. Wait a minute. That cat, it died.
-Instead of being useful, he's playing around! He can choose his cell anyway! -Move along! -No respect for us workers... -White blood cell police...
I can't believe it! -Here we are! These genes have become chromosomes. Then become the nucleus of the cell. Mitochondria, undoubtedly a form of ancient bacteria, are surrounded by the cell which is forming.
It'll be worth it." It was. Excuse me, here, Dad, but a toilet is a toilet. Bud, the toilets today aren't worthy of the name. They come in designer colors, and they're too low.
Sound good? Oh, no, I can't do that. I hocked those the other day for a tank of gas, but, you know, I think I have a spleen left. No, but thank you. We have so many knickknacks already, it would just be one more thing to dust.
I was rubbing my eyes. This mechanic came over to me, and he said, "Don't do that. What do you think he meant? Well, you know how foreigners are, honey.

I mean, how many chickens have flippers? Well, don't blame me for that. I just thought it was an extra head. You liked it, didn't you, Bud? Well, it was tasty, but hard to eat.
Do you remember what we were doing the 24th of August of 1947? So, let's do the same thing again! You have killed the Belgians, Mayor! Shut up! Come on!
And if there's still any American, he must go too. No, not you. You're in Oklahoma fulfilling your duty. So you can stay if you want, or you can leave. What do you want?
So, is it that beautiful the dawn here? Wonderful. One here, due to necessities of duty, I have seen so many geographies that the world map feels small. There's no dawn like in these valleys seen from the capitol. Son, I think we should go with them.
Well, now that I am already here... I once fell in love, Mr. Alonso. And it worked out very well. A very nice experience. Anyway, you know how exaggerated is love.
Our red blood, if it would stop, after a few hours it would turn black. Because if you are playing or studying or going to sleep, the heart won't stop beating! It causes admiration, it causes admiration how the heart works! (bis) With its two ventricles and its two auricles the blood rides like the baddie in the films.
Ugly face should be said to be ugly. What if a person who found Buddha in a poor farmer or an ignorant peasant's face picked up a chisel, carved away and resulted in these... You must not desecrate the holiness of our religion. You will not find salvation with such insult to Buddha. The reason we lead this ascetic life is to be pure like Buddha, and don't we become Buddha ourselves when our mind is pure?
The old Park Hyun-woo doesn't exist anymore. But I still like the mine. It feels as though I am expiating myself. If we save a little more, we can buy a Buddhist dictionary. It's strange.
But I still like the mine. It feels as though I am expiating myself. If we save a little more, we can buy a Buddhist dictionary. It's strange. When people see you, they just can't give enough in charity.
But I was rejected again for the same reason. Afterwards, I committed all kinds of crimes from theft, robbery, and rape to organized crimes. One day, I looked at myself and felt a sudden urge to kill it. I wanted to return my body back to where I was born. So, I came to that temple, and I was rescued by you.
How's Sister Eun-sun? She's suffering from that cough. Are you still living with the man? He died in a mine. It collapsed on him. Oh, my...
How the hell did he change his clothes so fast? All right, it's an oldie where I come from. All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay? Doc. Doc, come in! Marty, come in.
Jennifer. Jennifer. Oh, Doc, am I glad to see you. Go out the front door. I'll meet you there.
A traitor took it from my men and murdered them. Look at him. He knows nothing of loyalty and respect. My men respect me, Sugai. I want my own territory. Your methods are crude and disgraceful.
I'm not even shocked that you murdered your wife. Lieutenant Columbo, my wife died in an accidental drowning while I was painting a picture at Vito's bar. Like this one, sir? You seem to be making some unfathomable point. We can get back to it later.
It's all the same. Good, Vanessa. Perfect, Vanessa. Everything is in its place. I want your house to please you, Max.
- Okay. Okay. Forget I said anything. Now let me just get something straight here. Am I understanding you right? I mean... Are you suggesting getting rid of her? You won't be involved. But I'll need some cash.
That's good. My mother said that I should go to the doctor. Uh-huh. 'Cause I was, you know, my eyes weren't so good. - Well, you're an ophthalmologist. - Yeah. Do you agree the eyes are the windows of the soul?
- No. - Is that who you really are? I will not be destroyed by this neurotic woman. But the law, Judah. Without the law, it's all darkness. You sound like my father.
Put it away! What's matter? Don't talk too loud! Not a room check Only women are allowed to yell
- Well, Reverend Fowler thinks so. - Who is he? He's the reverend at St. Michael's in Whitechapel. He's opened the church as a refuge to the women. Prostitutes in the church?
He's opened the church as a refuge to the women. Prostitutes in the church? That's all very admirable, my dear, but they might want to be right back on the streets the moment this ripper's caught. Exactly. Let them choose for themselves.
- What's the difference what he... - Stop it. Stop fighting. What... - It all gets mixed up. Will you two stop quarreling? If you two can't live together peacefully... how can there ever be peace on the Earth?
- Mm. There was no one. Not one man. Not three men. Not even half a man. - You're lying.
I could help you a great deal, but you close up like a clam. Uh, maybe. Maybe I am no longer a part of this world. Clichés. Empty words.
Uh, maybe. Maybe I am no longer a part of this world. Clichés. Empty words. I know hundreds of concentration camp survivors... some of them practically on the way to the oven, but they're doing fine.
Your Honour. Ladies and gentlemen of the ... audience. It's not fair to call my clients frauds. The blackout was a problem. I was stuck in an elevator for two hours. But I don't blame them.
- You're much better than you know. I wish I had this kind of support 24 hours a day. - I'd be in shape by the year 2000. - Give me a jingle in the year 2000. Why don't I give you a jingle right now?
I wish I had this kind of support 24 hours a day. - I'd be in shape by the year 2000. - Give me a jingle in the year 2000. Why don't I give you a jingle right now? So the Seven Little Dwarfs had a limited partnership in mining, and they bartered housekeeping services for room and board.
If you like, you may get a full report on his progress daily from the staff nurse. She gets off duty at 7:00. Now, if you'd excuse me, I have work to do. Goddamn! Thanks, Doc. There's a theory, John, that surgical rehabilitation can be a deterrent to criminal recidivism.
This I haven't seen in years. This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous snarfblatt. Now, the snarfblatt dates back to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day. Got very boring.
- But if you would just listen... - Not another word! And I am never, never to hear of you going to the surface again! Is that clear? Teenagers.
- Not another word! And I am never, never to hear of you going to the surface again! Is that clear? Teenagers. They think they know everything.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language! ♪ The men up there don't like a lot of blabber ♪ They think a girl who gossips is a bore ♪ Yes, on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word ♪ And, after all, dear ♪ What is idle prattle for?
♪ Bet they don't reprimand their daughters ♪ Bright young women sick of swimmin' ♪ Ready to stand ♪ And ready to know what the people know ♪ Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
"The softened flesh gives. "The path opens. "The ram penetrates." A ram? There is a ram?
But you're not careful enough. Look at your bag. Sir, be careful. One minute. I'll buy a rose.
Tolerate me. Tolerate me, please, I beg of you. It's been such a long time since anyone even tried. Oh, once, once, the women sighed. Swelled out their chests...
Tolerate me, please, I beg of you. It's been such a long time since anyone even tried. Oh, once, once, the women sighed. Swelled out their chests... How beautiful they were!
I've spent my life taking care of an empty grave. I wish I could see him again. I wish I could embrace my daughter. It would be wonderful to have a second chance. It's unbearable to think life prints in its final form what is only an awkward rough draft.
Now we have no hostage. You must help us! Are you Ataulfo? You will take a message to my people. Why didn't we leave?
But no bells rang for me. Are you not a little old to be a soldier of fortune? The gringo is not a soldier of fortune. He's an observer. - Observer? - You know how the gringos are.
Anyway who cares how a writer nobody reads ends his days? I do! I could have left with him. Even the men were prepared to go. Their mission was accomplished and Villa needed all his people at the front.
You visit your dead ones? No. Sometimes they come to visit me. I had two sons. One killed himself, the other got himself killed.

Your work for my work. That way you stay with your principles and me with mine. So you like the clothes of los Miranda. Everyone likes what is beautiful. Man is one of the most pathetic creatures on earth. Condemned to a desire that contradicts the laws of nature to close the gap between two human beings.
"I'd like to embrace my daughter again." And I said there is an empty grave at Arlington waiting for him. Waiting for my father. Your father was fighting here in Mexico? I want his body.
Amazing but let the devil take his pick. Autographed and all... "To my friend De Deus." The problem is that this is no Ethiopia. What the Red Cross and all the social services didn't solve, the gypsies did away with for good.
I'm in quite a hurry, Dona Violeta, I'm sorry but... I hope you get well, Mr. João. Beware of the bedbugs! Here, Pom-Pom. He's lost his appetite.
You won, Mr. Armando, because you're a better player. It's chance that decides who wins and who loses. When shall we play again? I haven't forgotten about your cigarettes, you know? They call me Mimi.
Might not help you. Now, I think it best we speak to Lord Maeda of Kaga At my age, I'm still so thoughtless as to cause you trouble. I apologize for that. Neither Oribe nor I can help you. I really wish that Lord Hidenaga were alive.
I'm trying to rationalize with those lyrics... trying to think, "Wouldn't it be nice? " And it just wasn't working. Some disturbing news today from the Genesee County Health Department. It announced the rat population in Flint... has now surpassed the human population by 50,000. Health officials say it's due to massive numbers of people leaving... and the city cutting back to twice-monthly garbage collection... due to budget constraints. Just when things were looking bleak, Ronald Reagan arrived in Flint... and took a dozen unemployed workers out for a pizza. He told them he had a great idea.
Do you think we need another sit-down strike? That won't do any good. That's the problem. Is this a great time for a parade? Give your life to Jesus today. Jesus Christ loves you. Give your life to Jesus.
That's why I'm not actually supposed to be doing this. I was brought up to learn to survive. If you were out in the wilderness... I'm getting ready to gut him. You think it's hard to survive in Flint these days? Why?
I saw the gun sticking out of the purse. I freaked, okay? It was a reflex. Feel my heart. Feel it. Feel it? I'll tell you some stories about scared sometime. You don't know.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, okay? I admit, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it. Women, they're so subtle.

She's not gonna call me. -This is unbelievable. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now. Why don't you just see if it's dry. No, no, no. Don't interrupt the cycle.
I don't have a daughter. He doesn't have a daughter? To open up Southern California's biggest rock'n'roll memory bank... just dial the combination on your radio. 97.5 KHEY-FM. Hello, Dr. Fishbinder. I've got three daughters, 15, 17 and 19.
What? If I didn't help her, someone else would. -You can't stop life from happening. -Well, I can sure slow it down a bit. -Oh, yeah, how? -How? Total control. Total control.
Where were you? What have you been doing, and I want the truth. I was at the beach with Timothy. I guess I forgot the time. -I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here? - I'm not entirely sure. Oh, excuse me. The cops tell their experts, "Don't sweat it. We got three people who saw this guy fire the gun."
- Fifteen is insulting. Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer. Don't bullshit me, okay, Mr Reynard? You got witness problems, you got proof problems. You're my only problem.
It sticks! Okay, oh yah, what else I got for you? yeah, check this out. This is my ant farm. You know, ants are amazing.
Okay, oh yah, what else I got for you? yeah, check this out. This is my ant farm. You know, ants are amazing. They can carry fifty times their own weight, and they work for weeks and weeks building these intricate little tunnels, and...oh yeah, they hate it when you do this...
People are.. I can't believe the incompetence in this place! People like that should be put to sleep. Well, what do you know? The research file!
Look, we just have to relax and things will go back to normal. Some animals won't mate in captivity. Like pandas. They don't. What happens?
It showed up in a carnival sideshow just outside of Arkham. Dr. Hill? Remarkably well preserved, considering the massacre was eight months ago. All the specimens from that night exhibit the same qualities. Yes, as you see, the skull is fractured right there.
Maybe it's in him. Hey, don't blow out of his ears. You make sure you tell those motherfuckers I escaped. Dear Earlene, this maybe the last letter you ever get from me. They've taken away all the paper.
- According to what we have before us. I'm sure you realize... that sedation is routinely used to control the more violent patients. - Perhaps if you had given us more notice... - We understand that, Doctor. We are empowered by the Governor to question anyone wishing to testify.
This is the rally point. Okay, boys. We're on our way. Listen. I'm showing 30 below zero here. Let's be careful.
-We better sign off. -Thanks. I won't bother you again. Smile. I'm going to take your picture.
Do you want to go out? Not really. Do you want to go out? I'm fine. Tell me about the nuns in the convent.
Killer Joe is also available as a party stimulator. Do you like pancakes? A real, live father actually living in the same house as his wife and kids. They're perfect. This is like TV.
- Exactly what principle is that? Well... - The principle that one shouldn't be out at night eating hors d'oeuvres... when one could be home worrying about the less fortunate. Pretty much, yes. Has it ever occurred to you that you are the less fortunate?
- Yeah. Ah, well, I wouldn't put much stock in them. You go to a party, you meet a group of people, you like them, you think... "These people are going to be my friends for the rest of my life." Then you never see them again.
- I want to be a real woman. - You're the only girl who's ever made me feel this way. I had nothing to do with that, and, anyway, she was completely unstable. I want to be a real woman. I called Audrey's parents exactly at 7:00.
He's about to get fired as it is. He was always saying what a lousy job it was. - Did you tell him how serious the situation is? - Yes. He's always complaining about what a lousy job it is.
At some point most of us lose that... after which it can only be regained by a conscious act of faith. You've experienced that? Uh, no, I haven't. I-I hope to someday. Actually, it wasn't my cab.
No. .. just partridges. Yours a vagabond life. In dusty faraway places. I often live in tents, yes, but to observe the native customs and ways of behaviour. Is that the English policy?
But it gave me self-confidence. And I won their respect. - Whose respect? - The members of the family. They did everything I told them.
- Yes. I put forward a project to them. If I'd had the money, I would have shot it. They seemed to want to get involved in a film project. I never thought it would turn out the way it did. He repents of his faults.
But no one knows what his intentions really are. I'm a journalist and I'm going there to cover his arrest. - You're a journalist? - For Sorush Magazine. I thought you were a policeman!
Why do you want it brought forward? For our shooting schedule. We also need a permit... to film in the courtroom. There's nothing about this case that's worth filming. - Did you study the file? - Yes.
You didn't intend to give it back? I did, but... I didn't know how I could go about doing it. On top of that... he was so keen on acting in a film that I would've loved to have the means to make one. We began to have doubts the following Thursday. He insisted we all go see the film The Cyclist.
- What's happening? - I don't know. Nobody knows. Radio in the truck... All I heard was trash talk. Same as always.
Some good old boy comes chasing them. Mean son of a bitch had some kind of hot shit gun, like an M-16. Starts... shooting around. Bullets tearing up the place. I saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming.

In order to be a teacher to show girls how to do it, I have to know how to do it. I've taught for various shows, like for F.I.T. I've taught models. Girls that are from various agencies that come to me by word of mouth. New York Xity women are a little bit harder than most women. Basically, I'm trying to bring their femininiry back and bring some grace and poise.
I'm so petite and tiny. The blonde hair and the light skin and the green eyes and the little features. And the client's hands would be bigger than my hands, while they would hold my hand or something. You know, they'd like feeling that they're with something perfect and little and not someone that's bigger than them. Because I guess that kind of disturbs them.

Most all the drag queens that are involved in the balls, they... 90 percent of them are hustlers.
- You still look great. Thanks a lot. - Thanks. We look at 75,000 pictures. Well, you know, that's the average amount that we look at each contest. What have girls become?
Thanks a lot. - Thanks. We look at 75,000 pictures. Well, you know, that's the average amount that we look at each contest. What have girls become? Are they the same?
And they don"t have to really struggle with finances and nice things, nice clothes... And they don't have to have that as a problem. I don't feel that there's anything mannish about me, except maybe what I might have between me, down there. Which is my little personal thing, so... I guess that's why I want my sex change - to make myself complete.
Score Tennille. Nine, ten, ten. (applause) There's people who sit home all day. They have potential, OK?
One of these young ladies could become the Supermodel of the World. Exciting? Try again. How does this rype of thing square with women's lib? What about men?
Exciting? Try again. How does this rype of thing square with women's lib? What about men? Do they take you seriously?
Then you think, you've left a mark on the world... if you just get through it... and a few people remember your name. Then you've left a mark. You don't have to bend the whole world. I think it's better to just enjoy it. Pay your dues... and enjoy it.
You have friends in New York, hon. Are you trying to meet people here at all? I know this sounds stupid... but have you ever just walked up to a girl here and said hi? Look, the girls here, they're different. I can't talk to them.
Great. He's got the phone off the hook now. Rejected again. That's OK, I'm used to it. Terminal loneliness.
People always think they know who a person is... but they're always wrong. Eats lunch on stairs. Parents have no idea. Mine had me tested because I sit... alone in my room all day, naked, wearing only a cock ring. It really bugs me.
Then he says... "Why don't we take our pants off and get a tan?" So I did it. But he stalled. Go ahead.
"Why don't we take our pants off and get a tan?" So I did it. But he stalled. Go ahead. And then two of his friends showed up... and they were drinking beer and laughing.
But he stalled. Go ahead. And then two of his friends showed up... and they were drinking beer and laughing. And they took my clothes and threw them up in the trees. I didn't know what to do.
Go ahead. And then two of his friends showed up... and they were drinking beer and laughing. And they took my clothes and threw them up in the trees. I didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but... they just laughed at me, so I stopped.
The usual. What is this, Tuesday? Yes, it must be. You're crying in your Scotch again. How come my generation of Jews drink?
We rumbled. - l mean we rumbled with anybody. - You were bad then. - You ever do anything, make anybody? - No. Nickel-and-dime stuff. You protect a fruit stand, man, a shoeshine parlor, you know?
"Whatever will be, will be" is he crazy? He's got to know something's up. That we must be at least investigating him. No, he's not crazy. Brennan's the only link to him and all the others. Brennan's dead. This whole thing won't just disappear, though.
We are very close. But there is a problem. What is that? Well, things are not what they used to be. For instance, 200 million pesos is not what it used to be.
For instance, 200 million pesos is not what it used to be. And these people in the union are smarter than what they used to be. And there's more of them. And these people do not respect the name of Tiburon Mendez. For them, it's only a matter of money.
Now I'm divorced. What happened? You don't have to answer. I guess I was married to jets as much as I was to her. It wasn't a good way to be living.
-Can't you humor him? I need a favor. -We'll humor him tonight. What's the difference? I mean, can't they win? Not like this. I mean, fuck him.
Experts. You have betrayed me. Nobody's betrayed you. I told you. Your manuscript went astray, that's all. Our authorities "admire" your book.
And her father was the smartest and most handsome man she'd ever met. The girl and her sister were forbidden to eat sugar... and their father refused to buy a television set... but once a week they were transported into a world of pleasure. On Friday night at 7.:30... they went across the hall to the home of an elderly man. He took them first to the kitchen... where they were allowed to make their own ice cream sundaes. He always gave them several flavors of ice cream and toppings... and assorted fruits and nuts and sprinkles to choose from.
It came with a lock and a small key, which she hid carefully under the bed. On the first page she scrawled a large note that declared.: "If anybody reads this diary, they are very mean. It is personal.!" For the most part, the girl filled it with stories... about doing punishment assignments... fighting with the boys, and playing with her friends.
He was older now and seemed happily married. She looked out the window and saw that he had gone to lie down in the shade. At that moment, she didn't know whether to feel pity or envy... for the young girl who sat alone in the sunshine... trying to invent a more interesting story. Every time the woman went back to that orange lake in the country... she would try to swim all the way across. Her father had done it many times... but whenever she got halfway over... she'd start thinking about those water moccasins.
I could have a lot of sick people around here. I could have a lot of lawsuits around here. Hey, you know, you're a good man. You show up on time for work and everything, but everybody sues nowadays, you know? All right, swab the toilets. Make sure you do the seats, too, and around the base.
No. In fact, I got a raise. Climb in. I'm... I'm really glad to see you. I'm happy to see you. Is this your car?


There's no food! We feed on ourselves. The weak ones go first. It's about my turn now. Even here, we have grades. One-horn demons like myself always get eaten by those who have two or three horns.
Firewood mostly. We don't feel right, chopping down trees, but enough fall down by themselves. We cut them up and use them as firewood. And if you make charcoal from the wood just a few trees can give you as much heat as a whole forest. Yes, and cow dung make good fuel, too. We try to live the way man used to. That's the natural way of life.
Yet, they destroy the nature on which our lives depend. They always think they can make something better. Especially scientists. They may be smart but most don't understand the heart of nature. They only invent things that in the end make people unhappy. Yet they're so proud of their inventions. What's worse, most people are, too. They view them as if they were miracles. They worship them.

- No! Not me, man. - Well, I got a problem with that. What the hell is this mountain coming to? Half-naked girls walking around at 9:30 in the morning?
Come on, let's go! Bend your knees, bend your knees! I'm sure the last skier to beat Reid, Dave Marshak, head instructor for Section 8, is preparing to do just that, although he's curiously missing from Reid's pre-pageant ski exhibition. Slalom, downhill and freestyle. Skiing is what it's all about and this week promises to be a memorable one.


Well, it's an aboriginal piece. Uh, it was known as the, uh, "Leash of Dreams." I'm not exactly sure why it was called that. It was... some connection between man and animal. Anyway, I'm a collector, and the lady who owned the house had agreed to sell it to me.
No. She was simply a messenger who didn't survive the journey. Who was she? My teacher and I have a special relationship. I send him women.
Okay. Let's just assume that she's a victim of whoever's taken these other women. All right. The police have been looking for him for months, and they got nothing. They've got an equal number of unidentified bodies.
Newts, Jeeves. Those lizardy things that charge about in ponds. Yes, sir. The aquatic members of the family salamandridae, - that constitute the genus molga.
Then there was that clown Harold, messing about at Hastings when he should have been at Westminster cutting taxes. You and I paid for the king to be taught. Oh, yes! We shouldn't have had those damned Saxons walking in as if they owned the place, for a start! They'll have us begging in the streets.
Only active measures promptly applied can prevent this poor poop Fink-Nottle from babbling about newts again. Which is why I intend to secure a bottle of gin and lace his luncheon orange juice with it. Sir? I can't imagine why you "sir" Jeeves? The plan I've put forward seems to me to be icily logical.
It's over. Thank you. You're promised to me, woman. And we got us a contract! If the girls are willin'.
Doggone it, MacGyver. The Bozers got my last one. Paid in advance, too. Yeah, well, those boys are becomin' right civilized. It's fascinating' what a gold strike will do to a man.
The Bozers got my last one. Paid in advance, too. Yeah, well, those boys are becomin' right civilized. It's fascinating' what a gold strike will do to a man. They got money, but they don't smell no sweeter.
Oh, leave me alone. Good morning, everybody. Any chicks call for me this morning? Yeah, the, uh, Malaysian mail-order bride company called. No takers.
"It's an hour drama with comic overtones "about a rapper who goes to the center of the Earth and raps with the mole people." Oh, and look. Sally Struthers is the queen. Oh, Mom. I am talking about vacation, litter of my loins. Now, I shall tell you where we will holiday.
The yoke on the oxen feels no guilt. But what we can expect is that on our one lousy, stinkin' day off, traffic can move us to our lousy, stinkin', pathetic destinations. To our polluted beaches, our burning forests, our wheezing grandmas, to our family barbecues with Uncle Otto and his runny eye. But does the highway department prepare for us? Are they out here helping us?
Maurice? - We're sick of resting! - And we're tired of fluids! We want answers, and we want 'em now! Why don't you go down to the lower 48 and bring us back a vaccine?
But I'm glad people seem to be feeling better. - You oughta be awful proud of him. - I am. Your friends are wonderful. Friends?
OK, I will. I will. I believe the first question is how come there is no known cure for the flu? Now, stripping away all the jargon and the platitudes, the real answer is... beats the hell outta me. So, working with that premise, the next question becomes isn't there something that we in the medical community - i. e., me - can do for you, the afflicted, for the next 36 to 48 hours,
We're gonna tear the tails off of the Bulldogs. And if you don't think so, then best friend or no, I'm gonna kick your butt from here to East L.A! We can't tear their tails off. Why not? Bulldogs don't have tails.
Oh, no. He's sunk even lower. I have something to say to all the sons out there. To all the boys, to all the men, to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy.
Mr. Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that could be a direct threat to the security of the Federation. Yes, sir. As Chief Security Officer, I want you at the next proceeding. Captain, they will be incensed. My presence will be disruptive.
Someone had to be blamed. Those who captured the Romulan ship had learned of the treachery, but only the Council knew whose security code had been transmitted. Ja'rod, father of Duras. This Ha'Dlbah should have been fed to the dogs! His family is powerful.
The Talarian warship, the Q'Maire, is answering the distress call. - Position? - In the Woden Sector. It'll take them hours to get here. Counsellor?
There's no time! Sir, we are being hailed by the Borg. On screen. I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile.
A warrior race. You too will be assimilated. The Klingon Empire will never yield. Why do you resist? We only wish to raise quality of life for all species.
A possibility. Yes. Captain's Log, Stardate 43463.7. We are holding a position at the Neutral Zone border proximate to Nelvana lll. If our guest is telling the truth, there are 21 hours left before the Romulan base becomes functional.
So a person fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle with his own personality, resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct and intuition as on fact. Now you're getting it. But what does one do if he has no instinct or intuition? Data, look at this. The facts just took a left turn.
You're the android. I know a host of Romulan cyberneticists that would love to be this close to you. I do not find that concept particularly appealing. Nor should you. I am told by various crew members that this viewport is their favorite on the ship. Hmm.
It's your first day out of sickbay and I don't want you overexerted. This looks like an ideal place to rest. My thoughts exactly. - Truly remarkable. - What is?
Is something wrong? No. Those glasses. They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.
- I need 24 hours. - For what? To finish this. Cooper. In observation I don't know where this is headed. But the only one of us with coordinates for this destination and its hardware is you.
You've appeared before me many times. I know you to be a fine, decent man and a capable attorney. And to see you under these circumstances is... Is dreadful for us all. Now, the law provides a structure to guide us through perilous and trying times.
The truth. I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is Thomas Eckhardt. He helped me. He took me off the streets when I was sixteen.
- I'm sorry? Is there someplace you're going to or running from? You got the wrong guy. I'm alright. Men are always alright.
Thank you kindly. The milk will get cool on you. - Pretty soon. I've heard about you. I heard about you. I will tell you three things.
Oh, I see. Well, that explains it. Oh, the way that kid drives. One of these days, I'm gonna give him a ticket. Lieutenant...
He doesn't lose any time, does he? What's happening, Peter? I'm trapped. As soon as they get the authorization, they'll be coming to stick their nose in all of our work. After which, the experiments will continue under Lloyd's supervision. Isn't there any way to stop them?
Quick, he is tending to his zucchinis. Anything new? Everything is quiet. We are going for a stroll. Many people come here.
We have to get them repaired. Let's sit here and talk a little. The tap let the bad thoughts out. It is like a souvenir from another life. Even the iron curtains do not fall as suddenly as before.
The tap let the bad thoughts out. It is like a souvenir from another life. Even the iron curtains do not fall as suddenly as before. I was very quiet, and they lowered themselves. I made you mad.
It is like a souvenir from another life. Even the iron curtains do not fall as suddenly as before. I was very quiet, and they lowered themselves. I made you mad. I said: Are they opening?
I remember how on that night,during that storm, I wanted to go and see. Is that you? It is dark! Fuses have blown! I have a letter.
There is nothing under the bed. Get out of there! It is so nice here: there are many things. Fire! Where are the sparks?
Thanks. You interested? It's festival seating, so... - How much? - 300. - 300? You charged the chicks one.
- Hey, my man Slam. - Yo. What's happenin'? Cool coat. Why don't you take it across the street to the 7-Eleven? I'm poppin' a fuckin' brain vessel.
She smelled like fish. Oh, my God! Someone shot my engineer. Hey, let go of the mike. What are you... Someone call the cops.
Two words. - Disco Express. Are you dealin' in beads or what? I mean, that group blew dog, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey, Anus. They had that...
Now, I figure you've had a pretty tough time, but you're sharp, nervy, know a good angle when you see it, and you have what it takes to finish it out. Yeah, sure. I used to be a detective, you know. Fay tell you that? I was. Put a lot of guys next to some pretty good deals. Some of them had experience, some of them didn't.
You know what that means to have someone who really need you for the first time in your life? I know. But, Collie, it still isn't right. Oh, it must be because when I woke up this morning, I was glad. I was glad to be alive, doc, because I knew someone else would be glad... And people just aren't glad unless you need them.
What's happened to him anyway, Rog? What kind of shoving around are those losers parents of his giving him? Shoving around? I guess I don't know what you mean. Never mind.
Shoving around? I guess I don't know what you mean. Never mind. I know how they treat him. He's been sick for years, and he's getting sicker.
I want you and Fay to be comfortable. You may have to hole up here for quite a while. There's plenty. What I mean is, you never know when you gonna need something, and um... Well, don't worry about it.
Don't make me do this, Kid. Please don't make me do this. If one of those guys should call Bert, he could be there in five minutes. We sat there for another half-hour or so, and he was talking every minute of it.
He's being identified as Kevin "Kid" Collins, an ex-boxer who recently moved to the area. He was last seen traveling with a woman who police believe may herself have been abducted by the kidnappers. Headed what may prove to be a related development, the body of longtime resident Dr.Jake Goldman, was found this morning bound and gagged in an isolated desert home. The 50-year-old bachelor apparently died from a single blow to the heart. The valley planning commission is meeting... When a man stops caring what happens, all the strain is lifted from him.
It was the only way my having lived could make any sense. It was why I had been made like I was-- To do something for her that she could not do for herself, and then to protect her, so that she could go on... So that she would have the reason for living, that I'd never had. Funny how sometimes things that aren't true, are more true than the truth... Because in a way Fay had been abducted. None of this would've happened, if I hadn't come along. As she said, this scheme had been cooking a long time.
Well, Collie, my blushing boy, what did I miss? Plenty. Really? Let's get out of here. Go away, Collie.
He believes he came across one of the offending spiders a couple of hours ago. Might you have brought it with you? Actually, he's probably still on the bottom of my shoe. You really can't tell what it is any more. In this first generation, the original male also produced a queen.
Did you find me another specimen? Yes, I did. I also paid a call to the town mortician. Several months ago, there was a corpse. The body was desiccated, it was totally drained of blood.
Read the newspaper. What does it say? It is all bad. People have forgotten what life is all about. What it is to be alive.
With the family's consent, signed. Leonard has Parkinson's disease? No... His symptoms are like Parkinson's disease - but then again, they are not. What will the medicine do for him?
Leonard has Parkinson's disease? No... His symptoms are like Parkinson's disease - but then again, they are not. What will the medicine do for him? I do not know what it will do for him, if anything at all.
What will the medicine do for him? I do not know what it will do for him, if anything at all. What do you think it will do? I am not sure, it was designed for a totally different disorder. What do you hope it will do?
You sly fox. Don't let the newspapers keep you down. The press are bloody fruit flies. They hover over the feces. Just swipe them away.
I know who the District Attorney is, Mr. Kramer. The only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in this case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale. I'm not following you. Because it's an election year. Ninety-nine percent of those you shovel through this court are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't speak English.
The Italians are going to love this. The Irish, too. And the WASPs. They love this shit more than anybody. They love laughing at me. All the rich sons of bitches.
I made sure I was there that day. That day would be full of revelations. I would meet Sherman McCoy at last. When he finally appeared... Well, excuse me, what the hell...? Who were these people?
Would that be a silver Peugeot convertible, sir? Who said that? I did. And who might you be? I'm the police. That oxidized relic is yours?
- To cut off your arms and your legs. - Oh, really? And I'll keep you in a room in my house. And use you just for sex. Whenever I feel like it.

We don't get it. Listen. Let me tell you something. My father was a very big man. All his life he wore a black moustache.
Now this is a parish where we understand hunger. And God knows there are many hungers inside us. There's a hunger for food, there's hunger of the flesh. A natural and understandable hunger. There's a hunger for love, home, children, these things are good.
The common law. There's another law... much stronger than the common law. What's that? The law...of the land! When I... when I was a boy, younger than Tadgh there,
It has become the headquarters for their operation. It would support an attack force... even fighter aircraft. We've accelerated our plan. These were taken a few days ago. All the major players in the cartel have disappeared.
I do not expect you to throw away this opportunity. I expect you to improve every minute of my time... by becoming the best air-to-air pilots in the world. You will fight as teams of Gunners and pilots... each more dependent on the other than to their own mama. Our mission has the highest national priority. I can't stress that enough. We're going against an enemy... who's defending his own territory.
I think so. Good. Ah, Buchanan, you're awake. Bring him here. I've been studying this pamphlet that explains your carriage.
Come over here. What shall I do? You'll be very useful. These tools are crafty devils. They hide when you're looking for them.
- With your net? - Yes. You'll be here until Christmas, my boy! These city folk. I'll show you how. Come here.
Thus, my classmate, whom we called Mangiapan shared an audacious hypothesis with us one day. He claimed that babies come out of their mother's navel. A navel cord. The other day, my sister Miette, the big one, she's in a funny state. She's courting. My brother Paul had grown. He had an unwavering interest in comic books.
almost anything will. Come with me. Let me show you a positive test for diamonds. Take this. Do you see... how the water splashes over them?
Come with me. Let me show you a positive test for diamonds. Take this. Do you see... how the water splashes over them? How it slides off in a sheet?

These poisons flowed into the rivers, crept into people. Place your right arm in the sleeve. The result, sterility. Remove your arm. Today, only one out of a hundred women... can still bear children, and some women stopped.
I go tomorrow. Oh, fuck! I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. The damn wives don't want me. I don't know why. Maybe I scare them.
I gotta do something. I'm gonna fake like I'm sick. Really bright. Then what? Then there'll be two guys in the ambulance. They must be starved for it.
- I know. I guess he was busy. You have one more month... then you'll be up for reassessment. Men didn't love you then. They didn't value what we could do.
I guess he was busy. You have one more month... then you'll be up for reassessment. Men didn't love you then. They didn't value what we could do. They... they wouldn't look at you twice... unless you were some kind of beauty queen.
Give me your hand. This way. - Why didn't you tell me? - It was too dangerous. Kate, these men are going to take you to a safe place.
And once more, we play our dangerous game, a game of chess, against our old adversary... the American Navy. For 40 years, your fathers before you and your older brothers played this game and played it well. But today, the game is different. We have the advantage. It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin, when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.
When he reached the New World, Cortez burned his ships. As a result, his men were well motivated. You have signed our death warrants. Padorin will send the entire fleet.
Two days. Do you think they will let me live in Montana? I would think they'll let you live wherever you want. Good. Then I will live in Montana, and I will marry a round American woman and raise rabbits, and she will cook them for me, and I will have a pickup truck... or a... possibly even a recreational vehicle and drive from state to state.
Sir, the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard some singing, I heard something in the background real faint. After all those subs took off, I caught it again and got it on tape. I washed it through the computer and was able to isolate this sound. When I asked the computer to identify it, what I got was magma displacement. You see, sir, the SAPS software was originally written to look for seismic events.
-He just pulled up. -Is it Adcox? -How do you know? I didn't. I didn't until you came looking for chemicals,
Thought old Marty was acting a little strange. He's right. There's residue. Holcomb is the third victim. The backdraft was set up somewhere in there. Fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door.
Fire originated in this room. Took its time. Hung out. The air ran out. It couldn't breathe.
That's wonderful. You know who one of the count's best friends is? Mussolini. No... That clown knows Mussolini?
Tell me, was $30,000 towards your campaign fund not enough? - The walls are thin here. - You've got no witnesses. The taxi driver who dropped Harry Greenberg off at your house. You got a name?
I did not find water. Estebanico will seek. In this direction. Hurry. Álvar!
Hurry. Álvar! I understand these cases, they come Boat Captain. They are full of junk and merchandise. Some stuff we would be very useful.
Your Indian love you, you won esteem. Mille ... five hundred ... half ... six ... Eight years! Eight years ... Your request ...
You are bad. You've always been bad. That's why your mother didn't notice. That's why men don't want you. Who wants a cold, unresponsive whore?
You've always been bad. That's why your mother didn't notice. That's why men don't want you. Who wants a cold, unresponsive whore? All they want to do slam the door and leave.
The other mistresses are waiting. I'm not going. Ask them to bring it here. That's not right. We should go or they'll talk.
Yes, Fourth Mistress. What are you up to? Have you seen my white pants? I washed them. Washed them?
I loved being a doctor. I used to not charge half my patients. Then the fucking State comes along, they send some bitch undercover, and I'm fucked. It ain't fair, is it? Why don't you call Opperman-Crowe?
I'm a hypnotist. Here's the water, there's the door. Sorry about the stairs. Tastes a bit like bourbon. It's simply a matter of regressing the young lady back to a happier time and then asking her who she is.
I'll bring you three pounds of it. Best you've ever tasted. You'll love it. What about you, my friend? Do you like shrimp?
All these different trams going everywhere. These are yours. Your boarding card, various ID. The things you'll need. You won't remember any of this, so you won't kick yourself forever.
I was ten years old. Television is everything to a ten-year-old. It's like heroin. You can't just pull it away. I never wanted to watch.
I'll look up some new ones in my thesaurus. I never know when you're playing games or being serious. It's both. Serious games. Why do we have to name everything? Say you had a pet parakeet.
It's kinda hard to put into words. I mean, we live this job. You can't become a cop by strappin' on a gun and ridin' around all day. When a cop walks up to give someone a speeding ticket he knows he might have to kill someone, or be killed himself. People think this job is like in the movies, where you get 17 takes to get it right.
That clear? Now, get going. I guess these air cavalry guys did some pretty crazy stuff. I heard from some of the technical advisors stories about the air cavalry that were real, that would serve my fulfilling fiction, that they really did, you know, like, for instance, a guy would go into his helicopter in North Vietnam and try to hook a bicycle and steal it with the runner. And they would shoot at him.

By this time, I felt that there was something very profound and moving about this experience, so I ran back to the house to get Francis, and I said, "You know, you've got to see this, "because they're going to kill a caribou." He was writing and didn't really wanna come, but I really encouraged him to come back to the location. And we got back there just maybe 10 minutes before they killed this caribou in this ritual way.
They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound. Are my methods unsound? I don't see any method at all, sir. Thirty-eight takes and Francis said the scene was never the way he wanted it. The people who were playing the severed heads sat in their boxes buried in the ground from 8:00 in the morning till 6:00 at night.

And that's what poor filmmakers, in a way, that's their greatest horror, is to be pretentious. So here you are, on one hand, trying to aspire to really do something, on the other hand, you're not allowed to be pretentious. And finally you say, "Fuck it! I don't care if I'm pretentious or not pretentious, "or if I've done it or I haven't done it."
In one of his letters, he complained... that his fellow soldiers were disturbed... by the killing they'd seen. He wrote... "Guys over here expect their hair to stay dry in the rain. " Your mom called. Yeah? What's happening?
My brother Christopher warned me I was gonna regret it. But by the time I realized he was right it was too late. Definitely, one of the all-time worst. It wasn't just the physical aspect. There were so many technical things.
Good evening. I don't know about you, but I'm freezing my ass off. But we're gonna do a good show for you anyway. For some strange reason... I failed to realize the first leg of the tour was during Japan's rainy season. So, for three straight weeks we performed the show in a blizzard.
- You lied. - What did I lie about? There was only industry people in the first two rows. - I didn't like that. - You said there wasn't gonna be any.
Let me read this first, then you can comment. 'Madonna Dumps Beatty For a Black Dancer.' It talks about Slam. 'Madonna Swaps Beatty For Dancer 31 Years Younger.' First of all, that guy's name is Oliver.
That's all she remembers. She said she wasn't drinking. She had cranberry juice. That's all she had. They drugged her ass.
The one about the beans? I'm replenishing my fluids. A fart is a chemical substance. It comes from a place called Bum. It penetrates through the trousers... and lands with a musical hum.
I'm soaked and I lost my way. I wouldn't want to disturb you. - I've brought the bread. - It wasn't worth the time. Take off your shoes. Bring me the straw.
It nearly drove me mad. I often dreamt he would die. All this is useless... he died. I don't know where or when, but he's dead.
You promised you'd tell me the story with the kite. - Now? - Yes, now. More straw. When the earth starts to burn, because it is scorched by the sun, humans will have to leave. Then, what history will call "The Great Migration" will happen.
Big and small will cling on to the cord, and all the humanity will fly away, in search of another planet. Each one will carry a small plant, a rose tree, a handfull of wheat, or a new-born animal. Others, all volumes of poetry, written by men... It will be one very, very long voyage... And how will that voyage finish?
I'm glad you have the money. If we're looking for a fat man, why don't we get one under the bridge? Oh.! Oh.! The sheriff and his posse are here.
Dude, if we can't steal from them going into the bar... dude, we can get them comin'out.! - See, Bob, dude? - Not me. So long as I don't know these guys personally, it's okay with me. See, uh —They're from Beaverton, new to the business.
Fadela's within 30 feet of us. See if you can find her. There. She's right there. That thing she's cutting up... have you ever seen that before? Looks like some kind of sea creature, I think.
I think our metabolisms are very different. Whose? Yours and Kafka's? I thought you were finished with doing weird stuff. I thought I was, too, but I guess I'm not. Personally... I prefer a pyrethrum job to a fluoride.
I think the woman would have sex with you, Mr. Lee. The man, he only likes Interzone boys. I don't want to fuck 'em. I just want to talk to 'em. You know how Americans are, Kiki.
Wherefore did they not that hour destroy us? My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, so dear the love my people bore me; nor set a mark so bloody on the business; but with colours fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark; bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd, nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats instinctively have quit it.
'Tis best we stand upon our guard, or that we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons. Lead off this ground; and let's make further search for my poor son. His spirits hear me, and yet I needs must curse. All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on prosper fall, and make him By inch-meal a disease! His devils hear me, and yet I needs must curse.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, but that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel, Who had no doubt some noble creature in her, dash'd all to pieces! Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground - long heath, brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done, but I would fain die dry death.
Hag-seed, hence! Fetch us in fuel. And be quick, thou 'rt best, To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly what I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar, that beasts shall tremble at thy din. No, pray thee.
Well, she's gorgeous. Mm-hmm. Oh, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Wanna help me do some work, baby? Hmm? A little drool there on the lip.
They.. they ordered two passports. Who? Was it Blake? Huh? Was it Earl Talbott Blake? I don't know who it was.
We're with the district attorney's assistance club. We're assisting the district attorney, so don't make me club your ass. Blake, I should thank you for this, you know? Going crazy, it's strangely libating, isn't it? You better climb, you son of a bitch!
Did I invite you over here to talk to me? When young, we mourn for one woman. As we grow old, for women in general. The tragedy of life... is that man is never free... yet strives for what can never be. The thing most feared in secret... always happens.
"He rents a room in a large house and rarely sees the people he lives with. "One is called Frank something, and he thinks there are some more... but he can't be sure." I guess that means all of us. "He comes from a light blue-collar family. "He doesn't see his parents much anymore.
But I've been thinking about it, and I think it's kind of cool. Actually, I kind of agree with it. It's like about Krishna. You know, like Smurfs are blue. And he's saying that Smurfs are, like, getting kids used to seeing blue people.
Actually, I kind of agree with it. It's like about Krishna. You know, like Smurfs are blue. And he's saying that Smurfs are, like, getting kids used to seeing blue people. And it's like, you know, with Smurfs being blue... kids see blue people, they, like, relate to Smurfs.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise. - Sir? - You have hearing problems? No, sir. Klingon blood.
Tell me what you said. I said you had a nice pair of eyes. And what did I say? Do you remember? Yeah.
We'd still have our lives ruined. - Know what else? - What? If you hadn't come out, that guy would have hurt me a lot worse. Probably nothing would have happened to him. They would've said I asked for it.
You're awful You quarrel with everyone Even Gachet. You fought with him You're rude to Aurier You know ciritics like Aurier sell art
Even Gachet. You fought with him You're rude to Aurier You know ciritics like Aurier sell art Buyers are more influenced by.. what they read than what they see You know it
Where? There. I'd never felt such pain It lasted at least 20 minutes A cold compress helped a bit
You met him outside a hardware store so he's probably not a surgeon. I'd have to explain my work to him. Forget it! Take him to bed. When men are in bed, you can ask them anything.
Just two nails. Just a minute, okay? Try this one. That's the sound I need. But I also need the tile.
Hey, whatta you want, huh? Whatta your want, huh? So what about this Emerald guy? Did you ever hear of the New York drug gang called the Executioners? Yeah
I got the bag, Tracy, come on! Where'd they go? There! They've got the bag! Can you make it? Sure, no problem
What's that? It's a little equalizer for tomorrow All these have a transmitter And I'm gonna see if I can attach this little thing to Emerald's collar lt will amplify the signal and it'll shatter his eardrum Here, try it
You have to find out what you can't know... before you know you can't, don't you? So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all. Why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable? Somebody's got to start sometime. Think how many things were unthinkable a century ago... and yet people have thought them.
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices... and make a fortune off the stock market? It seemed to me... the universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state... when it recollapsed. If this were so, time would go backwards... when the universe began to collapse. People in the contracting phase would live their lives backward. They would die before they were born... and get younger as the universe got small again.
Not all the things Stephen says probably... are to be taken as gospel truth. He's a searcher. He's looking for things. And sometimes he probably talks nonsense. Well, don't we all? But the point is... people must think. People must go on thinking.
Whether refinement of these experiments... might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure... but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness... and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way... over a very tiny, limited scale, but something maybe of the order... of a reasonable fraction of a second. And there's no reason to believe... that one's conscious experience... shouldn't be part of somebody else's... at some other stage. I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies... but it's a plausible picture... that you could be somebody else... and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past, not in the future. Even if there is only one possible unified theory... that is just a set of rules and equations... what is it that breathes fire into the equations... and makes a universe for them to describe? Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Last year, she couldn't even do a somersault. Thieves. Beggars! Who's a beggar? Our new relatives, that's who!
Do you think Ziks has been... No, they need to use him as a sheep dog. So they can't be beggars. - What about the rest? - The rest of what?
You have a lot of growing up to do. Shush. Keep quiet. Studying hard, I see? Do you know that your soul is as white as snow?
It swam all the way from the Kuril Islands. When the captain reached shore the dog was waiting. He took the dog with him to Petrograd. It was such a clever dog. This dog... in Petrograd, would buy the newspaper for its master.
When the captain reached shore the dog was waiting. He took the dog with him to Petrograd. It was such a clever dog. This dog... in Petrograd, would buy the newspaper for its master. Then it would read the paper and it would point out the political bits with its snout.
They ain't following no more. Don't you believe it. What'd I say. Now you stand over there, Kitty, there's a good girl. Right, who's first, you or you?
Not a color card there, sir, nothing but the smallest of the small. So you think. So I know, sir, so I know. Let me make the thing clear to you. You consider your hand so strong that you could afford to show it?
-Pass it around. -You know what? This reminds me of the Christmas that Mama got laid off from work... and she brought us home those dolls, remember? -Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah.
This reminds me of the Christmas that Mama got laid off from work... and she brought us home those dolls, remember? -Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah. Yeah, she couldn't afford their clothes, so she told us they were topless. I remember one Christmas I wanted a set of drums so bad.
Everything is great. Even your Aunt helen's mustache is great. Wait, hold it. "Everything is great"? Mom, you okay? Baby, listen, these days I'm seeing life in a whole new, wonderful way.
Even your Aunt helen's mustache is great. Wait, hold it. "Everything is great"? Mom, you okay? Baby, listen, these days I'm seeing life in a whole new, wonderful way. This cup is not half empty, it's half full.
well, yeah, I wanted to keep up with the Joneses, honey, not the Jetsons! Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, before y'aII split each other's wigs... -can we have our tickets, please? -Oh, sure. You lost them, didn't you? No I did not lose them, thank you very much.

The "glory That Was Rome" suite? And if you recall, the chariot bed didn't need horses to move it across the room. welcome to the Casbah. What happened to Rome? well, actually, the Roman suite next door is already taken.
Erm... yes, well, anyway, My Uncle Henry gave me the tip when I first came to London. "Never forget, my boy," he said, "if you stand outside Romano's, in the Strand, "you can see the clock on the law courts, in Fleet Street." Most people wouldn't think it was possible, because there are a couple of churches in the road.
Very good, sir. My sister is coming back from India. She's the one with the three little girls. I refuse to believe my own kith and kin can be described as hard-bitten thugs. Woosters may have faults, but thuggery has never been one of them.
Ah, Jeeves. What happened to the quiet evening with an improving book? I felt the need for a change of air, sir. Well, Jeeves, you'll no doubt be surprised to learn that something in the nature of a hitch has occurred. Did your proposal meet with a sympathetic ear, sir?
He was telling me that it has become his principal duty to read to Lord Bittlesham in the evenings. If I were you, sir, I would volunteer to take over that particular task. Ah! Old man moved by nephew's kindly action, you mean? Partly that, sir. I was relying, however, more on Mr Little's choice of literature.
All right, all right. I won't say it again. Though you say it strangely, the M'Iver name is banished, even from pronouncement on pain of death. Can I ask why? Because of the treacherous union of Iain M'Iver and my half sister, the evil Morgana. That vile partnership has claimed the lives of many innocent people and my own vision.
fire. He's done it, sire! He's done it! You have proven yourself, Maclver. Your magic is good.
I like to travel lightly, sire. The suit's heavy enough. As you wish. This amulet had I with me for many years. A symbol of good fortune. It kept me safe.
Well, we can't just yet. Kluge's gonna hijack 200 pounds of crystal meth. We can't let that stuff hit the streets. Two hundred? Now I get it. They don't just want Hinkley. They wanna rip off his meth lab.
Oh, it had to be him. He owns Stroud. Perhaps we can explain. Hamilton Plaza. Is an urban redevelopment project.
Pretty good. Tell me something, Ed. You ever notice how with men, they never really listen to you? Nope. Watch one sometimes.
Tell me something, Ed. You ever notice how with men, they never really listen to you? Nope. Watch one sometimes. Oh, they pretend to listen.
See, now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel." You see, but men just fly. Because women... You see, women nest, and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had storytellers that would tell them stories.
- You're flesh and blood. - I had nothing to do with any of this. I met all her friends. I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper.
Think they brought it in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table? What's going on? It's a little early for a Christmas party. -Why'd France give that to us anyway? -It was a gift. Countries just exchange gifts like that?
And then he kicked me with the other foot and he threw some change at me. But I didn't want the change, Georgie. I wanted the cashmere. I had a feeling you would like it. -I'm going to try it on. -No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.
It took me weeks to figure out how to work this thing. You are not an historian? More of an inventor. Until recently, a dismally unsuccessful one. What are your intentions?
We have to look inside your vessel. Curious till the end, Captain? You can't be serious. We've been through this. Some objects have gone missing.
I'm afraid you won't be awake for the ride. I assume your hand print will open this door whether you are conscious or not. That weapon was working yesterday. You were right to suspect him. But he is not from the future. He is from the past.
I'm not sure who to feel sorry for, the Captain or the kids. I want you to know, we're proud of our science-fair winners. Perhaps some of you will... choose to pursue a career in Starfleet. Well, then... What did you do for your science projects?
We've got a problem. The quantum resonance caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment field. When the filament hit, the ship was momentarily charged, as if it came in contact with a live electrical wire. That weakened the containment field around the antimatter pods. The field strength is at 40 percent and falling.
Most systems are down. We can't contact anyone off the bridge. Don't count on leaving through there. An emergency bulkhead closed. - Confinement mode. - Isolation protocol. I'm not really familiar with that protocol.
Switch to primary bypass. Nothing. Field strength's at 40 percent and falling. We've got a problem. The quantum resonance caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment field.
You are doing very well. I'm sure the child will arrive soon. Worf, has the baby turned? - Turned? - So the head is down.
I felt... completely free with him. Unguarded. At ease with myself. So many things made him special to me. Where are they?
Ambassador. I hope Dr Crusher was able to help your headache. Thank you, she was. Governor Leka has intercepted us to update us on her planet's situation. The people on our moons have been in discord since they migrated from our planet five centuries ago.
Contraband. It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand. Mint tea. It's been years since I've had any.
Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you. Thank you for coming on board, Mr Dokachin. Quite a ship you have. We're linked to your computer if you could access the files. I don't usually see them in such good condition.
I believe it must eventually come. Our two worlds need each other. Forgive me, I... I did not expect to hear a Romulan proconsul speak like a member of your underground. Well... I want you to know exactly where I stand. Do you believe you can gain the support of your full Senate?
It's been suggested that he might have defected. Who'd want a Vulcan shield array? Beats me. Every question we answer brings up two more. Be careful, Android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears.
Yes, I will. Jolan true. Perhaps this is not such a good place to talk. So what do you think of your enemy, Capt Picard? These people are no one's enemy, Senator.
Very well. Senator Pardek, your service to the Romulan people is noted and appreciated. Jolan true, Spock. Do not be distressed. Your dream of reunification is not dead.
- Yes. All right, well our forests need saving because of the way people regard them. Expendable. If the Ghostwood development cost thousands of lives, do you think it would have a chance of going forward? Well, trees aren't the same as people.
- How much time we got? - Not enough. Let's leave him here with us. Maybe something will bubble up. Harry, we're in trouble.
Irene, we have to notify the sheriff. Nicky stop that please. Nicky stop it. I can't understand this at all. I just had the car checked and gassed.
That strange? That is strange, look what I have. It looks like we all have something to talk about. It fits. See the mountains kiss high heaven, And the waves clasp one another
- landscape architects... - Huhh-yah! - choreographers... - Haww. High karate at low, low prices. I cannot tell a lie. Hey, Mom, how about... if I learn karate? Will that make you happy?
It's right over there on the pegboard. The pegboard? What's it doing on the pegboard? Shouldn't tape be in a drawer? Jill, this is a garage, not fabric World. In a shop, tape hangs on a hook because it has a hole in it.
I'll talk. - Are you really going to talk? - You told me to. But it won't help them. You're completely surrounded by my men out there.
This is the worst failure of my life. Gotta be a first. Who's this? - My grandfather. I stayed there with one of my friends. - The natives who live there worship this idol.
One night... during the crossing of the Indian Ocean... in the main room on the big deck... there had been a sudden burst... of a waltz by Chopin. There wasn't a breath of wind... and that night... the music had spread all over the black liner... like an injunction from heaven... related to something unknown... like an order from God... whose meaning was inscrutable. She had wept... because she had thought of that man from Cholon... her lover... and suddenly she wasn't sure... of not having loved him... with a love she hadn't seen... because it had lost itself in the story... like water in the sand... and that she was rediscovering it now... in this moment of music flung across the sea. Years after the war... after the marriages, the children... the divorces, the books... he had come to Paris with his wife. He had phoned her. He was intimidated.
In one act of brutality you have created chaos. All the tribes are now joining forces against us. All of that because of your criminal savagery. Savagery, is what monkeys understand. You should have done the same a long time ago, Don Cristobal.
It's not what I meant. - Then, what do you mean? - I'll be gone for several years. I have enemies at the courts, powerful enemies! The boys bear my name and now my titles.
A New World, Buyl! No one wants one, only you! Not only me! Look at these people. They could go back to Spain to see their families.
Sorry, I didn't call you. - Look, Rusty something is going on here! So, that's what I'm trying to tell you, but you don't listen. It's an evil force. The only evil force in this house is you.
George, I've written this for the end. For the last 20 years I have known happiness. I wish I could write more about this. But, it involves love. Perfect love is the most beautiful of all frustrations.
...that these socks were damp. And we found these socks in Harold's boot. But the socks on his feet were dry, and these wet socks were in his boot. And I couldn't understand, if he got up at 8:00 and he put on dry socks, when did he take the damp ones off? But he had this ticket to play poker in a tournament that night.
- That's the pattern. Kidnappers, they like to gloat a while. Not too long. The adrenaline's pumping. They want the money fast. They want to get to you while you're still in shock. You'd be surprised how many ransom kidnappings we never hear about. People pay, and if the kidnapped party's safely returned, that's the end of it.
That's what made me notice it. Most of the delivery men pull in headfirst, then they back out when they're through unloading. What kind of deliveries do they make after 11 o'clock on a Sunday? Nothing that I know of. You got some kinda interest in that van?
The nigger's the one... that wouldn't even think about telling you. You all right? Put it down. Go wait with Betty. We took eleven million in drug profits... out of the van.
Thank you. That's kind of you, Miss Strandberg. There's been a lot of sickness this year. - Has there? - Yes, it's the strike.
Arvid's been fired for what he said at Monday's meeting, the manifesto... Come on now, or there'll just be more trouble. We aren't solving anything standing around here staring. No, we must meet somewhere and go through all this properly. The question is, where can we meet?
Here's a letter from Anna to Ernst. Postmarked in Weimersville four days ago. Ernst will be back from Norway next week. There's no point in forwarding it. Anna forgot to seal the letter.
Yes? You write to him, don't you? Yes, that's true. I have written to him. But I haven't had an answer. My letter must have gone astray.
You can't possibly stop Anna, Mrs. Åkerblom. - The future will reveal that. - Exactly. I'll go to Anna now and tell her of our conversation. Perhaps you could enlighten me about your engagement.
She's always swollen. And I think she likes crying. I was given this medallion on the day I got engaged. Henrik's father gave it to me. It had cost much too much, of course, but he never bothered about money.
Luciano Pavarotti. So, do you bring your friends up here? -l haven't got many friends. -Sorry. I'm like the birds I care for.
- All right. Welcome to Kauai. You like this, Jack? Beautiful, huh? So romantic.
That's Mrs. Lupo with the cable installer. I'm Jack Singer, and I was hired by Mrs. Lupo's paranoid husband, who turned out not to be so paranoid. I feel for the guy. I really do. I feel for all these people, men and women, the cheaters and cheated on, sneaking around hotel lobbies looking over their shoulders.
Tough day, huh? It's so awful. And besides David, they have a two-year old. - That's my point. - About what?
You always heard people in the next room making noises. Now you remember it in a glorified way. - Are you ever attracted to other women? - Like who? Like all the women you have in class, who are so talented and insightful.
Now you remember it in a glorified way. - Are you ever attracted to other women? - Like who? Like all the women you have in class, who are so talented and insightful. I'm sure they worship you.
I was fascinated. I was absolutely nuts about her. And ultimately she wound up in an institution. I mean, it's not funny, it was a very sad thing. She was great, but nuts. See, I've always had this penchant for what I call "kamikaze women."
Judy told us they did finally go to dinner. She said she was tense and nervous, although the others seemed fine. Afterwards, they walked home. She tried to participate, but found the atmosphere strained. All in all, she said, it was a very peculiar evening. It's amazing, isn't it?
She was depressed. We'd try and cheer her up. I'd be scared to live alone where you live. It's really scary. There have been burglaries. My neighbor was robbed. And nearby, people were at home.
Because it's over and we both know it. Do we? All that stuff... Those memories, they're just memories. They're from years gone by.
- I was knocked out. I'm thrilled. I'm so glad you like it. You're so encouraging to me. I want you to know that. Don't be silly. I'm just one opinion. You're the opinion.
- Yes, it was good. And that music was fantastic. I usually hate Mahler, but it was good. The last movement's too long. The second movement was good. It began well.
I couldn't bring it up. I was so hurt. And so full of rage. And scared. For weeks I waited for him to say he'd met someone. He never did. Although I was suspicious, I never found another incident.
-Fine. It's lovely here. Everyone, this is Lorenzo's sister and brother, all the way from Rome. This does not make sense. Lorenzo's saturated fats have risen.
Doing just fine, here. You're going to be OK. It's Christmas Day, you know. All across the country little boys are trying out their new bikes. Hey, champ. I think you'd better tell your folks to lighten up.
However, there is evidence of early occipital-lobe involvement. Why are all these people here? I beg your pardon, Lorenzo? -Why are all these people here? He asks why all these people are here.
Polish. Straszak. I have copies right here. Polish Journal of Biological Sciences 1979, Volume I I. They loaded the diet with one fat and decreased biosynthesis of another. Yes, I remember this article.
It means to claim for oneself. And I claim the right to fight for my kid's life. And no doctor, no researcher, no bloody foundation, has the right to stop me... from asking questions which might help me save him! And you have no right to stop the sharing of information! So you think about it! -Our job is to be there for the parents. To comfort them, not to get them stirred up.
Our oil, your produce, huh? There aren't that many potatoes in the world. OK. Here you go. So, when will you tell Nikolais? Well, we told him and the other doctors and we sent all the figures.
No, whatever the doctors say, reason tells us it is a risk worth taking. But, my friend, we need a sympathetic collaborator, hm? If it was in my hands, I would do anything I could to help, Mr Odone. I have a boy of my own. But I don't like our chances.
We were inseparable by day and insatiable by night. Just lived on love and stale croissants. She chucked her job. I couldn't bear to part with her. "I'd been granted a glimpse of heaven... "then dumped on the sidewalk of rue d'Assas. "The gates of paradise had opened... "only to slam in my face. "
Everything that occurs between you... becomes a sacrament, don't you see? Come on. Sit down. Have another cup of tea. It'll steady your nerves. So, anyway... that was our sexual Rubicon. It opened up all sorts of new possibilities.
If the so-called Negro in America was truly an American citizen we wouldn't have a racial problem. If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic if the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were authentic, we wouldn't have a race problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation decision were authentic we wouldn't have a race problem. But you have to see that all of this is hypocrisy. These Negro leaders are telling the white man that everything's all right, we got it under control. That everything Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil locked us in chains one hundred million of us, broke up our families tortured us cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.... Let me tell you about black history. We are the original man. The first men on earth were black. They ruled. And there wasn't a white face anywhere.
He was bleeding like a stuck hog. So what you gonna do? He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim! But you ain't gonna do nothing but make a speech.
To have economic leadership in our own community. No, this isn't black supremacy this is black intelligence. The black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the American right wing for 400 years. Four hundred years. We thought by following those ignorant Negro preachers that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the group that was brutalizing us.

Four hundred years. We thought by following those ignorant Negro preachers that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the group that was brutalizing us. A hundred years ago, they used to put on white sheets and sic bloodhounds on us.
All I want is support for my three children that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad provide for them. That's all I want. Allah will provide for all of us. What do you mean, blackout? Perhaps some brothers are a little jealous.
Perhaps if people here in America would try and practice and study the religion of Islam, it might help to erase the plague of racism here. I think Muslims over there look at themselves as human beings, as part of the same human family. Today my friends are black red, yellow, brown and white. Are you prepared to ask the UN to bring charges against the U.S for its treatment of Negroes? The audience will have to be quiet.
- Good night, Daddy. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission but I couldn't do it. - I love you all. - What kind of mission?
Not a chance. They know every move I make. Besides, there's nothing a doctor can do. I feel normal. I probably could use a shave, but who's gonna notice?
- Oh, no. Ever since there been Cajuns, they been squeezing the passion fish. Some says you gotta swallow them raw. I don't need it that bad. What is this island, Rennie?
He's coming back, Mike. It's not Mom's fault... but he's coming back. Fire! I could be one of those girls. - No, you're prettier than them, Mom.
Two for us, please. - How many? - Two, please. Thank you. While I watched Sinbad do battle... with the massive, irate, two-headed chicken of Colossa Island... my mind started putting together all the things we discovered that summer.
- Use some orange juice. - I don't like orange juice. Boys, tell me, what happened out back? Nothing. Some kids wanted to get into the clubhouse, that's all.
- Give? - Uncle. There are seven of these lost secret fascinations and abilities. They are: That animals can talk.
"Want to know more about the Old West? "Exit one-half mile ahead to see the best. "Just mosey on in Geronimo Bill's Buffalo Farm and Wild West Adventure. " Can we go, Mom? Please!
"They were compromised "by the seed of lesser races "who were attracted to the works of the superior men." "The undeniable reason for their decline was then "due to a kind of racial blood poisoning. "Racial blood must, then, be preserved in its purity at all costs." The money will be transferred to your account in 30 days. Did you finalize your plans for the old place?
A few years ago, that was a white area. Mein Kampf. You know it? It's about war, isn't it? This book was written by Adolf Hitler and turned into a joke by the people who don't want you to know Hitler's view of the world.
- No way. She is. Fuck. What's that motorcycle doing out there? Some guy brought it in here earlier. Wants to sell it to us.
You know what I mean? That´s all. until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned-- war. Yeah, you know? So, I just prophesize, and everyone know that that is truth. And that it comes out of the mouth of Rastafari.
I didn't hear till last night myself. The word's probably got all the way to Texas by now. Nobody'll come clear from Texas. You sure they got that money? Women can lie.
Sally, see to Will's horse. What are you doing here? Just thought I'd drop in on you. We ain't bad men no more. We're farmers.
He's the Schofield Kid, nephew to Pete Sothow. I seen two fellows following me. My guess is, you come to kill me. We never talked about no other fellow. There's two cowboys.
- You met him last year. He worked in an investment group, he used to change dollars for me. Oh, yes. The other day I saw him again at a family party and he told me he bought a Kawasaki 400. Some time ago he parked it outside a movie theatre and it was stolen.
One Parisiennes and one Marlboro. Take a look at the eyes. Sorry to bother you, I know you won't believe me. They gave me fake money and I'm broke. I live far away.
What else? Begging your pardon, sir, but mightn't the answer on a globe be a curved line? Wasteland... wasteland... My word! Oh, that. That's the Hand of Fate.
Oh, let's just say I've always wanted to check out Gotham's second-best athlete firsthand. The Alaskan timber wolf hunts in pairs or in packs contrary to the way this predator is commonly depicted in wildlife adventure films. Thinking of acquiring a new pet, Master Bruce? No, Alfred. Just searching for some connection between Hamner, those stolen wolves, and that hairy weirdo.
A special steroid derivative I've been working on. Undetectable and unbeatable. One thing you should know. This serum contains both steroids and timber wolf estrogen. All designed to heighten one's physical attributes to their utmost.
You are a gem. Now remember, the serving crew should wear the new aprons I bought. -By the way, where is the serving crew? -Serving crew? By that you mean, the crew that serves?
Okay, servers... let's go out and show those partygoers the best darn time they've ever had! Say it once, say it loud, we've got brie and we're proud! We've got brie and we're proud, hilary. What is wrong with you, child? They're out there.
- Juice? No. No, thanks. Look... I got some problems, you know, I got to deal with tonight. - Woman problems. - Women.
Tomorrow we go French. But tonight we go Dutch. Game plan for tonight, will. As soon as the parental units are out of the house... we pick the girls up at the hotel. Then, we ply them with Perrier to get them in the mood.
Be today. Be. Be! The tango and the foxtrot didn't kill New York, brothers and sisters. The bootleg booze and the jazz music didn't kill it.
I'm enclosing a programme." "Tuesday night, a few of us went to the Frolics on the Roof." (Jeeves) "Bea Lilly gave us her impression of President Hoover. "Muted, since Mrs Hoover was nearby. "l thought I was in for a quiet night, but fate decreed otherwise.
A dozen? I'm not going to be in this hotel that long, surely, Jeeves? I could not say, but Miss Rockmetteller, Mr Rockmetteller and His Grace seem to be settling into your apartment. I have put Mr Rockmetteller in the small spare room, sir. How are the Duke and Rocky's aunt getting on?
A crime has not been committed, blast it! If I might be permitted to speak, officer? No, you might not. I don't like your attitude, Jeeves. I was merely wondering, officer, whether these gentlemen really intended to prefer charges.
You cut off my allowance. Rubbish! Just you wait till I get my hands on you. (Birdsburger) I'm gonna write to my senator. I needed money to start the chicken farm.
- My son employs a manservant? - Oh, yes, absolutely. I say, would you care for a cup of tea? - Jeeves, bring some tea, would you? - Very good, Mr Wooster.
If the Duke is unwilling to finance your farm, sir, you may be forced to sell his story to the newspapers. - The Chronicle would jump at it. - They would, too. - l absolutely forbid it, Francis! - Five hundred a year.
[Exclaims] Now hold on, child. Don't go having your baby in my cab. (nurse #1) Call the code! (doctor #1) Clear the hall! Come on, let's go! ( <hon>doctor<hoff> #1) Here we come.
Could these feelings of anger and vengeance influence your evaluation of Miss Kostrinski's behavior? Possibly. Thank you. You're excused, Dr. Olivet. Court is adjourned until tomorrow morning.
It won't fly unless we present a reason Scanlon wanted Duff dead. Duff was stealing from him. His combined accounts had less than $2,000. The wife. They didn't live together.
Feminism isn't a bad defense for a contract killer. Lanie's a true believer. If she knew, she'd remove herself in a minute. No judge is gonna let her quit now. Not prior to closing arguments.
- Come on! What's the point in trying to get out of this? We already know we fail. Not so. We only know that I die.
Who's to say what's worthwhile? Well, lying on your bunk reading "What Bike" and eating Sugar Puff sandwiches for eight hours every day is unlikely to qualify. So because I haven't written any symphonies or painted the Sistine Chapel, I'm prunable? No, because you're a totally worthless, unwashed space bum, you're prunable. Precisely.
- Oh, here. Excuse me. Anyway, we were watching you on TV... You get in the bubble with him? No.
- Yeah. Right. - I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. But I can't get that hand off my leg. I'm looking at the hand thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg. " But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words: "Would you mind?"

You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high. I went out with you. That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? Women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head one by one until they're bald, Jerry, bald above the eyes.
You're running around looking for something not even there when everything you dream of is right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George, give him these. These'll work. I knew those condoms were defective!
- Michael Jordan! - The Knicks! We're going to the game! Did I tell you? - I can't believe it! - You may have hit with this one. - You see?
We're going to the game! Did I tell you? - I can't believe it! - You may have hit with this one. - You see? You see, I see things as they are and I say, "No."
Did I tell you? - I can't believe it! - You may have hit with this one. - You see? You see, I see things as they are and I say, "No." Wait. You see things as they are not and you say-
You see, I see things as they are and I say, "No." Wait. You see things as they are not and you say- You see thing- Do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things? Let me call Elaine and Kramer.
I'm at The Paramount, adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of angry demonstrators gather to protest the first public appearance of Donald O'Brien leader of the Midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. Mr. O'Brien advocates the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is en route and should be arriving momentarily.
You know, we're living in a society! The flight was delayed. How long you been here? I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway. I can't believe- Get rid of that piece of junk.
The flight was delayed. How long you been here? I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway. I can't believe- Get rid of that piece of junk. One mile from the exit, it starts shaking, violently shaking like it's having a nervous breakdown.

I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me, he has my number. He should call. God, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes. I can't stand these guys.
If he wants to see me, he has my number. He should call. God, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes. I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them, and then they don't call.
There's another call. Jerry! -George? -Kramer, put Jerry on! -I'm in the middle of something. -Call back. -Kramer, no--!
Well, now that we're under way, I can tell you about our mission. Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a metagenic weapon. Oh, my God! I am not familiar with metagenics. Genetically engineered viruses designed to destroy whole ecosystems.
- Which is where exactly? - I'm sorry, I can't tell you yet. It would help to know about our mission. Mr. Worf, I have my orders. I'm sure you understand. Doctor, this deflector wasn't set properly.
I have a personnel review scheduled at 1300 hours. This would be a good opportunity to meet the other students and parents. I might be able to reschedule the review. Good. I'll let them know you're coming.
As the value of their horns increased, the number of white rhinos in the wild kept falling, until they finally became extinct about two centuries ago. Now I'll show you a pair of animals we're trying to save from extinction. Would you follow me? They're from Corvan II, where their homes in the rainforests are threatened by industrial pollutants. They're called Corvan gilvos.
I will return shortly. Report. The soliton wave has continued to increase in... Excuse me. It is increasing in power. Its energy level has risen by a factor of 96.
How do we stop it? There are two possibilities. We could use our own engines to generate an inverse-resonance wave. If we match the frequency and amplitude of the soliton, we should be able to neutralize it. You don't sound very confident.
I understand your son was here to see you. That's right. We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship. Then, that's your loss. Our families are one of our strengths.

Somehow, they were eliminated in the shuttle crew during transport. So what do we do? Well, we have a couple of options. These are the plants Keiko was carrying. Whatever turned the crew into children turned these into seedlings.
But to leave the Enterprise... In a way, you're very lucky. You might have a chance to do what most people only dream about. Have a second childhood without the pain of growing up again. This is Capt Picard's rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure from a tissue sample I took this morning.
I walked. For hours. And you're just out of bed! It's delicious. You always say that.
You know, I'm not exactly sure. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 46315.2.
What's the matter with this thing? Second Officer's log, stardate 46315.5. The behaviour of the ex ocomp has puzzled Dr Farallon and myself. We have brought the defective unit to the Enterprise for investigation. The exocomp came out of the plasma conduit.
Do you have any basis for that? Yes. When you tried to send the exocomp back in the tunnel, it deliberately burned out its control interface. Deliberately? The computer diagnostics show the exocomp disabled its interface. That could have been a malfunction.
The exocomp would normally take several minutes for such a repair. But in the tube, it will find a plasma-cascade failure in progress. I assume this is a simulation. Yes, sir. An overload signal will simulate a failure in one minute.
Son of a bitch! That dirty son of a bitch! I couldn't find her, Nick. The house is locked up. I don't think she was home. Was her car there?
- Okay. How come? - 'Cause I never took it in. It's still sitting in a shopping bag under my desk. - In your office? - I forgot it. Honey, people walk by there-- strangers.
I told you to bring ice, but you forgot it in the cab. Got it. How do you forget ice in a cab? I don't know. I'm such a jerk. The driver, he had one ofthose little coolers in the front seat.
Officer Koo, isn't it the base of Asia the Invincible? General Golida, Asia the Invincible sank the Dutch warship... right here? Is Asia the Invincible that horrible... as you have mentioned? The world of Han's martial arts is hard to predict and understand.
Don't think that it's an ordinary bet. Some one will come to take your legs. Go. I haven't known your name yet. I am the same as you, we have no names.
Asia the Invincible, the Sun Moon Sect. Those who are longing for my return, I tell you! History can be changed! Is Asia the Invincible so horrible! This disaster will begin from this ship.
A Papua New Guinea story! - It's "Papua." - I don't give a shit! Isn't that the place where the village boys go into the woods, and they build a giant lean-to... - That's right!
I just want to show you something. I want to share this with you. What do you think about my Saguro? The cactus? - Nice, huh? Let me let you in on a secret:
They say that he could have there a role for me on stage. And keep your silver for costume; I shall not need it, I am going to play my own role! Crop was thin, and are not it any more, The sterile animals...
I shall not need it, I am going to play my own role! Crop was thin, and are not it any more, The sterile animals... they increase. The spare orchards...
My father would never allow it. Your father! You are your own master ΅X wait not his permission. I get ready to accept the priesthood and thanks to his help I shall acquire a quick progress. Joseph, you are a hypocritical.
My castigation is devoid of clemency. Monsignor, your advice is blameless, ... your sense of pertinence there material of marvellous justice. We take in your place an unique freedom, knowing that we have your approbation. You cannot hang me. You cannot touch me.
It is in my strength to sell you the success of the fertility. Thanks to me, you will become as fertile as the valley of the Jourdain... that the Garden of Paradise... Paradise the Sky. A day... when I will be married... I will take your remedies... And I will have a son as splendid as yours. Look at this miracle.
Yes. Do you think I am nice? There is who say that you are him. And you, who did you say about it? Does not our success entice you?
Go home some time. And don't dress like a boy all the time. I am Yip Pak Chow of Ngo Mei Clan. Granny. Ngo Mei does not have any young pupils.
You don't think he has hurt you enough? So you think we'll be happy if we are together? Ni Chang. with your damn personality. no one will have a good ending with you! Whatever you do. don't pull the hair out. Moon was hit by the witch's poisonous white hair.
What was his cut for setting up your deal? One percent, $45 million. One percent sure has come up in the world, hasn't it? On the Safeway buyout, he and his cousin George pocketed $60. $60 million apiece.
How does that work? - Ask Don. - I run my company. Henry and his cousin George are the majority owners but they maintain a total hands-off policy. What's the catch?
Did you know people in the company call me Cupcake behind my back? I'm fixin' them. I'm workin' on a deal in Florida to get you an honorary degree. - Honest to God? - Bet your ass.
Millions of dollars to develop. All those zeros right down the crapper! You're entitled. Year in year out, that's the kind of money he makes for the company. People take winning for granted, sweetheart.
I'll just take whatever the board thinks I'm worth. Hell, all I am is a salesman, you know that. I've been door-to-door, house-to-house, company-to-company all my life. A salesman's biggest commission isn't measured in bucks. Every sale we poor bastards ring up is a validation of who we are.
If your numbers were to get out, as they stand now you'd probably get a lot of flack about it. - Especially from your board. - Why would they ever get out? Where did that Premier story come from tonight? This town worships success.
I think I can sell it. Thank you. Ross Johnson's final bid is for $112 a share. The KKR bid is $109. Thank you.
Welcome to Weird Warren's V-V-V... Video Countdown. Homeboys, homegirls, ain't no need to be lax cos you got Weird Warren workin' wax. Of course, CD stacks and video tracks. CB4 is one of the hottest hip-hop groups to hit the scene in a long time. They come not out of Compton, not out of Oaktown, but out of a small town called Locash.
- Come on, Pops. - I already got it on one. - Put it on negative one. Make us both happy and turn it off. I like this music. I like what it's about.
Cell Black 4? Excuse me, Cell Block 4 has polluted the airwaves of this nation for too long. Their record of incitement, lewdness, poor grammar will see them jailed, banned and with their feelings hurt. As you've probably gathered, this is notjust a movie about rap music. It's about much more.

Cosmo curled up at his master's feet as the Major proceeded to brief Hunt on his mission... It appeared that minute, life bearing spores drifting in clouds across a distant galaxy had been touched by unknown rays from a dying sun, and had hatched into a colossal monster - who fed off X-rays... - As mum's not getting up, we're going to have your party in her room. What? I said that as mum's not getting up, we're going to have your party in her room. So why don't you do her a favour and clean yourself up?
Julie's bloke. He's coming to lunch. We're having it in the dining-room. Did you see his car? No.
I can't stand this place anymore. I'm choking. You never ask... What? No, nothing.
He'd been robbed once before. Could've been the same thieves. - They dumped money all over. - Who found the body? The apartment manager and Miss Lauren Staten.
Do you mind if we walk and talk? No, not at all. - What is it that you want? - Well, I'm making up my report and there's one point in your story I'd like to clear up. You said that Mr Franco told you that he had to leave your party to go play poker. - Right? - Right.
If he thought you were in the apartment, why would he let himself in with his keys? Well, I would think, Lieutenant, that he rang the bell. Because I was with the manager, no one answered, and so he let himself in with his key. Oh, right. You were with the manager. Right. So he rang and rang and then... The trouble with that is that ringing would have warned the thieves and they would've run out.
Oh, right. You were with the manager. Right. So he rang and rang and then... The trouble with that is that ringing would have warned the thieves and they would've run out. Well, maybe it did, but they didn't have enough time to get all the way out. Oh, OK, I see what you're saying.
- I did. - How? Nick called her 12 times in the last ten days. It's a toll call and it was on his phone bill. For the past ten days, he had his phone bill sent to a PO box.
Slater, man, why are you always such a dork, man? - What are you talkin' about? - "Check you later." "Check you later." Hey, man. Get off my case, man. Oh, man. Chicks don't want to hear that shit.
How's this year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'? Wood, you're gonna end up in jail sometime really soon. I know that for a fact. No, man. No, let me tell you. That's what I love about these high school girls, man.
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail sometime really soon. I know that for a fact. No, man. No, let me tell you. That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age.
No, man. No, let me tell you. That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age. Yes, they do.
You are not capable of fooling me. How is your heart, Dad? The ants have been leaving me alone for a few days now. What do you mean, "the ants"? Yes.
- Come on, tell us! Before they hear it from the mouths of other people. Right around here, two centuries ago, the Italian Army of General Napoleon Bonaparte had arrived. The French soldiers had taken more or less our same route. On foot, though.
- Did you see the Frenchmen? - Yes, yes. The Frenchmen. - Let them sing, those Frenchmen. - Sing?
- Yes, yes. The Frenchmen. - Let them sing, those Frenchmen. - Sing? The fact is, they cut the noblemen's queues off.
The Frenchmen. - Let them sing, those Frenchmen. - Sing? The fact is, they cut the noblemen's queues off. And if they try to say a word, they'll probably cut off something else.
I scared you. Was it those brats again? Let's go wash your hands. Come on. You don't have to listen to them.
Hello? It's me... listen... I've found the aquarium. Yeah... just a minute... I'll look on my map...
After the hostilities ended I went to Texas. Got into a little scrape with the law. Come down here, got a new name. New start. Wife. Family. But in my heart well, hell I'm still a Tennessee man.
-How will he find us? -Easy. We're the only ones out here. Apache medicine man. Probably on a pilgrimage. The Apaches, they believe in that power.
Down here, here, here, here? Hell, I'm in real good. Ain't slowing me down none. We came across an overland. Four dead, horses gone.
'I have served you well in the past, but my judgment has been called into question. 'Without doubt, I made an error in trusting the word of Geronimo... '...that he would surrender. 'Perhaps others will be more correct or more fortunate. 'The real tragedy I know you do not understand: 'That is, to the Apache people.
Men of divided loyalties. I will keep troops in the field until the enemy is fully subjugated fully pacified. There will be no compromise with the honour of our nation. There will be no compromise with the honour of the United States Army. As he had promised, General Miles sent troops forward without the Apache scouts.
I know you miss her. All right, you got a piece. Now. - It's got blue on it. - So it has to be the sky. Right. And it's got a straight edge.
Mother in Boston, father in Arizona. How tragic. Where's Arizona? Texas. Any brothers? No. Any sisters?
- Herr Bosel, I do not 'score'. It's a question of pleasure. Perhaps it's beyond your limited horizons, but I once spent a night lying next to a woman... and nothing happened. That happens. Problems getting your trunk off, right?
Hard to say. One person becomes this, another that. Once you become something there's nothing you can do. Would it have been better if I'd been born a woman? Having a period every month isn't a bowl of cherries, either.
Once you become something there's nothing you can do. Would it have been better if I'd been born a woman? Having a period every month isn't a bowl of cherries, either. In India, for instance... because they believe in reincarnation, the question of emancipation doesn't even arise. One time you're a man, the next time a woman.
Yesterday I took Willi to the woods. Just Willi and me. It was great. Willi was so happy. He hates being home, too.
Think Paul's escape is a political manoeuvre from the opposition? Your behaviour attacks freedom of expression! I hate this room! It's strange. And the voyeur's address?
I don't know. Can't concentrate with all these photos. No more photos then. Now concentrate. I'm concentrating.
Can't concentrate with all these photos. No more photos then. Now concentrate. I'm concentrating. The lamp, it's moving.
God only knows what else. Things you would never dream about. You stay the way you are. You don't know what such feelings could do to you. Yes, I do.
I got some of these, with bigger numbers on it. Some guys were looking for Uncle Louie. They gave me a dollar. I get half, right? They look like killers to me.
There is no restaurant. He's afraid to be a businessman. He likes being an usher. He doesn't want babies. He doesn't wanna get married.
That's what life is all about, making a big splash. Otherwise you die a nobody. And I ain't dying till I'm somebody. Did Grandma ever put my father in the closet? Not a chance.
You are cruel. Shall we skip the Frisches' party? No, you mistake the whole situation. You're not going to bore me with political talk. It's most important that you don't worry about it. - No, no. - Me, worry?
Tomorrow afternoon, at 1700 hours we will detonate six atom bombs over the Forbidden City. That's the last of the bugs, sir. That should give those Reds a thing or two to worry about. Thank you. You remember the Americans, don't you?
That should give those Reds a thing or two to worry about. Thank you. You remember the Americans, don't you? Since they don't have an embassy here, they asked us to be their eyes and ears. Say Lyndon Johnson signed an order to bomb North Vietnam, Laos how would the Chinese react?
Just another dull, aging couple with our walks... We are a dull, aging our TV, our lox and bagels and our twin cemetery plots? We should be as lucky. To be in their shape at their age. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts? If I lifted them I'd get a hernia the size of the San Andreas Fault.
I saw her on a bus. It was passing... You're absolutely sure you saw her? - You saw her face? Excuse me. - I'm telling you. - What was the bus number?
Do not you love me? Why, no. No more than reason. Your uncle, the prince and Claudio have been deceived. They swore you did. - Do not you love me? - Why, no. No more than reason.
Did he never make you laugh? I pray you, what is he? Why, he is the prince's jester. A very dull fool. His only gift is in devising impossible slanders.
"Against my will, I am sent... "...to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that. But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
There's a double meaning in that. But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? So says the prince and my new-trothed lord. And did they bid you tell her of it, madam? They did entreat me to acquaint her of it.
I'll bet there are quite a few people in this shit pit of a town... who wouldn't believe you ever were a kid. I know. It's not fair. I try so hard. Not hard enough.
Aren't you supposed to be in school? Got a cold. Hello? –Is anyone here? –I'm here. The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.
You know what they say: Drinking makes depression worse. What do they recommend for anguish? Where've you been? The library.
Don't use my name. Write it down. You mind getting off at the next exit? Why? A tan car's been two cars behind us since we got on the parkway.
We ran a picture, with the article, of the president and Mattiece. It was taken unbeknownst to either one. In it, the president and Mattiece are in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge sipping on some bourbon, having a good laugh. The best of pals. "The President's Most Secret and Generous Contributor. "
For the moment, the secret of my magic and my puppets is safe. I must escape Germany before the Gestapo finds me, and the formula falls into the wrong hands. Von Kersting, the printer, will forge me a passport. So this Toulon wasn't a Nazi. The Nazis were after him.
It's cute. What do you think this is? Maybe that's the formula Toulon wrote about. Wait a minute. How can liquid animate these guys?

My sempai? That wouldn't be massa, would it? No. The sempai is the senior man who guides the junior man, the kohai. In Japan, the sempai-kohai relationship is presumed to exist when the younger man and the older man work together.
No. The sempai is the senior man who guides the junior man, the kohai. In Japan, the sempai-kohai relationship is presumed to exist when the younger man and the older man work together. Hopefully, they will presume that of us. So what does it mean that I was called twice?

Japanese cigarettes and credit cards. Nice tight roll of $100 bills. Miss Austin's well taken care of. These little guys eat shit in Tokyo. Crammed into subways, working for big companies.
In Japan, criminals expect to be caught. Convictions run about 90%. Here, it's closer to 17%. They think we're stupid. They think we're corrupt.
Let's... adjust resolution and... magnitude of each of the colour channels. Let's filter out all the noise we picked up along the way. Holy shit. Eddie Sakamura. Then he witnessed the murder.
He's afraid to get caught with me so he uses my car... and kill himself. I didn't like the colour anyway. You reported the murder. Then you called me in? My father always said, if you need help, call Connor-san.
Not at all. It's simply a... refinement of my earlier views. Foreign trade invigorates America. I've always been a proponent of fair trade...
All available personnel are repairing primary systems. The Cardassians took everything of value. We're virtually defenceless. I discussed this with Major Kira, the attaché of the Bajoran government... Understood. - What about the civilians?
I'm a strong proponent for their entry into the Federation. - ls it going to happen? - Not easily. The ruling parties are at each other's throats. Factions united against the Cardassians have resumed old conflicts.
Major. Remind me never to get into a game of Roladan Wild Draw with you. They were using a field to block our sensors, but we were able to penetrate it. What are their defences? According to our scans, an estimated 5,000 photons, integrated phaser banks.

Major, I was found in the Denorios Belt. I don't know where l came from - no idea if there are others like me. All my life, I've passed myself off as one of you, always wondering who I really am. The answers to my questions may be on the other side of that wormhole. You coming?
for christ's sake, lighten up. you'll have a stroke before me. look, i know we promised you a promotion at the end of the quarter. everything's on the back burner. you can't do that. will you listen to me?
where is it... everyone wants to go in the nineties, gang? does anybody know? back to the fifties. back to the basics. back to a simpler time. that's why our first cookie is going to be oatmeal raisin classic.
-...but you know it's not my fault. hello, Roy. A Winchester! Thanks. I found me a room.
You're so cool. And sometimes Clarence asks me what would I have done if he had died. If that bullet had been two inches more to the left. To this, I always smile. As if I'm not going to satisfy him with a response. But I always do.
Now look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker... the more I think you did the right thing. That's what I was trying to tell you before. The guy was like a mad dog. So, the cops, they don't think.... No.
Sicilians have black blood pumping through their hearts. And if you don't believe me, you can look it up. Hundreds and hundreds of years ago, you see... the Moors conquered Sicily. And the Moors are niggers. You see, way back then... Sicilians were like wops from northern Italy. They all had blond hair and blue eyes.
One. Two. Three! Both of you put the fucking guns on the floor now! Fuck you! All you pigs! Put your guns on the floor! Monty! Are you, nuts?
- Where did you get it? I grow it on my windowsill. The light is really good there. I'm up high enough off the street so, you know, you can't see it. It works perfectly.
I mean all this poppycock about engineering and him getting a job. What do you think his parents will think? I haven't the foggiest. Johnny's parents are working people. His father's a miner.
For example, people puzzle over the nature of something they call the "soul". But this may just be because they're thinking of the soul along the lines of a physical object. They're confusing one way of talking with another. The job of philosophy is to sort out these language games? Exactly.
I want to be perfect, don't you? Christ, no. - Then I don't see how we can be friends. - Neither do I. I used to believe that language gave us a picture of the world.
Known, here you is! Wong Master, you have many disciples! Disciples? I am bad example for the company. You are too modest!
We're expecting a Japanese agronomist responsible for the 110,000 acres around Tokyo. He wants to talk about my projects. He wants to understand the secret of our equilibrium. It's me! I've given up the plan for an avenue with palm trees from L.A.!
Fire! -Catastrofe! Calamity! -Oh my dear! Such things could never happen here Such things have never occurred here.
Eh, Fido? I rise above the human heap. The world is mine to take. Eh, Fido? Men are fools who walk in dreams. They sleep their lives away.
Sorcerer? I conjure demons, charm beasts, and birds of prey too. Fido! As you will see, that's not all I can do.
I conjure demons, charm beasts, and birds of prey too. Fido! As you will see, that's not all I can do. I have power over people, though they may appear complex
Banzai! Get set, GO! Now, shall we slaughter? Except for the Princess, that, we agreed. She is the price for my traitorous deed.
In Double Dutch. She's fortune-telling. My lad, what have you got there? My pretty one, your coat is bloody. The blood is flowing.
She takes the overdose of pills, lays on the bed and imagines how beautiful she'll look on tomorrow's front page. Unfortunately, the pills don't set well with the enchilada combo plate she sadly chose as her last meal. She trips in the bathroom, goes head-first into the toilet. Is there a reason you're telling me this story? Yes.
Yes... - l saw Stilton at the Drones tonight. - Oh, yes? Yes, he was in a wild mood. He looked about the Drones' smoking room.
Would an intellectual girl like Florence go to a place like that? No! Jeeves, when I came home, do you recall my saying I was going to bed with an improving book? - Certainly, sir. - Thank you, Jeeves.
But I don't think we need to worry on that score. Lord Sidcup's eloquence on behalf of Winship is having such a marked effect that I doubt that revelations by Brinkley or anyone else could do any more than dent his majority. Really, Jeeves? Are you sure? Well, that's wonderful.
You said he was innocent. If it gets us face-to-face with Bunker... This is an outrage. And a proper way of securing the testimony of an uncooperative witness. It's a prosecutorial mugging, is what it is. Lieutenant.
Praise the Lord and pass the martinis. Wait a minute. What's a party without munchies. Anybody order room service? I'll check the computer. (Logan) Six platters of cold cuts were delivered to room 1510.
Olivet prepped her six times. Six different answers. We don't put her on, the jury's gonna wonder what we're hiding. The wife and... What's her name, Stark? Yeah, the two of them tied your hands behind your back and then asked you to swim.
Arert you and the girl's mother divorced? We share joint custody. Janet left the day before yesterday for Majorca. Some spa. Of course, they don't have a phone. My agent's trying to contact the consulate right now.
Freeze it. Look at that jacket. The people in the stock room wore jackets like that. Go forward, maybe he turns around. They said as soon as she talked to an employee, the tape was shut off.
Yeah, but, Liz, you're not suggesting we indict Diane Meade? I'll testify at the grand jury. Lawyers don't criticize lawyers. You've something personal here? I mean about psychiatrists?
(Steinmetz) Judging from the bruises, I'd say he went at her from the front. (Briscoe) He must have been staring straight at her. If you're thinking prints, forget it. He wore gloves. You're gonna take somebody's purse...
I'm the scout party? Dave, you crazy fool. We're saving your bacon. Don't sling your love spuds on the barbecue. Sir, we can tackle the emohawk together.
Yeah, one squirt of liquid dilinium will freeze it exactly where it stands. OK, fellas... let's go. It's lasered its way back to the engine rooms. Probably looking for you two. Let's go.
Sirs? Gentlemen? I think we have a suspect. I got it! I got it!
Legion, may I be frank? It's not often we meet an individual who could improve our already top-notch team. But in you, we feel we have. In our travels, we've met precisely 31 individuals, and we've never felt moved to invite one to join our crew. True, most of them wanted to suck out our brains or erase us from history altogether.

Sophia, take care of these fellows. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this. - Get away with what? - "With what?"You know what.
I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this. - Get away with what? - "With what?"You know what. With the waitresses, how they're all alike.
With the waitresses, how they're all alike. Of course they're alike. They are my daughters. Your daughters. You must be very proud, Mr. Barzakian.
- Do you have a ketchup secret? Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. But I want you. God, I hate these mixtures.
Bart Simpson? The spirited little scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes... and sent me to this dank, urine-soaked hellhole? Uh, we object to the term "urine-soaked hellhole"... when you could have said "peepee-soaked heckhole. " - Cheerfully withdrawn. - What about that tattoo on your chest?
What does it look like to you? It looks like a residual charge in the graviton generator. If it is, it'll bleed off. Let's run a quick level-3 diagnostic. Bashir to Ops.
Send the symbiont back to stand trial and keep the host here. It's a bit more complicated than that. What a surprise. Please enlighten me. The symbiont and the host are biologically interdependent.
It was kind of you to try and protect me - someone you'd never even met. There's much of Curzon that's still a part of me, that still remembers what you had together. But it was Curzon Dax who swore himself to silence to preserve the memory of General Tandro, not Jadzia. I felt it was important to keep that promise. The General's memory is cherished by your people.
That makes him a war criminal, just being there? If you'd been there 12 years ago when we liberated that camp... if you'd seen the things I saw... All those Bajoran bodies, starved, brutalised... You know that Cardassian policy wasn't just murder. Murder was the end of their fun.
The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night.
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing. For god's sakes, play something! Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all. He says... " <hon>The 2 women<hoff> are standing "facing each other in dead silence.

I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when  <hon>they<hoff> had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way my folks used to live.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why a hand has five fingers?
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about Doc Bull and the widow Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right. The cops can make it plenty tough for you.
You're breaking my heart. - Shut up. I can't say much for the women though. But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21. Before that, they're... But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown? Oh yes, they're dark.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well, the horses look good.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our girls are all well-behaved.
Are you enjoying yourself this summer? Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement. Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. - Well, I'll try not to if you say so. - No.
Oh, I mean it, all right. I think you're off on the wrong tack, Regi. I wish I could show you how valueless money is. You can't. I know what love can get you into.
There are burglars singing in the cellar. Burglars singing in the cellar! Yeah, there's burglars singing in the cellar! Great big fellows, about eight feet tall... They sound like...
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot. I thought you said another foot!
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife.

Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked thing doing?
Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new alarm clock last week. It carried a five year guarantee.
I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way  <hon>my folks<hoff> used to live.
That's impossible. Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case. - What about it, Whitely? - I can explain that, Inspector. I knew Barelli had sent flowers to the theater this afternoon.
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin. Miss Franchette, do you recognize these men? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
Yes, madame, sometimes I am dizzy with the beauty of my own thoughts. Perhaps the sun has something to do with it. This sun is nothing. Wait till you get beyond the mountains... and through the gates of the Sahara. There the sun blazes.
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often lovers think that they should hide their true feelings.
And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why  <hon>a hand<hoff> has five fingers?

I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?

I thought maybe it could be from the vic's finger if he stuck it between the ligature in his neck to try to defend himself. But the edges of this pattern - they look too defined to be a digit. Hmm, so if the vic didn't cause it, maybe the murder weapon did. So I went to the party. So did 200 other  <hon>people<hoff>.

They're never gonna let you go out with me again. My dad was wondering if your dad was in prison for hitting you. Yes. As well as other things. I'm so sorry. Stuff happens.
I won't. So he killed her because she was working him for the diamonds? Yeah, looks like it. You don't think so? Crews?

You're trying to get me to talk about my mom to see if you can squeeze any more pulp for your fiction. "Pulp"? You think what I do is pulp?

So no tribal tonight. That sucks.It's like,we've got a game plan. I'm ready for action. The dragon slayer has to wait another day to taste blood. The doctor said that fi-- if it got bad-- which it would have if i would have stayed that i,you know, could potentially lose my leg or lose my life.

Hm? What do you mean? I saw your eyes the first time Fred Walters spoke to you outside that wretched hat shop. I saw the excitement there that your life might be going somewhere different, somewhere new. I am correct though, aren't I?
You shagged Effy? Oh, come on, Freds. When? First day I met her. Why didn't you tell us?
Check it out. With the two blonds. Oh, thank you. I don't believe this guy. I give up. I do not understand  <hon>women<hoff>. Never have, never will.

Just a bit. And you work for the police? Sometimes. I was told the police weren't going to investigate. You have any idea what kind of work your sisters were doing over here?
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about Doc Bull and the widow Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
Good. So now you know. - So where's he moving? - That I don't know. I bet it's that house that's next to Taco Taco Taco.
I've already considered that possibility. Walter, is that the Trichloromide? No, no, no! What are you doing? That's gonna kill you.

One man is dead in what people are describing as a bizarre "suicide by cop." The victim, Leonard Clark, pointed a weapon at several officers... who were forced to open fire... killing the man instantly. Details are still sketchy, but police are describing the weapon... as a modified .45-caliber blank gun... commonly used in the motion picture industry.
But remember this: The greatest honor a man can ever achieve is to live with great courage and to die with his countrymen in battle for his home.

I'll come home when i want to. You figure it out. I'll be home at 7:30. Claire! Do you have a car?
Mr. Vaughn, stay on point. I grew up in this town. People used to walk tall in this town. They wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino. We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

I used to get confused. I used to get confused where things begin and when they end. Or what happens before and after. What about Mom and Dad? Did they cross the river?
I don't know. What if I was different? What if I was just like everybody else, James? How would you feel about me then? You just don't get it. Things aren't different.
Why do some men need 30 orgasms a week, and others almost none? Because everyone is different. The problem is, most people want to be the same. They find it easier to simply ignore this fundamental aspect of the human condition. They are so eager to be part of the group, they`ll betray their own nature to get there.
If poor Father ever... - Where are you going? - To show Bubbles. - Come here. - What? - Are you crazy?

If you don't want it, the cops will. I think they're going to like to know you're in New York. Hot, ain't it? Hey, you ain't seen that kid around anyplace, have you? Old Man Griswald's gonna have quintuplets if he ain't found.
I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way my folks used to live.
Is this too difficult? Kevin, where's that list you had of all the other weddings - going on in the city today? - It's right here. Okay, thank you. Colin!
Authenticated by the clergy themselves... - Purchase this holy water and... - Excuse me in a minute. Keep your loved ones safe tonight... I'm tired of you comin' around here, scaring people, selling your superstition.
Military witnesses may be called provided the defense does not violate their professional secrecy. Attendant, conduct the witnesses to their room. - What about the Dreyfus case? - Referencing it will not be allowed. Mr. President, if Dreyfus was justly condemned a full inquiry now would give that condemnation increased weight and we would lose our case.
That would be some kind of overkill. Did your father ever take you hunting? Honey. You know a lot about a lot, you don't know shit about Southern daddies and their Southern daughters. I think the movers are here.
No. They were either too busy or too afraid. Out of all the teeming millions of this great city only five girls had the courage to take their very lives in their hands and accuse Johnny Vanning. In spite of all threats of reprisals, the horror of which they knew too well they were ready to appear before you to testify. And let me be the first to admit the truth of the accusations that were brought against these girls in a desperate effort to discredit them.
Betty, I want you to tell me the truth. I wanna know why you're not going back to school. All right, I'll tell you. I can't. Don't you think my friends have read the papers?
Two twin planets whirling together around one sun, but each with its own and opposite gravity. In our world, it's possible to fall up and to rise down. But, my story it's about love. Some people say that true lovers are one soul that is separated when it's born, and those two halves will always yearn to find their way back together. Well, to understand my story, you need to know the Three Laws of Double Gravity.
- You and me. - What do you mean "me"? It's a way to shut down all the synthetics. There is a kill code. It's a long complex sequence, but I got a look at it.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
They seem to be used to the sound of the saw, but the little one is having trouble navigating now. Sometimes hitting the side. Well, has anyone been down there yet? No, and no one is going to go down there. Why not?
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
Why not? Because grays can take out 10,000-pound killer whales with one swipe of their fluke if they feel threatened. It would be suicide. Well, Pat, we have a big, big problem. Stretching for miles and dropping like a wall straight to the bottom of the ocean, this massive ice blocks any path the whales might take to freedom.
Dances come and dances go, but whether slow or hot, very soon the latest dance... But if any of you were alive in 1785 You remember how people were shocked and aghast At a thing called the waltz It was too, too risque.

The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
And, interestingly, for the weather related events, our activities-- primarily greenhouse gas emissions-- are contributing to more intense and more events. It cannot be acclaimed by just better reporting, it has to be explained by changes in the atmospheric conditions. Imagine a base ball player on steroids who steps up to the plate and hits a home run. Can you attribute that home run to his taking steroids? Well steroids occur naturally in very small amounts in your system but by adding just a little bit of those steroids you can change your background physical state and increase your chances for enhanced performance and that's exactly what happens in the climate system.
We don't, actually. I got tired of his routine. Where do you keep your cuffs? Excuse me. Donna Miller.

I could stage a Beatles reunion concert in the main yard. All I need is a name. Yes, you do. And a pricey one at that. I'm all ears.
Did you hear that? It ain't good. People, a cell that is not in motion is not a productive member of the system. It ends up assuming all the other cells are gonna pick up the slack somewhere. But they don't.
I'm slapping you! I wish there was something we could do to help, but we're non-violent. What do we do? Stop! What happened to non-violence?
These are the wrong coordinates. Try again, please. Do you recognize this? How did you get that? This coin looks similar to the one you're thinking of.
Can you not agree, was it rather spreading fauls foolingness* for example, the parish churches we're going to put down which actully caused rebellion No, it was the fact, that the abbeys were being suppressed and burned. It was 19th of Jan that after the King declared his Pardon and rebellion had ended. but I understood the King had also agreed to a free paliament where subjests could still show their grief complains my letter was only meant to I will tell you what it meant, my Lord.
I'm preparing bills for Parliament on the medical profession. And I'm trying to persuade His Majesty to appoint councillors based upon merit, and nothing else. You look tired, father. How is His Majesty? He's fine. His leg bothers him;

They all blame you to defend Eichmann, Hannah. Scoundrel, these are just a few articles in a magazine. Darling, you're really naïve. She thinks her sarcasm will protect. He shows me his vulnerability.
- A waste of time! - I love all our hand signals. I feel like all those deaf people that work at the stock exchange! And there's a new hand signal this year. Devil horns are for when you meet a rushee interested in Frannie's new sorority, Iota Kappa Iota.

Girls only wanna sleep with me because they read my book in high school. So? So they're not interested in me. They're interested in some idea of me. That's why you should keep working out.
- what do you mean? - Mosaic. All those leads I was running down. We should start following up on 'em now. Assuming your vision is even accurate,This  <hon>investigation<hoff>doesn't exist yet.
- You can't come in here. Come on, will you? Let us take just one flash. Now, gentlemen. I'd like to dismiss the charges against the Kirbys of disturbing the peace but they were present at the arrest and if these people were guilty then I must naturally assume that the Kirbys were guilty also. Your Honour, that's absurd.
But I've never actually thought of it as a yielding crop. But their potential even just as a fodder crop is huge. I'd never noticed before how much the cattle like eating ash. And there is also a wealth of fruits here and that's with doing nothing at all. With a bit of careful steering, who knows how much a hedge could produce.
We shouldn't even be seen talking together. Hey, she broke up with me. I don't even know if she ever loved me. Not the real me. I was just this gorgeous status accessory, like Paris Hilton's poodle.
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about  <hon>Doc Bull and the widow Cardmaker<hoff>. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
I've seen some low things in my time, but a mother who has just abandoned her child, going... That will stand alone in my memory as something revolting. Just one minute, Mr Merlin. Are you interested in knowing what I'm gonna do? Would it interest you to know that I am not the mother of that child?
People going around here bopping each other on the head, they need a phone. What is it? Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right. Thank you, Charlie. I can't stand another minute.
Let's start with the museum director. When Don Pedro Lucio Escalante de Mendoza came here, on 30th March 1612 to found the town of Jesus... y Montes Claros de los Caballeros del Vallegrande, he found the Spanish already established. In that square, the town was founded, and the Spanish flag was raised.

Where'd you come up with that, a fortune cookie? All right, all right. Get out of here before I remember that you weren't authorized to even think about going to Stark's factory. Except you. - Who, me? - I wanna talk to you. Let me show you something, Parker.
You do not know the coast! - Leave me in peace! - Are not you afraid of me? I can see if. That include women?
- It does not work, Merlyn! - It's too little. - Yes, that's less than we hoped. I hope better next time. Men are impatient and wondering where the money goes.
Just a couple of things, okay, sweetie? Okay. What about my turtle? We'll get the turtle. And you know what? What? My cousin told me where the key is.
C'mon! With regard to this loss, I think what you should do is to talk if you have something to say. Do not shy we would be happy to listen. Joss J'le not! I may know.

Would you like to see the rest or take a rest? The most patients are on the 2nd floor. The neuropsychological test are taken downhere... and the TAC scanners. What about this building? It's reserved to the most difficult cases.
I'll talk to him. In the meantime, we have other patients to attend. This case let me hooked since the beginning. The patient has nullified the senses of anxiety and fear. His anger is explosive and uncontrolled.
Let's do it. Stand back! There was a 1-in-5 chance that this could end badly, but that was a chance I was willing to take to get my life back to normal. I know what's causing the problem. The biocomputer has an ulcer.
- He's so gonna cry. - Step on him! - Get out of my way! - Relax, man. Are you OK?

So that I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in an honest way. You've gotta face facts. I've served our state well, haven't I? We have the lowest unemployment and the highest federal grants, but - - I've had to compromise. You can't count on people voting.
- Relax, man. Are you OK? You ever stare at the <hon>ceiling<hoff> till it started looking kind of funny? Like it was breathing. Like it was saying something.
You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right.  <hon>The cops<hoff> can make it plenty tough for you.
- Do you confess the bond? - I do. Then must the Jew be merciful. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. The quality of mercy is not strained, it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.

I thought I spotted Mr. Fred. Who's Mr. Fred? I met Mr. Fred the first time I fished this spot. I'd been out here an hour, maybe two, hadn't caught much. Then I felt this pull. Only stronger.
- A little bit-- - A bit more? There. Do you need anything else, dear? You sure?

Thank you! My friends will tell you that I have something of a... an addictive personality, my single greatest addiction being... to women. Mostly I... I want to seduce them. Which, of course, means sensing their vulnerabilities.

It's me who called you. What's the matter with A Rong? He's on the way here. And I'm one of his friends. Please give this to him. This bomb has a kind of sea-level device.
So be firm, Joe. Yes, Grandma. Now, why don't you let me slip down and tell Joe that his little bride will obey? She'll heed the word of her lord, master and save herself for him and his home and his children? Delia, I'm so tired of this argument.

What makes humans different from other animals? Feet. No, no. Come on, bears have feet. We're the only species on earth that observes "Shark Week." Sharks don't even observe "Shark Week," but we do.

All right,so... what is all this? I think I know how the blood drops got on the window? We both agree it wasn't a head injury. What about the gunshot wound? Well,the victim was on this side of the room-- there's no way the blood could have traveled that far.

She was understandably upset until my dad pointed out that I had covered it with rectangles within rectangles, retracing the Greeks' use of the golden ratio. Does that speak to the mathematician's need to understand beauty or to the child's need to tear it apart? People don't want to admit that the government's broken. That's a big idea. It's a scary idea.
Now, what was it you wanted to talk to me about? Nothing, nothing. Tricia Takanawa? What are you doing here? Peter, I'm standing here on your front porch, hoping to kill that dolphin with this harpoon.

Brady has the sword of Ellebra. A weapon he completely fetishizes. He takes it to the Judge's house, and then he kills her with some random knife? What are you getting at?

That is a very colorful way of putting it, Mr. Jenson. I might as well have stayed in Brooklyn.

Naturally you are entitled to your own opinion, Mr. Banning.
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot. I thought you said another foot!
I looked it up too. Weird. No, those meds you're taking. Without anxiety to keep your vanity in check, you are vulnerable to a syndrome called hyper-narcissosis. Okay, look. This apple is your ego.

Genevieve has been dead for some 24 years but... I have relived every moment of our happiness so many times. And my experience is entirely at your disposal, Bertram. Thank you, Oddly, but I really...

They all liked Victor for the job, but nobody could pin it on him. He and Pat Duffy were doing short time on weapons charges. Now, the press has been running the marine heist story nonstop, and the guys in Victor's crew are getting - leaned on by the cops. - Someone's going to crack.
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet.  <hon>Bateman<hoff>, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife.
I wouldn't doubt it. You are a fool, not that you're the only one. Plenty of others do the same thing. Well, what do us fools do? Boys like you, country boys, grow up on the farm, And the land gives them strength and happiness.

<hon>Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin.<hoff> Miss Franchette, do <hon>you reco<hoff>gnize these men? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?

(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often lovers think that they should hide their true feelings.

And what did you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. They insisted on following me. - What do you think  <hon>bodyguards<hoff> are for?
She'll watch out for us. - What's your favourite dish? - Probably venison. Mine's fish fingers. Why do you work in our nursery?

Yeah? So? It was news. So you're responsible for derailing his career. No.
Yet you bow and scrape toward Varinius' purpose. But aids me in pursuit of Spartacus. I would have done so as well. Absent attempt to fuck your sister. Magistrate. A word.
Plus she has a good support system. Her friends? Payson and Lauren? How supportive you think her friends will be if it comes down to them or Kaylie Cruz for a spot on the Olympic Team? These Rock girls are special.
How supportive you think her friends will be if it comes down to them or Kaylie Cruz for a spot on the Olympic Team? These Rock girls are special. They truly believe that, together, there is nothing they cannot achieve. - And I believe that, too. - Great.
Stay with us, Apple. GSW, I think it nicked the jugular from the amount of blood loss. BP is 70/40 and dropping. All right, keep up the pressure on the Venus. Give her four units.
All I'm talking about is a fresh start, a new chapter in your life. I don't know, Orson. It's such a massive change. I'd be saying good-bye to all my friends. You mean the women who involved you in a murder cover-up and then abandoned you?
Why would Susan need a nursery? You didn't tell her? I volunteered to look after the baby so Porter could start that new restaurant job. He said you didn't want to be stuck taking care of her all the time, and I'm thrilled to do it. That's... really nice of you.
I shudder to ask, but how is that relevant? Tao: Buzz, get the lights. [ Switch clicks ] You see, Epsom is magnesium sulfate, shows up under the ultraviolet. See, it splashed up on the curtains, on the walls, suggesting there had been a struggle. Buzz, you were right about the hair dryer.
Put the "naughty" in "nautical." Village people did it with a song. We'll change it in court. I understand the jag is offering to take the discharge Off the table in exchange for a guilty plea. I don't think our clients want that.
And then it'll fall to us to feed it and clean up after it... Honey, I am well aware of that. Clip his little toenails. Well, hopefully, we can outsource that. It's amazing.
No, no, no, I found the wallet and I swear, I-I took the money but I never looked inside. Ain't know that wallet belonged to Mr. Kelvin. Yo, watch where you going! Did you get a good look at the guy who bumped you? Nah, he was a brother, though, tall, with his hoodie pulled down tight.
The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night.
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing. For god's sakes, play something! Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all. He says... "The 2  <hon>women<hoff> are standing "facing each other in dead silence.
I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose  <hon>wedding<hoff> is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just tryi <hon>ng to<hoff> help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way my folks used to live.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why a hand has five fingers?
The wall was an Israeli decision, an Israeli disease. It was built under Israeli pressure. They didn't decide to build a wall, the Israelis did. I think it's very obvious that it's a serious symptom of an Israeli disease. The Palestinians don't play an active role. They endure it. -Precisely. There are Palestinians in my film, but this is much more a film about the Israelis. In this case, the Palestinians are the passive party.
Feel free to try. What do the others think? All right. -Then it's agreed. The other change involves the exotic nature of tonight's dinner.
- What? - That's so weak! - Weak! Drink it! - That calls for a penalty drink Wait One more chance!
Gosh, he's cute and intelligent. Isn't he too perfect? He seems very nice, but... you know what? Why not?  <hon>Guys<hoff> all seem nice at first.
Don't lose hope Excuse my language, but do you Mullahs have to preach all the time? No, we're not the only ones who preach Listen! People buy everything from stores
- Thanks, I've already had some - What was the number? - 20 What happened, Ozra? Tonight, after so many years I got reminded of my parents
It's good for people to become tamed, isn't it? No need for that anymore There is no one in this world who doesn't have a path to reach God You have to have a pure soul You can't force people into heaven, dear brother!
Actually reciting a song helps your digestion Please I have sprinkled water in the streets so there is no dust when he comes Well done Excuse me, Hajji, but I hope this music is not profane
Ηow dare you hit my papa? I didn't know he was your father. Αnd that kid.. What kid? Ηer mother is here, there are so many people around..
The guard, after frisking her, tells her she can cross without the bag or turn back. Without thinking twice, she says she'll cross if he saves the bag until she returns. The guard asks what's in the bag and she says it's only her heart. The guard asks her if she isn't afraid of leaving it. As long as no one opens the bag, there's no danger. The guard asks her what would happen if anyone opened it.
You cannot do that. The one who revealed man as the sole conditional... did not teach betrayal... did not teach humiliation... did not teach usurping. Man was taught to help. Poverty is no good, but rules are. To spare, to save is wonderful. He who saves will always have.
One of those being that the Tin Man had a rivet between his eyes that nobody had seen in 50 years. Maybe there's some detail in this film that we're not seeing. There's only one way to find out. I'll send this to FotoKem, have them do a wet print and rescan it. January 2001.

And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why a hand has five fingers?
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about Doc Bull and the widow Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right. The cops can make it plenty tough for you.
You're breaking my heart. - Shut up. I can't say much for the women though. But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21. Before that, they're... But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown? Oh yes, they're dark.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well, the horses look good.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our girls are all well-behaved.
Are you enjoying yourself this summer? Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement. Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. - Well, I'll try not to if you say so. - No.
Oh, I mean it, all right. I think you're off on the wrong tack, Regi. I wish I could show you how valueless money is. You can't. I know what love can get you into.
There are burglars singing in the cellar. Burglars singing in the cellar! Yeah, there's burglars singing in the cellar! Great big fellows, about eight feet tall... They sound like...
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot. I thought you said another foot!
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife.
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked thing doing?
Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new alarm clock last week. It carried a five year guarantee.
That's impossible. Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case. - What about it, Whitely? - I can explain that, Inspector. I knew Barelli had sent flowers to the theater this afternoon.
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin. Miss Franchette, do you recognize these men? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?
Yes, madame, sometimes I am dizzy with the beauty of my own thoughts. Perhaps the sun has something to do with it. This sun is nothing. Wait till you get beyond the mountains... and through the gates of the Sahara. There the sun blazes.
(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often lovers think that they should hide their true feelings.
And what did you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. They insisted on following me. - What do you think bodyguards are for?
If poor Father ever... - Where are you going? - To show Bubbles. - Come here. - What? - Are you crazy?
What is this, a prison ship? It ain't healthy. Detectives don't worry me, and I'll take care of Darcy. Are you gonna slap the mug and ask for the next dance? There's only one way to handle these shakedown guys.
So people can drink their eight glasses a day. You are crazy. People do not drink the ocean! Fish do. Fish are not people!
My God. At least take a look at the girl first! In the end, you may even like her! So... okay? Well, good.
If you don't want it, the cops will. I think they're going to like to know you're in New York. Hot, ain't it? Hey, you ain't seen that kid around anyplace, have you? Old Man Griswald's gonna have quintuplets if he ain't found.
Military witnesses may be called provided the defense does not violate their professional secrecy. Attendant, conduct the witnesses to their room. - What about the Dreyfus case? - Referencing it will not be allowed. Mr. President, if Dreyfus was justly condemned a full inquiry now would give that condemnation increased weight and we would lose our case.
No. They were either too busy or too afraid. Out of all the teeming millions of this great city only five girls had the courage to take their very lives in their hands and accuse Johnny Vanning. In spite of all threats of reprisals, the horror of which they knew too well they were ready to appear before you to testify. And let me be the first to admit the truth of the accusations that were brought against these girls in a desperate effort to discredit them.
Betty, I want you to tell me the truth. I wanna know why you're not going back to school. All right, I'll tell you. I can't. Don't you think my friends have read the papers?
Dances come and dances go, but whether slow or hot, very soon the latest dance... But if any of you were alive in 1785 You remember how people were shocked and aghast At a thing called the waltz It was too, too risque.
I'll watch the pressure. Watch the pressure. No air was gonna hurt anything. What are you up to now? I told you to watch that tire! I'm dreadfully sorry.
- You can't come in here. Come on, will you? Let us take just one flash. Now, gentlemen. I'd like to dismiss the charges against the Kirbys of disturbing the peace but they were present at the arrest and if these people were guilty then I must naturally assume that the Kirbys were guilty also. Your Honour, that's absurd.
I've seen some low things in my time, but a mother who has just abandoned her child, going... That will stand alone in my memory as something revolting. Just one minute, Mr Merlin. Are you interested in knowing what I'm gonna do? Would it interest you to know that I am not the mother of that child?
People going around here bopping each other on the head, they need a phone. What is it? Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right. Thank you, Charlie. I can't stand another minute.
You do not know the coast! - Leave me in peace! - Are not you afraid of me? I can see if. That include women?
- It does not work, Merlyn! - It's too little. - Yes, that's less than we hoped. I hope better next time. Men are impatient and wondering where the money goes.
C'mon! With regard to this loss, I think what you should do is to talk if you have something to say. Do not shy we would be happy to listen. Joss J'le not! I may know.
The government's got enough on its hands already without... That's great. The government's putting dough in too many places. Senator, what do you think of the girls in this town? Four of them came up and kissed me when I got off the train.
So that I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in an honest way. You've gotta face facts. I've served our state well, haven't I? We have the lowest unemployment and the highest federal grants, but - - I've had to compromise. You can't count on people voting.
- but there's a suite with a private safe. - That's even better. - But, gentlemen, I'm afraid-- - He's always afraid. I just wanted to explain.
Of course. Because tonight it is just like Dr. Lanskell said I am much too happy. And I'm just a little afraid, though I pretended I wasn't. It's been so hectic since you adopted me and Lanning's parents decided we might get married. They've been very sweet to me.
So be firm, Joe. Yes, Grandma. Now, why don't you let me slip down and tell Joe that his little bride will obey? She'll heed the word of her lord, master and save herself for him and his home and his children? Delia, I'm so tired of this argument.
"I chatter, chatter as I flow "To join the brimming river "For men may come and men may go But I go on forever." The Cannon brain remembers this hotel.
Isn't this your watch, Driscoll? Yes, sir, but Yank was fearing to be alone and... - Well, that's all right, Driscoll. - Thank you, sir. Did he take the medicine I sent?
That is a very colorful way of putting it, Mr. Jenson. I might as well have stayed in Brooklyn. That gutter was paved with the good intentions... of many enthusiastic but mistaken young archaeologists. Pardon me, professor, but I'm inclined to disagree with you. Naturally you are entitled to your own opinion, Mr. Banning.
- Yes, I've come back home again. Bijou is home again. Please, my heart is not so good. But you look new. The place, it looks new and nice.
Well, it's about time. I thought you two had amnesia and forgot where you parked me. Hold the phone, Sugie. Dropping me on the doorstep like a throwaway for a credit dentist. - You said it was for one night. - Sugie, for snap's sake. You're as hot as a pistol. The DA's got 100 men on the job.
Genevieve has been dead for some 24 years but... I have relived every moment of our happiness so many times. And my experience is entirely at your disposal, Bertram. Thank you, Oddly, but I really... I judge I do not have to start with basic principles. Being a botanist, I find an astonishing parallel between a woman's heart and the wind flower or Anemone nemorosa.
I wouldn't doubt it. You are a fool, not that you're the only one. Plenty of others do the same thing. Well, what do us fools do? Boys like you, country boys, grow up on the farm, And the land gives them strength and happiness.
─ It was from their landlady. Emily and Louisa had been .. a little difficult. She had sent for the Police. They were going to be put away in an institution. The landlady was quite right.
Put me down this instant. Now, you know I've had enough to drink, Jeff, and so have you. Jeff, are you hurt? Don't talk so loud. Let me help you up. My, aren't you strong?
Of all the people. And it must be fought not only on the battlefield but in the cities and in the villages. In the factories and on the farms. In the home and in the heart of every man, woman and child who loves freedom. Well, we have buried our dead but we shall not forget them.
Go and tell them I want that decision at once. Yes, milady. - Have you seen old Ballard's rose? - No, I haven't. That's a lie.
- Well, thank heavens for something. That name! Then it's the Jeffers Airport. That's it, isn't it? Are you still talking about that airport? You really take it on the chin, don't you? Why not?
No, gentlemen. What you have heard is a girl caught hopelessly between two men... who have fought over her as dogs fight over a bone. I object to this... Sustained. Didn't you play these men one against the other... encouraging each in turn?
His orders will be carried out to the letter. If not to the spirit. Here we are. - Who are you? - Military police, 7th Detail, Herr General. You will come with Colonel Niedecker and me.
Why do we have to leave our gun? Don't ask me. I don't know. Range: 7-0-5-0.
A chain of mysterious workings. A broken link damages the following one! A "chain"? It's curious that you mentioned that word. I'm also part of a chain, reduced to several men.
Let's go! No time to waste! We have to sit tight and stay behind him. Try to overtake. The fumes are bothering me. Close the window. From now on, I'll have to be especially careful.
- Mange? Poor woman. - Not the woman, the dog! Then I went off to repair the clock at the chemist's. It really needed it.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard's another matter. A caged animal traveling around with Charlie How-Come for years and years. - That's why it kills human beings. It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
If some man is upsetting you, pitch him out of your life. Music is first. Music is everything. I understand. You don't understand. Women never understand.
Those blank cartridges were a cheap sort of trick. I grant you. But it wasn't easy to let you take my gun away from me without seeming to hand it to you. That's why I let you take the torch first. I knew you'd snap it off. Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk.
Otherwise life is at an end for you. You are playing with fire, Bernadette. - Commissioner, that spring at the grotto... - Yeah? The people are drinking quite a bit of that water, aren't they? By the bucketful.
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about  <hon>Doc Bull < <hon>hoff><hoff>  and the widow Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
Both. I ate my program. Oh, Leon, I forgot to buy her a present. - Ajeweler open till midnight? - Yes.
Or is it I who am mad? I'm always losing things and hiding things. I can never find them. I don't know where I put them. That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
- Everybody wants to be Mayor. Everybody but me. With me it's just civic pride. Look what you're doing. Soldiers coming back can upset a balance that has taken years to adjust. You're telling me.
Everything will be all right. Everyone passed! Well, boys... this period in your life has now come to an end. You'll now step out and see what life has to offer. I hope you will do your old school proud.
My congratulations, McPherson. Listen to my broadcast in 15 minutes. I'm discussing great lovers of history. It was the most difficult thing I ever had to do in my whole life. All I need is the gun. What are you doing? Do you know the combination to this thing?
What is it, madame? - Who are those men? - I don't know, I've never seen them before. - Where are they from? - I didn't ask.

Four bells and all's well. According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar. And strangely enough, that's just where he is. He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin. One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
Don't bother me. I get it! - Stay where you are! - I shan't move an inch. Neither will I till the light comes on.
- Yes, I defended  <hon>him<hoff>. Some might say I lost the case for him. I read the newspapers, but somehow I never could make head nor tail of it. Well, there were some things that couldn't be told in the courtroom. Yet, of all the people involved, I suppose I'm the only one who knew the whole story.

The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
Everything will be all right. Everyone passed! Well, boys... this period in your life has now come to an end. You'll now step out and see what life has to offer. I hope you will do your old school proud.
And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why  <hon>a hand<hoff> has five fingers?
- I will. That old- Still,  <hon>she<hoff>'s right about Do <hon>c Bull<hoff> and the widow Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
My congratulations, McPherson. Listen to my broadcast in 15 minutes. I'm discussing great lovers of history. It was the most difficult thing I ever had to do in my whole life. All I need is the gun. What are you doing? Do you know the combination to this thing?
What is it, madame? - Who are those men? - I don't know, I've never seen them before. - Where are they from? - I didn't ask.

Four bells and all's well. According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar. And strangely enough, that's just where he is. He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin. One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
Don't bother me. I get it! - Stay where you are! - I shan't move an inch. Neither will I till the light comes on.
- Yes, I defended him. Some might say I lost the case for  <hon>him<hoff>. I read the newspapers, but somehow I never could make head nor tail of it. Well, there were some things that couldn't be told in the courtroom. Yet, of all the people involved, I suppose I'm the only one who knew the whole story.
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way my folks used to live.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?

You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right. The cops can make it plenty tough for you.
You're breaking my heart. - Shut up. I can't say much for the women though. But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21. Before that, they're... But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown? Oh yes, they're dark.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well, the horses look good.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our girls are all well-behaved.
Are you enjoying yourself this summer? Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement. Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. - Well, I'll try not to if you say so. - No.
Oh, I mean it, all right. I think you're off on the wrong tack, Regi. I wish I could show you how valueless money is. You can't. I know what love can get you into.
There are burglars singing in the cellar. Burglars singing in the cellar! Yeah, there's burglars singing in the cellar! Great big fellows, about eight feet tall... They sound like...
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot. I thought you said another foot!
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife.
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked thing doing?
Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new alarm clock last week. It carried a five year guarantee.
That's impossible. Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case. - What about it, Whitely? - I can explain that, Inspector. I knew Barelli had sent flowers to the theater this afternoon.
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin. Miss Franchette, do you recognize these men? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?
Yes, madame, sometimes I am dizzy with the beauty of my own thoughts. Perhaps the sun has something to do with it. This sun is nothing. Wait till you get beyond the mountains... and through the gates of the Sahara. There the sun blazes.
(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often lovers think that they should hide their true feelings.
And what did you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. They insisted on following me. - What do you think bodyguards are for?
You'll enjoy it here. Say, all those girls you worked with... It's a strange job isn't it? Yes, kind of. To start with, they love sex, right? It helps.
The ultimate protest. - Totally? - Yes, let's be mute. So, let's be mute. When people demonstrated in May 68, it was beautiful, romantic.
So, um... Is everything...? - Was dinner...? - No, no, dinner was great. The lamb and risotto, everything was fabulous. I overcooked the risotto, it was a little gummy.
I drink water, lots of water. It's good for you. Want some? Thank you, Marianne. The information you give me now is for the local authorities.
-What kind of a woman is she? -What are you doing? Making sure she's a natural blond, that's all. Leave her alone. We don't know what she'll do.

- Where are you from? - Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires! Home to the women with the nicest asses around. They're really spectacular.
Along the Delta. It's Sunday. We'll get some sun. We can... My parents have a house out there. We'll have lunch together.
Yes, you! You poor excuse for death! Small-town morgue night watchman! Give me the piece. What you offered me yesterday.
No, I'm serious. Something very cool is happening to me. -Why doesn't she play dead? -Why? Spiders like their prey alive.
- Smith. Elizabeth, I'd like you to meet my deputy, Lieutenant Patrick Smith. How do you do, Lieutenant Smith? - Pleased to meet you. Gentlemen. My people haven't worshipped at the Siddheshwar temple for the past three years.
- Don't be afraid. Say a prayer and go. All right, gentlemen. We remember this chap, don't we? Oh, dear. Last man in and he's severely disabled. Now, only the last batsman is left.

Inscrutable you. You're a mystery to me... [Brakhage] So I had the great honor to live with them as their friend, with her and Teiji. They took me in like a bird with a broken wing... which was not far from what I was, and sheltered me for several months. So if this film comes out okay... as I hope it will, I will call it Water for Maya. This is music for the eyes for Maya... but it's ritual also.
If Atanarjuat needs help, why don't you go with him? My clothes are all new. I'm sure I'll be okay. Not for long! The caribou are very far.
Come on, I haven't got long Excuse me That thing... it's here! The ghost from the housing estate, I told you about it I think it's here to get you
We must use super pure water in order to prevent the light from degrading. Question. Is this water drinkable? Yes, but it would taste terrible. Why is that?
Right there. They could find coins and very ancient things. They say they used to bury them with all their things. - Their belongings. - Money, at least. Look for gold!
Do you read minds? With you, I seem to. With you, I can't. You imagine I think in Russian? Masculine intuition.
Don't be my stepmother Daddy says stepmothers eat boys Traitor! I'll curse you all You'll never know women's love
The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night.
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing. For god's sakes, play something! Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all. He says... "The 2 women are standing "facing each other in dead silence.
I'll tell you which cab to take. Hey. Whose wedding is this, yours or mine? Oh, Edna's just trying to help us, Eddie. You wasn't on the other side when they had the war, were ya? - No. What's the answer?

It frightened me. All the images of my future are gone. I have to drink the Water of Life. No, Paul, please. I've seen the men who have tried.
Soon, she will be struck by the truth! The short but terrible insight... the breakdown. My face! I stink like a rotten fish! My skin pours out some moisture that smells like shit...
Look, she's dancing around like crazy. Maybe she's lost from her family. Like us. All our families are split up. Even Wicket's .
I wanna tell you something. You know that school where I teach may not be good but it's gonna grow. - So? - So... - We're gonna make some money. - How? I'll show you.
Here, at the Atlanta Genital institute teams of doctors are at work around the clock to cure this dreaded affliction. Hi, I'm Dr. Zillman, and I'd like to talk to you about your testes. The human testicle is like a balloon. Sometimes, it is empty. And sometimes... it is full.
Even if they did behave badly, this was inhuman treatment. They were isolated in the last cell block, known as the punishment block, on concrete beds, with almost no light. You'd see mulatto women, whose skin was quite dark. They'd be confined to that block for 25, 30, 45 days, depending on the sentence that was given them by the wardens. When they came out, their skin was white. They were so pale and skinny,
Cuban homosexuals soon got wise to the system. They pretended to be excited by the women. "What sexy broads!" And when the man with the erection appeared, "How could I ever look at that!"
CSI Three Greg Sanders, meet Defense Criminalist Jennifer Rhodes. Ms. Rhodes is here to review the evidence on People v.Gus Ellis, 2006. Yeah, that, uh, doesn't ring a bell. Ms. Rhodes, wh-why don't you give us the Reader's Digest version. Gus Ellis served seven years of a life sentence for the rape/murder of college student Claire Gibson.
Men are infinitely malleable. Or perhaps you've returned to your old idea that the proletarians will arise. Put it out of your mind. They are helpless animals. Humanity is the body.
Now I am cured. I ask only for you to accept my love of our leader. I ask only to be shot while my mind is still clean. A glorious victory! A vast, strategic maneuver to outflank... the Eurasian Forces on the African front has been successful.
For me there are two concepts: Anxiety and love. If we have hitherto lived under the fear concept ... then it's time to get that solved ... and lead us to turn the love. Deep love for the true nature of a person. Where you are no longer afraid of the differences ... anyone want to know true.
- You didn't run any sine-x's. - No tests. Processed it on my 12, just like you specified... but if this don't come out, don't go chewing my ass. Who'd you catch this time? Not allowed to tell.

The prophecy. The boy is my undoing. But he's also my grandson. I must save him. I understand.
How am I ruining anything? I'm just trying to help you make better jewelry. But this isn't about the jewelry. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings. Since when can't you open up with me?

Having deserted my elector and employer, George Frederick of Hanover, imagine my embarrassment when the same George Frederick succeeds to the throne of England as good King George I, Was I to be strung up by me toenails? Was my defection punishable by death? It was my old and trusted friend, Baron Kielmansegge, the Elector's Master of the Horse, who suggested how I might abase myself to restore my good name, although I doubt if even he could have reckoned upon the outcome, My music proved to be a great dampener,
Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way my  <hon>folks<hoff> used to live.

But didn't you just buy the Gold Madonna from my friends the Ralstons? - Where'd you hear that? - [Chuckles] Then it's not true. - Well, I didn't think so... - All right, Belle, if you must know... I did buy the Madonna last week. [Lighter Snapping]
And from whom? From what? - You and I have the same first name. - I think about that all the time. We must let him know his family is doing very well.
- It's nothing personal. - It absolutely is personal. That is the definition of "personal." "The definition of personal." Excuse me, we have an issue.
I'll never be as fine as you two, but I can say now, Susy Bell - Ladieswear. Well, that's fine enough for me. There you are!

A German, Peter Scholz and Felix Krün, an Austrian, perishes several years after. My brother died during this expedition in the Nanga Parbat. Later, in 1972, I was in the Manaslu, to Nepal... a member of the expedition died of just cold weather under the summit and another became madman and perishes also him. During all these years, I met some mountaineers, I learned two or three years later than they had died ...in big expeditions. I think that the fact to want to climb some mountains is a sign of cerebral degeneration.
Those of the great geniuses are wine. Everybody drinks water. Let me see. There are a number of things I need to tell you before I go. Always obey your parents.

Specifically, it will have the ability to anticipate acts of aggression and suggest strategic countermeasures before the perpetrators can act. It sounds like quite a project.

How would you take to go a drink somewhere? It's nice to offer but I am a little tired. I spent a day hell to the department. They want to get rid General Von Blaumberg. Two weeks ago they were all at her wedding.
Open the door! I knew they would. I'm ready. Louise, write your story. When the pain is gone.
Different department. I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They said you have a form I need to fill out. - Have you got an arrest receipt? - Yeah.

Thank God you're okay. Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did. Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done. I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them. Unfortunately, they will.
Well, since you can't freeze us, you probably can't blow us up either. Just keep your hands where we can see them. All right, so the Banshee. Well, they're pretty rare. But what they do is hunt for their victims with a high-pitched call, something beyond our range to hear.
I'm gonna call the police. So they had no costumes? Right, they had no costumes, and for some reason, that really upset him. You sure there were no costumes? 'Cause sometimes they can be very subtle costumes.
Maybe we ought to just stay put. They haven't gotten into the house yet. They will. We could board up the place. We could make it stronger. Helen, these things are vicious.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well, the  <hon>horses<hoff>look good.
You never know what you're gonna find next. We miss Earth. But hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home. Captain Archer, out. How'd it go?
Huh? You planned this whole thing! What thing? This "Get Robert jealous" thing. Please. Why would I do that?
I'm buying! Tiramisu for everybody! Fall in! Hold on! Hold it! Hold it!
That's all right. We'll just be going. Okay, all right. Thank you. God bless you. I'll see you Sunday. I'm gonna bring the pig! Nuns, right? What's going on?
You two goin' a couple of rounds? Dad, please, just-- Don't be too hard on him, Deb. Robert told me he did the right thing. He shot her down real quick.
Do this, or the bucket floats and comes up empty. Like that it'll sink. See? How is your roof? I'm short a few tiles. I forgot to order them.
What? Don't try to get me to change my mind, okay? I see you're firing up all the pistons in your little guilt machine. I don't have a guilt machine, Raymond. All I have is the hope that our family could be happy.
Old man Camoins had dug a ditch... that led down to the end of that field there. That way the water just ran downhill by itself. Understand? Look. See the soggy ground around my foot?
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for  <hon>turtle<hoff>soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our  <hon>girls<hoff>are all well-behaved.
Which is why I had to find them first. Naberius, where is he? Police! Put down your weapon! Good evening, Mr. Wessex.
Are you enjoying yourself this summer? Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement. Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. - Well, I'll try not to if you say so. - No.
Oh, I mean it, all right. I think you're off on the wrong tack, Regi. I wish I could show you how valueless money is. You can't. I know what  <hon>love<hoff>can get you into.
There are burglars singing in the cellar. Burglars singing in the cellar! Yeah, there's burglars singing in the cellar! Great big  <hon>fellows<hoff>, about eight feet tall... They sound like...
What you believe. The schism, the new learning, the nature of the sacraments. - Do you really want to know? - I really want to know. Well... It's our belief that faith only saves.
Hey, John Doe! You fucking want me? Come fucking get me! Stop sending your boys! Those three boys in the car park... it went horribly wrong for them.
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot.  <hon>I thought you said another foot!<hoff>
It's not really justice, is it? Well, it seems to be working. Oh, so... bring back capital punishment, the noose, firing squad? I never said that. Look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to have all the answers, Ken.
Thank you. Thank you. Must have been excruciating for him. I think part of him wanted to... embrace her, wanted to connect with her. But, in order to do that, to let the wall down, well...
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make  <hon>him<hoff>comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife.
They feel threatened. They leave you alone or they try to push you around. Sounds like every Saturday night I've had for the last year. - How do you know so much? - Because I listen to women. Is that how you keep all those women happy, by listening to them?
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked  <hon>thing<hoff>doing?
Yeah! Tried to kill another whore! Who's gonna be next? Get outta here or both you are going in for assault, all right? All of you. Hang in there, all right? The ambulance is on its way. These people have a serious problem.
Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new  <hon>alarm clock<hoff> last week. It carried a five year guarantee.
Where? Library of Congress. Twenty-five minutes. He won't make it in time. Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later. Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week. And lose a week?
Everyone respected us. It didn't last, but don't blame me. That's fate. There's no such thing as fate. Good-for-nothings always blame fate! It was the fault of our elders.
That's impossible. Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case. - What about it, Whitely? - I can explain that, Inspector. I knew Barelli had sent  <hon>flowers<hoff>to the theater this afternoon.
One Police Plaza does. They asked me to take it, I said "yes". To polish your political apple? It's delicate territory and you're familiar with the players. I'll fill Homicide in. You go talk to the parents.
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin. Miss Franchette, do you recognize these  <hon>men<hoff>? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?
She wasn't really making a whole lot of sense. That's because she was trying to protect me. Tell us. I counseled Thomas Marchek for four months. And he told me he wasn't being intimate with anyone.
Yes, madame, sometimes I am dizzy with the beauty of my own thoughts. Perhaps the sun has something to do with it. This sun is nothing. Wait till you get beyond the mountains... and through the gates of the Sahara. There the  <hon>sun<hoff>blazes.
I just thought you were evil, but you are nuts! What are you talking about? Grandma, gifts aren't conditional. You give them to people because you love them! They're not something you can take away because of some petty slight!
(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often  <hon>lovers<hoff>think that they should hide their true feelings.
Before he was killed Dex confirmed to me that Viktor Dragovic is here in Jersey. Now thanks to shared bi-lateral intelligence by the Royal Thai Police, we know why. Better. We know where. Our target is the ship The Cambodian Star.
I don't know. Rouge is called blush now. Madness. Madness. Why are all those guys so excited about photosynthesis?
And what did you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. They insisted on following me. - What do you think  <hon>bodyguards<hoff>are for?
Look! Look over there! I see him! None of us could breathe. Somewhere under those bushes was the rest of Ray Brower.
Intrepid, aren't you... Well, help yourself. Thank you. Grandpa, do you always stay underground? That's impossible! Since last night, the stones have been making a mysterious commotion...
- Don't come in! Not yet! - Hang on! I know what you're doing, you're wrapping presents! OK. I can't find the good ornaments.
They need, huh-- their grand mother whipping their ass like... like I had. Yeah, a good slap. You know, it kind of sounds like you guys are blaming everybody but these kids. I mean, you don't get a by just 'cause you grew up here and your parents were on drugs... Those kids are perfectly capable of telling the  <hon>difference<hoff>between a wild night out and... beating somebody to death.
You're tired. Why don't you come inside? Because there is a bottle of chardonnay in the refrigerator, and right now, this little chore is the only thing that's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing. Well... The  <hon>azaleas<hoff>really are lovely.
You all set, Zoe? No, I am not. And please don't start telling me how nothing is going to change just 'cause you're getting married. Because I'm upset that I can't find my little mirror, and I really need it. This little mirror?
It could be a while... Here we go, fourth time's the charm. And how long was it before Doctor Kovac came to your bedside? It was more than an hour. I saw him working on the computer, he was talking to some nurses, then... he ate a  <hon>bagel<hoff>with cream cheese.
I have a cell phone, Dr. Saroyan. I found evidence of a perforation in the membrane of her lungs. That could be connected to the T-3 and T-4 vertebrae damage. Exactly what I thought. Could it have been pierced by a rib during the attack? The  <hon>ribs<hoff>were not broken pre-explosion.
You sure  <hon>these<hoff>are different enough to register with the mass spec ? Yeah. Detergents and additives, they vary from brand to brand. Okay, so what if some of these guys use the same brand ? Then we rely on the bikes.
Bye. Great, great. I got one, I got one, here, look. Oh, yeah, I love it, I love her. Oh god, how she looks, isn't she pretty.
The doll. What doll? The doll we sold. The doll in the vault. What are you talking about?
He said... "I love this song, turn it up. Then what ? Then he... rolled down the window and listened to it. What  <hon>song<hoff>was it ?
He's the worst assistant I've ever had. He gets numbers wrong, he screws up appointments. I'm hosting the regional conference of the Wardens Association next week, and he has managed to mangle every detail. So get another prisoner to assist you. Who? How many drug dealers can use Excel? Hire someone from outside.
- No. Not only do I have to become the perfect lawyer, I have to be an ideal husband and father. - Because I fucked it all up. - Jesus, that's not what I meant. That's the way Mother and Dad feel, especially since the kidnapping, especially since I told them I was fucking another man.
If everyone starts praying in his own way, where will we be? What will be left of the church? Father Filaret, you've got nice  <hon>boots<hoff>. You like them? Very.
Everything you taught me about poker, it all worked. And you are gonna get the greatest thank you gift ever. Lava lamp. I am gonna fix that stupid car of yours. My  <hon>car<hoff>is fine.
Poet told them about the videotapes that Adebisi made. Christ. Yeah, and they're trying to verify that the tapes exist. - Maybe we should pull the plug. - l can't do that.
They seem to be focusing on one particular girl. Not every human is a candidate for hybridization. The genetic structure has to have... well, you would call it a flaw. It's very rare on Earth, fewer than one in 50 million people have it.
- Base out. - Rescue Team One out. They said that they were taking a chance just having us here looking for your friend. I could only get a couple more minutes. I'm sorry. What I had was a parachute.
Warnings about the consequences of their work. Like this? "Dormitories of mediocre minds filled with insidious promises and empty lies." So, that's the great  <hon>Gordon Greyson<hoff>. Incredible.
- Yes, Doctor? - The vaccine. I'm a physician, I've seen death, but not on the scale this could mean. You were testing if you could replicate the vaccine. And we can't.
Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation. Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it. You could give the money to the orphanage.
Can you identify the origin of the infection? They had reached Earth's late 20th-century level of knowledge. That's all you need if you're a fool. A deadly, infectious virus which is not difficult to grow. We learnt the story in training.
You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one does anything uncomfortable to them. Come! Our people will want to know you.

Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down. Would you care to comment privately on how you read any of this? Unnecessary. These people are honest, almost to a fault.
- No fucking way! - Excuse me. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - You're coming back, right? - I don't think so.
I'm going crazy because Tra vis hasn't called me. My father's going crazy on the Internet with his new screen name, Hotbod. Riley's going crazy because she's been shot down by Larry. And Mom's on the tennis court trying to be one of the Williams sisters. I think I finally ha ve the topic for my column.
Yes. Everything fits... His connection to his grandparents, His love of sports, his artistic talent? - Well... - Well?
First we determine where to best place the wire. Then the listening device will be fabricated and we install it. See that they limit both entrances to the basement. It's not a Better Homes and Gardens tour. Happy hunting.
His behavior is irrational. To you, maybe, but you haven't lived like we have. No, but that doesn't mean that we're responsible for what's happened here. You can't deny your people sent the probe. They made an error in judgment.

- It's now or never. Are you going to let me down any time soon? Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag. As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the janitor learnt nothing from this experience. Dr Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there.
Well, they're certainly doing a bang-up job.Objection. Withdrawn. How much did you  <hon>earn<hoff>last year, Mr. Pruitt? I have no idea. Must be nice.
Ijust had to know. One week should be more than enough time to run the proper pre-test simulation. Sirs, if I may, I think we should wait. You think we should wait? You're the one who figured out how to use the naqahdah reactor to power this device. Because General Hammond ordered me to.
Mm-hmm. I think we all should just go there. You know, tell the truth, Spit it out, Go with your gut, Follow your instincts. I miss philandering whore Meredith. She was trashy and much less idyllic. Do  <hon>women<hoff>have two sets of panties?
Yes, sir. A rocket? With a payload of the superheavy element. We send it in stages through the Stargate to K'Tau and assemble it there. When it's complete, we launch it into their sun.
Yeah, nothing. The onlyhing that we have to go on for the passenger in the tollbooth is the five-dollar bill. Yeah, well, the blood on the bill didn't match Leslie Anderson or the DNA from Jill Girrard's hairbrush. So there's a chance our mystery girl could be one of  <hon>these<hoff>. Yeah.
And don't leave out any details. Well, I'm thinking about changing the wall colors from yellow to deep salmon. Perhaps a goldenrod trimmer around the first layer of wainscot... You just keep your laws off our bodies! Respect a woman's choice!
Laura, I need to talk to you right now! Not if it's about canceling our dinner! It wasn't about canceling our dinner, so there! OK, I'm sorry. What do you wanna talk about?
Please. No... Classy touch, James. Nothing sexier than a French whore. Speaking of which, I could use a little divertissement.
Come on now, get away from the road. You wanna get caught? I saw you checking out those  <hon>girls<hoff>back at the diner. - What? - Come on, fess up.
Obviously, that's the bad news. - Yeah. - Good news is that more people will be eligible for benefits. - And taxpayers are nuts about that. Back to the bad news, 4 million people became poor on the president's watch?
- You ever seen anything like this before? - He's a minor. This is uncharted territory. - I gotta tell you something. - What?
The sole memory I have of her is being covered in it. I need to know more details. I hope that look means you found something on Batista's  <hon>shirt<hoff>. You should see this. That's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?
I wouldn't worry about it. Agriculture isn't really your field. Agriculture is responsible for one in five American jobs, so it is a bit my field. Fifteen percent of the world's cotton, 25 percent of the world's beef and 50 percent of the world's soybeans are grown in my field. Farmers pay taxes in my field, their kids go to school in my field they go to jail in my field.
- Where? - Here. That's a bit of a dilemma. Does anybody have room at their place for Bazan and 60 of his relatives? Any amnesty conditions could be in violation of Hague treaties. Yeah.
-Well, then attend it I shall. -Okay. T om. It is with pleasure that I present Lord John Marbury of Great Britain. And by request of the secretary of state, ask you to accept his credentials from Her Royal Majesty Queen elizabeth II as Great Britain's ambassador to the United States. Where are you on the missile shield? Well, I think it's dangerous, illegal fiscally irresponsible, technologically unsound and a threat to all people everywhere.
And it was modest. I said that "There seems to be harmony in nature. How do you feel about that? " He said, "Yes. The  <hon>Universe<hoff>is lawful. But harmony, I don't know what you mean by that.
I've got nothin', but time. - ? ? crazy. - That's crazy. I dunno. We're all in some kind of hell.
In other words, on a highway, or anywhere were two cars might hit each other, the electronic sensors would sense the distance automatically and keep the cars from sideswiping or making contact at all. Now even if they did impinge a slight dent in the car, the car will be made up of the memory materials, shape memory alloys, that go back to their original shape, even when dented. I'm going to take this metal called Nitinol. This  <hon>wire<hoff>or spring is wound around a mandrel and heated to a specific temperature and held until it cools. Then, when you pull it out beyond its elastic limit, so it's not about to return because of spring-shape, and then deform it in many different ways.
- Oh, God! Seventeen years, three months and five days. That's a long time to wait for some tit. Without an atmosphere... the Earth would be a far different place. It might look like the moon. Our exploration of the moon showed us that it is nearly a dead planet today.
Come on! Don't let go! -J.D.! - Rain! Where are the bodies?
Oh, God, help me. This is wonderful. Well, you know, you're very beautiful. And you're also very quiet. And I'm not used to girls being that quiet unless they're medicated.
Would have needed a spot to watch  <hon>her<hoff>from. Should we expect a ransom demand ? Kidnappers who want money contact the families to prove they have possession of the victim. They don't call to conceal it. Kidnappers.
I never even came into the room, Jeff. They did this.  <hon>Brooke and Polly<hoff>. All I did was show them who they really are, what they were truly capable of. People pretending to be decent.
Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental. Tell that to the clusters of  <hon>sarcoidosis<hoff>cases. Fire fighters and residents of pine tar forests? I did see these two putting out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.
That's why we all live in Shady Grove. 'Cause it's the only place we feel normal. But it was just a trip for  <hon>ice cream<hoff>. Soft serve. It comes out of the machine in a star shape, kind of like one of them Play-Doh machines.
All I want is to purify my heart, to relieve my feelings. Come to the church. I'll be there. Kissing your eyes. I wish there were a  <hon>herdsman<hoff>among us.
She could be on the team. I mean, you don't know that. No,I met her mother. She's not on the team. Wow. Okay,so  <hon>let's draw this out<hoff>.

When I got to the Crab Shack, I knew I was doing wrong 'cause I had that tingly feeling in my gut I used to get before breaking into a house. Hey. Hey ! I put in  <hon>ten bucks of<hoff> Skynyrd. I hope that's okay.
Great. Great, great, great. All right, thank you. Hey. I was just coming to see you.  <hon>Nypd<hoff>just arrested george lewis coming out of a bar.

The clay also helps to absorb the toxins found in many leaves that the elephants eat. There are other benefits to coming here. These clearings are the only places where the forest elephants can get together in such numbers. When they return to the forest, they will have to go their separate ways, once more. If large  <hon>animals<hoff>are rare in jungles then groups of large animals actually living together, are even rarer.
As winter approaches in Chile spring is arriving in the northern hemisphere. These are the deciduous forests of Homme. Dormant throughout the winter, they now undergo one of the most magical transformations in the natural world. By late spring the landscape is wrapped in a vibrant fresh green. Here, instead of conifers, there are  <hon>broad leaved trees<hoff> and that makes the character of this forest entirely different.

Okay, this is the jacket worn by our suspect, Hector Rivera. We believe that he stabbed Gabriel Cervantes, so I'm going to run what's called a luminol test. What's luminol ?  <hon>Luminol<hoff>is a compound that, when it interacts with the iron in hemoglobin, uh... Oh, you're there.
What do you mean? I mean, what a relief if we're no longer dealing with a homicidal maniac who's bent on shooting people at random, but rather a single act of passion. Of course, you don't know Kathy and Travis' last name. So it's not like we can track these people down, check this story out. Well, that's the thing-- when I saw them rehearsing to kill this man, the wife, Kathy, kept talking about this  <hon>card game<hoff>.
It would take 1,377,000 years for a normal cyanobacteria to releases as much hydrogen as one modified can in less than 20 minutes. So if that got out, into the environment, - there'd be no way to control it. - That's right. And with the wind to carry it, 1123-4 can go wherever and wherever it lands, it'll start to feed and grow continuously breaking down every water molecule it comes across, until the  <hon>planet<hoff>is one big cloud of hydrogen gas waiting to blow.
I really have to go now. Anybody here? This is crazy. I went the way you told me. But I couldn't get out of the forest. And it suddenly  <hon>got dark<hoff>.

Final offer. - Fine. Your ass and your grass is his now. - Shit. - Silas' phone. I borrowed some garden  <hon>shears<hoff>.
Storm's over! * Yesterday,he said my eyes... * Sometimes,it's not until a storm comes that things get unearthed. We get to see what's underneath.

Its shape makes it a slower swimmer... but it's great for catching fish. The little dolly soon comes across creatures that move... by pumping jets of water from their shells. They're called ammonites... and they thrive in the ancient sea. They have rock-hard armor and perhaps another defense.

Why'd you do that to her,dean? You wanted something and you took it,didn't you,dean? Didn't. Didn't do anything. What happens to kittens when they turn into cats?
Or is it something else? Is it the love of freedom? Cupcake! Wait a second! - Leave me alone, Daddy!
The view is so pretty from here. God sent me a truelove in my maturity... when fruit are either not picked or know the worm. God - or perhaps the Devil - sent me this mature love... and I thank the one and the other, as I have a truelove. Will I make it? Will I make it by this  <hon>traffic light<hoff>?
Gold would never be my medium of choice. It's far too malleable. What do you know about  <hon>alchemy<hoff>? Some say it was the first science. Practiced by intellectual leaders throughout history.

- It's a surprise. Everything will be revealed to you at the appropriate time. Mm..hm. Now, back to bed. You know, when Shelby was little.. Mom!
So you're gonna shoot him? Michael, he hit me, too. Remember when I scratched the car? It warms my heart a little to see the two of you showing some initiative. - Did you tell him? - Of course not.
It's foul, it's putrid, it's despicable as it intentionally tries to be, but true wretchedness is too unique to duplicate. The original stood the test of infamy. Why else would you have all come out here in the middle of the desert? Not to buy a shameless sequel, but to celebrate the most spectacular failure in video gaming history and stand on its unholy grounds. That's why we've all gathered here today.
What happened to like, "hey, let's just pretend we never had sex?" Yeah, I'm over that. Why are you even thinking about this again? I haven't stopped thinking about it. Oh, all right, well, see, I just said those things to hurt your feelings because you hurt mine, you know?
Keeping it lowercase. Keeping it casual. Really? ! Okay... come on.
You're right. There's other things people have done. - There's plots. - For money. - The plot of the movie Speed. - Yes, there you go. Put a bomb on a bus.
They're building something big out there. What's it doing out there? This thing is like any intelligence. It needs to grow. To advance.
- I'm not ta-- You need to gather yourself, man. Look, I don't know what is going on with you but you need to grab hold of the fourth letter in S.E.I.Z.E., which is the "I." - Is the "Z." - Which stands for "zebra."
Did you get your things done? Mrs Roach has Parkinson's. That's why she shakes like this. Samuel, you don't have to say everything that goes through your head. Oh, it's alright, love. He wanted to know so we talked about it.

He doesn't mean to make us criminals. He means to make us monsters. For that's the only way his God-fearing, taxpaying subjects can make sense of men who keep what is theirs and fear no one. When I say there's a war coming, I don't mean with the Scarborough. I don't mean with King George or England.
I can stall 'em for a few more minutes. And I am sorry. I'm sorry. For the short hauls. For the trouble I've caused.
She's the rare bird. She's the redheaded woodpecker, and I'm the common house sparrow. And that's what's worked for us for 20 years. I don't want to mess that up. You're afraid things will change because you're different?
Well, Hazel Grace, like so many before you... and listen, I say this with the utmost of affection... you used your wish moronically. Okay, we've been through this. I was 13. Hush! I am in the midst of a grand soliloquy, here.
Not to worry. OK. Let's go. Hello.  <hon>The train<hoff> to Istanbul circulates Is not it?
About 7,500 light-years away, in another part of our galaxy, there is a place of upheaval on an inconceivable scale. This is the Carina Nebula. A star-making machine. It takes a ray of light 50 years to cross it. The titanic stars born here sear the surrounding gas and dust with their fierce ultraviolet radiation.
What do you think it means? I don't know. Good evening. I understand you're holding a séance tonight. She's been waiting for the right moment, and now, she says, " <hon>The planets<hoff> are in alignment."
300 million years ago, all this was underwater, submerged in an inland sea. Well, I'm afraid I'm going to have to add to the erosion. There's your bighorn. Establishing a dominance hierarchy. It's weird. They don't usually go at it this late.
[EPIC MUSIC] [GUNSHOTS] That's the last of them. Good. Do we know anything yet?
This time we will not run. You know what they say. If you can't beat them, join them. I can clean my own wall. The outer wall is not your wall.
That's what makes the difference between an owl and an octopus. Unless you have an identical twin, there's no one else in the universe with the exact same DNA as you. Within other species, the genetic differences provide the raw material for natural selection. The environment selects which genes survive and multiply. When it comes to the genetic instructions for life's most basic functions-- say, digesting sugars-- we and other species are almost identical.
- No. - Thank you, gentlemen. The e-mail you sent, has anyone else seen it? Except for the agent that alerted me, no. Other  <hon>agencies<hoff>might have stumbled upon this.
Do you really think Cliff Barnes is gonna let bygones be bygones? He's gonna come after the Ewings for his own vengeance. And I'm gonna stop him any way I have to. Is that what you want, Elena, more bloodshed? That's not my problem.
And I'm gonna stop him any way I have to. Is that what you want, Elena, more bloodshed? That's not my problem. I understand you wanting justice for what J.R. did to your family, but the Barnes-Ewing feud is a whole other beast, and it doesn't involve you. You want to take that  <hon>dog<hoff>for a walk, fine.
But if my past work is any guide we stand a chance. Do everything you can. Come to me for anything you need. Thank you, Your Grace. You should know, the process may change him... somewhat.
Listen, I'm innocent. I didn't do it. Do what, biff, use an artifact to duplicate your frat brothers? Is that a candle in your pocket, or are you just really into twins? Tell me about the candle, Bryce.
Hey, big guy. Done for the day? Rest up, because first thing tomorrow, we're gonna find someplace great for you. Just until things settle down. Gruff, you see those stars over there?
On this intergalactic subway system, you could travel to the farthest reaches of spacetime, or you might arrive in someplace even more amazing. We might find ourselves in an altogether different universe. But how can a whole universe fit inside of a black hole, which is only a small part of our universe? It's another magic trick of spacetime. The phenomenal gravity of a black hole can warp the space of an entire universe inside it.
No... not at all. But look up, my boy, and see a sky full of them. The stars, Father? I do not follow. Every star is a sun as big, as bright as our own.
In the sun's core, the fusion of hydrogen into helium releases nuclear energy in the form of photons. These particles of light slowly work their way to the surface, where they're seen as sunlight. Helium is the ash of the sun's nuclear furnace. The sun is a medium-sized star. Its core is only a lukewarm ten million degrees... hot enough to fuse hydrogen, but too cold to fuse helium.
Bingo. This assembly line is the heart of the molecular industrial complex. At the molecular level, things happen too fast for us to see. So we'll have to slow them down about a billion times. Those larger molecules are carbon dioxide. Each one of them is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms.
It tells the story of that other world that once flourished right here. And this is the death mask of that 300 million-year-old tree. It was cast by minerals that replaced the original wood cell by cell-- in other words, a fossil. The tree surrendered its organic molecules to the environment long ago, its carbon and water. Only its shape remains.
The danger that the 2,000 largest cities on Earth would be reduced to rubble in the space of an afternoon is no longer one of them. The nuclear rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union had another by-product. The Apollo missions to the Moon were an extension of the arms race that raged between them. Sending people to orbit the Earth or go to the Moon requires big, reliable, powerful rockets-- precisely the same technology you need to carry a nuclear warhead halfway around the planet to destroy your enemy's largest cities. I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
- Are you funneling money to the Republicans? What on earth are you talking about? About 20 million in GOP Super PACs. You know I never make political contributions. That's the fastest way to upset my investors.
Make you some soup. Drive back to Wales. No, I mean, with your life. I'm a wife and mother, love. My life goes back to normal now.
You shouldn't have done anything without me. We didn't know where you were! We couldn't just wait. Not after everything that he went through! You know I love that ring.
I haven't seen you for two years. Well, you're here now. So, why don't we just enjoy this... Ridiculously unhealthy meal. You need more fat in your diet.
This frank revelation about your cult-- that's sparked quite a brouhaha in the media, and... Let me clarify that, Bill. We are not a cult. We-we don't proselytize. We have no agenda, we're not recruiting.
We have no agenda, we're not recruiting. Women who identify as witches are born as such, and their abilities-- which we call powers-- are part of who they are, part of their DNA, if you will. Oh, I see. So, in fact, you're saying that it's not a choice, being a witch. That's exactly what I'm saying.
It was nice. Yeah. Though the beginning was a little, uh... Your friends seemed nervous. Oh, they did?
Um, 'cause I need your advice on something. Um... The girls... Savi, Karen, April... do I tell them what I have planned? 'Cause Janet's got me freaking out, man, and I just want to make sure that, you know, Joss' key people show up. Yeah, well... I-I-I think if you really want it to be romantic, you know, um, effortless for her, do not tell them. [Chuckles]
I get the attraction. In summer. Well, it's a lot harder to catch trout when the water is really cold. That's another argument for summer, Will. But trout are supposed to be hunters. Like, they should be chewing on my hook here.
You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right.  <hon>The cops<hoff> can make it plenty tough for you.
You're breaking my heart. - Shut up. I can't say much for the women though. But, oh, the girls. All  <hon>Malayan females<hoff> should be poisoned at 21.
But, oh, the girls. All  <hon>Malayan females<hoff> should be poisoned at 21. Before that, they're... But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown? Oh yes, they're dark.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well,  <hon>the horses<hoff> look good.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our  <hon>girls<hoff> are all well-behaved.
Are you enjoying yourself this summer? Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement. Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. - Well, I'll try not to if you say so. - No.
Oh, I mean it, all right. I think you're off on the wrong tack, Regi. I wish I could show you how valueless money is. You can't. I know what  <hon>love<hoff> can get you into.
There are burglars singing in the cellar. Burglars singing in the cellar! Yeah, there's burglars singing in the cellar! Great big  <hon>fellows<hoff>, about eight feet tall... They sound like...
And here we have... Easy, easy. Easy. Just another foot. I thought you said another foot!
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing?  <hon>A knife<hoff>.
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked  <hon>thing<hoff> doing?
Jones! Go ahead, Jones. I'm waiting. Well, Mr. seaver, I... I bought a new  <hon>alarm clock<hoff> last week. It carried a five year guarantee.
That's impossible. Fact most definitely established... by comparison with those found on your cigarette case. - What about it, Whitely? - I can explain that, Inspector. I knew Barelli had sent  <hon>flowers<hoff> to the theater this afternoon.
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin. Miss Franchette, do you recognize these  <hon>men<hoff>? I most certainly do. Did you see them at any time between 5 and 9 p. M on October 26th in Strand? And, if so, where?
Yes, madame, sometimes I am dizzy with the beauty of my own thoughts. Perhaps the sun has something to do with it. This sun is nothing. Wait till you get beyond the mountains... and through the gates of the Sahara. There the  <hon>sun<hoff> blazes.
(A man sings a song of love) .... - I simply want to say how much I love you. I can't hide my desire, my burning desire. 'Cause that's true happiness, ...the joy that nothing can kill. Often  <hon>lovers<hoff> think that they should hide their true feelings.
And what did you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. They insisted on following me. - What do you think  <hon>bodyguards<hoff> are for?
I only just set up this business! Well it'll still be here when you get back. I mean, don't worry. It's just 'til this thing blows over. Would you mind tellin' me what this is all about?  <hon>Old "Pa" Clanton and his boys<hoff>are running the biggest rustling operation this territory's ever seen.
Steven be careful. You don't know what they might do. After all, we helped destroy the other four  <hon>dolls<hoff>. Perhaps we can edge past them. We can't get past them now!
We've been through too much! How on earth do we get out of this thing? I wonder if we'll ever see the sergeant and the cook again?  <hon>They<hoff> were rather funny, you know. Look, you still believe in these creations of the Toymaker, don't you?
MONOID THREE: Yes, One. What was the plan you had for destroying the Guardians and this spaceship? MONOID ONE: A short while after we leave, they will disappear in a cloud of fragmented pieces. You mean a bomb of some kind?  <hon>A fission device<hoff>.
So we must act. But how? And without bloodshed? Well, by guile, I say. They will come soon, so we must come the sooner. Aye, forestall  <hon>the villains<hoff> and leave them nothing, eh?
What about the radiation effects on Earth? That's a risk we'll have to take. But to use this bomb you'll have to get authority from Geneva. I'll get authority fella, right now. Get me Geneva. What is a Z-bomb? What is it?
The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night.
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing. For god's sakes, play something! Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all. He says... "The 2 women are standing "facing each other in dead silence.
I think I'm going to... - Sugar. Honey. Sabra. Outlaws.
All you need is carfare to Long Island. And get a shave and a shine. You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those blue-noses. Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night?
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success.  <hon>Dukes and ladies.<hoff> Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe  <hon>he'<hoff>s right.
It was the last word when the old gentleman built it. It's been like this for 75 years. I hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. I don't need to go into that.
We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was your car last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
- It was over... - Wait, let's see what we've got. "The witnesses were ushered into the death chamber. All eyes focused on the chair. The death-dealing device with which the state enacts the supreme penalty. The sound of footsteps is heard.

Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor? Yes, he'd be eligible. - I wish you all success. - Thank you. Have a good holiday. Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your old friends at Yarmouth.
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night?
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success. Dukes and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
Such a strange child, and so sensitive. Oh, well, I suppose we shall know soon. "Duquesnois," said the great Napoleon, "Maj. Duquesnois"... Crick! Crack!
Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.
- Want what, Bates? - The steak, sir. On my eye. On your eye, sir? My word, why do I always have to say things twice?
It was the last word when the old gentleman built it. It's been like this for 75 years. I hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. I don't need to go into that.

-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny.

There's not gonna be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down. I'll get Howard on the line. He'll know what to do. There's not enough time.
Most of you were very helpful and nice to me. I want to thank you for that. And I want to thank you for the horse ride you gave me and for Taylor's picture of me and my key. You might want to know, the key wasn't meant for me.  <hon>It<hoff> was meant for a Mr. William Black who maybe needed it even more than I did.
Train carrying an army of vampires? What chance do we have stopping something like that? I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line. You two get aboard and find Lucy. I'll start charging the bikes.
- Listen to what he's saying. - What's he saying? - He's saying you're being rude. - How am I being rude? - You know, you know. Come on. Look, sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun.
Who? Oh, I think you know who. Black hair, handsome features. Strange clothes covered in fresh blood. My, we've let this place go to hell, haven't we?
And like most alpha males, he couldn't care less about the young upstarts who would just love to take over his job someday. Yeah, yeah. Seen it all before. You need brains to make a living in this forest. The jungle toolbox can help, but only if you're bright enough to use it.
Hey, Eden. It's Paula. Are you still sick? You haven't shown up four days. Did you get those strange flowers we sent over?
Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor? Yes, he'd be eligible. - I wish you all success. - Thank you. Have a good holiday. Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your old  <hon>friends<hoff> at Yarmouth.
Go away. Jean? - It's me, Cissy. - Just go away, Cissy, please. I-I know you're upset, so I brought you some flowers and I picked them myself.
I got plans. Big plans! A vision of a world filled with Thneeds. It's going to be huge! Which way does a tree fall? Uh, down?
I told you what it is. Hey, I didn't get a chance to thank you for covering for me at the supermarket. Emily, there's no need to thank me. But, Emily, you are a beautiful girl, and you're also a smart girl.

You know what I mean? Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake. What a great word. Milkshake.
Can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved? And must I now begin to doubt Who never doubted all those years?
That's how we've maintained our balance. He has your old job, right? Maybe he got too inquisitive. Maybe. Let's wrap up this Yamamoto case fast.
Fly coach. America's financial system is intricate and complex. But behind all the technical terminology is a critical human factor. Confidence. Confidence in our financial systems is essential... to the smooth operation of our economy... and recently that confidence has been shaken.
She can't hear you. Don't you wanna have sex, like, ever again in your life? Yes. I just don't think that I'm the dating type. Girls only wanna sleep with me because they read my book in high school. So?
Our yeast. It's a special top-fermenting strain. Wait, wait. "Strain"? Yes. Yeast is alive.
Yes. Yeast is alive. If you feed it sugar, it can live forever. When my dad was alive, he would go to the garage to take care of it, called it his "baby." Ms. Harris, do you know why they called it "The Golden State Brew-Off"?
Dynasty: Look, everybody's gone home and I'm sure as hell ain't gonna do it. Just keep your mouth shut, Tariq. Ricky: Hmm... (Light clicks on and off) It's just the lighting is not, you know...

That's Hansel and Gretel. What sort of kidnapper leaves clues? The sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game. He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me... "All fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain."
You should get that. Let it burn. Please, don't! Ladies and gentlemen, how do you know when you have failed at a career? Is it when you're asked to host a showcase of no-name comedians, hoping to go to a foreign country, and you're being paid in drinks?
What was so wonderful about it? Just the enthusiasm, really. You know, it was as if the act itself was rejuvenating to her. It was as if she were dying of thirst and my cock was the fountain of everlasting youth. Mm, must be nice.
That's the Crooked Arrow, my Sunaquot name. I have made sticks and arrows for generations. Each one is different, and none are perfect. No arrow flies straight. There's nothing wrong with a crooked arrow.
The terrace that we see was originally bigger, and the building here didn't exist. It was built by the Club at the time of the sale, in 1903. Just behind was a direct access to the stables, which are still standing but unused at the present time. On the right-hand side, we also have the winter garden. For in the late 19th century, exotic plants were the fashion.
It seems we've finally stopped keeping secrets just in time for our wedding. You're not getting cold feet, are you? No. I've never been more sure of any decision my entire life. I know my I.D. is in here somewhere.
Follow the magic of his curse. Go to him now. Bring him to me. Gunnar. What was that creature?
'So... 'there's something in these photos that you didn't see, 'clever as you are. 'I've decided you're on my side. 'Everyone else might have given up on me, but I've still got, well... 'you.' What you missed was the bottle. First, it was in the baggage truck.
Bring him here. Unharmed. I would see him in this chair. Come on, higher! All right, ready, move!
I've been hiding behind your witchy friends. And in squalor, no less. Insulting a bunch of dead witches... Not smart. I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
Uh, I mean, uh -- Listen, I got something that smells like you boys. A body turned up in Canton, Ohio. Local P.D.'s trying to bury the story and the body. Okay, um, so, uh, what's up with the body?
Used to bring us presents when he came to visit and never had an unkind word to say to anybody. But at home, he had a temper. And that man started beating her. She'd lie, she'd make a joke out of it. She said she'd done this or that wrong.

I give her three days, tops. You are such a con artist. No, I'm a humanitarian. Really? A humanitarian posts for roommates, takes their money, and drives them crazy till they move out?
What did you feel at that house? The presence told me that your mother has done something ... Something that she didnt want anyone to know about. But this thinsg was trying to kill us wasnt it? No, it was trying to show us something.
So you went to the house. Yes. And I took my sword, like the voices told me, and it was like I was out of my body, like I was on the ceiling looking down. And I saw myself just stabbing her over and over. And there was so much blood.
Some kind of sniper. SWAT's searching everything at 750 yards. Area's on lockdown. Who's the ride-along? He's a famous comic book writer.

Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it! Quiet! Now, child, you were saying? Well, I'm running through the woods, and then right there in front of me is an arrow.
He knew when the storm was coming. But now the ancient weather patterns have changed. Our grandfathers fed their families well. My family has always depended on snow and ice. Nowadays when the ice melts, we can adjust but the polar bears are not so lucky.
Yeah, that's gotta be caribou paths. Look at that drainage coming in. Yeah, just over there... With the warm spring, the snowpack's melted early. And so the rivers are flooding and this is gonna be a problem for the caribou to get across. This is climate change slowing down the herd.
Hope that doesn't make me a four-star hump. You know, I started like you guys. Came out of the academy, thought I'd save the whole city, block by block. Be a real hero. Hmm.
Junior, we are a society of rules, OK? . What if everyone went around doing whatever they wanted, without any concern for what their actions would result in? . Yeah, Dad, I know. The judge gave me that whole speech when he issued that restraining order.
One more set of hatches. Then we are the next course. How about we give  <hon>it<hoff>a feast to remember? Us. Human bait. We could use the cage.
I slept. Stevie taught me how to sleep. I did it. It was a friggin' mistake, because I dreamt my door came back. I opened it and then this-- this thing rushed out.
Come on, man. I'm getting bad vibes. Let's get out of here. You're not going anywhere. Fucking Oslo prick. You owe me money.
No, those meds you're taking. Without anxiety to keep your vanity in check, you are vulnerable to a syndrome called hyper-narcissosis. Okay, look. This apple is your ego. Imagine it expanding to the point of critical mass, taking over your whole personality, making you an uncontrollable monster. Britta, how did an apple make that clear?
I never told you how much they were gettin' paid. - Shawn! - Hey, buzz. I forgot to pick up our check. Did I hear the Towne/beaumont case was wrapped up?
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty? In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it. For, in most comely truth, thou deservest it. To have no man come over me! Why, shall I always keep below stairs?
I'm sorry to interrupt. That man, Peter-he says he knows where Jones is going. I think he was looking for a mineral named Amphilicite. It's found mostly under sizeable deposits of limestone. I overlooked its significance.
Did you get it? - I got it. - Oh... Um... Listen, they wouldn't have recorded that, right?
- I got it. - Oh... Um... Listen, they wouldn't have recorded that, right? I had the mic on, but I don't think it was hot.
You're gonna need to come down and clean this up now. Ugh! I wouldn't have to do any of this if Alex would just let me use hers - from when she took the class. - Never. That design is my intellectual property.

Don't we need to find the last crystal first? Adam and Melissa uncloaked it. They did? But all we know is that it's somewhere in the high school. But Balcoin blood has a special connection to the crystals.
I've led my troops on a wave of assaults... to wake up my white brother. All of the niggers of the Earth will be killed... except for the few that helped with the fight against... their mud-soul brethren. Those few will be spared... and live their lives as slaves.

Whether a statistically minimal casualties may be warranted is a personal evaluation beyond the scope of the report. Each citizen must be its own assessment. There are those who cry out loud that there is absolutely no real threat to the free world and certainly nothing that can justify nuclear tests or nuclear weapons.

Look, our job was to solve a crime, and we did. That's a win. Christa thought she was doing the right thing. For the victims, for her company, for the people who'd be hurt in the future. And she killed a man. The law still frowns on that.
The white man destroys everybody. Well, it's mostly just Myk that I'm mad at. You know, I was in Ghana, and I was so sad and mopey, but there were these amazing African women who smelled really bad and didn't have clean water, and some of them even had AIDS.

My neighbors were looking for the small crocodile that had escaped from the lake that Aurora had built on her farm. I found the animal in my garden and spent part of that evening watching it move in the bathtub. Aurora was happy when she got the crocodile back. Since her husband was away on business, she ordered lemonade to be served outside, following the customary prudish etiquette. To make small talk, I asked about the animal's name.
Is today the day you meet surrogate candidates? So I'm told. I've narrowed it down to a couple of women who I think would be a good fit for her. Oh, no. It's like when a guy buys you a sweater for Christmas. It's Fluffy, tight, and low-cut.

- One of our greatest spiritual leaders. "The Book of G'Quan" is copied by hand from the original with every note and line precisely drawn. This ship and your ship are the same. I tried to warn the others that the ancient enemy was returning. But no one listened.

Truth is in our hearts, and none will tell you this but your father. Men hate the gods. The only reason we worship any of them is because we fear worse. What's worse? The Titans.
Men hate the gods. The only reason we worship any of them is because we fear worse. What's worse? The Titans. If they were ever to be set free it would be a darkness such as we have never seen before.

If we can regenerate his pathways with his own neuron cells we might be able to revive him. What about brain damage? There's been no oxygen to his brain for almost 40 minutes. But he's been in stasis for most of that time. That, combined with the strengthening of his cell membranes might buy us the time we need. We'll have to direct a burst of electrical energy into his cerebral cortex.

For some reason, I'm now convinced that it will. The promise from that day is probably her link to reality. Even now, in her dream, she's waiting for the Bella Ciela. I think both Hiroki and I sensed that somehow. The Bella Ciela is just a two-seater, and I can't pilot with this arm, so I'll stay behind and watch what happens to the Tower.

It's the worst kind of beating. There's a fiendish pleasure, though of watching, one by one, the people you started with... They get picked off, don't quite punch through right and they're goners.

Death's capture has kept you alive. And when I release her, you will die. That's not gonna happen! Just where I want'cha. I'm not that easy. I know I can't blow out your candle, Celesta. But I've noticed, when you're not holding it, it burns down very nicely.

We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was your car last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
- It was over... - Wait, let's see what we've got. "The witnesses were ushered into the death chamber. All eyes focused on the chair. The death-dealing device with which the state enacts the supreme penalty. The sound of footsteps is heard.
The end of Act 1 A DANGEROUS PROPOSAL Act 2 A few days later. Aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture. The next Saturday night.

Sir John, if you wouldn't mind coming down to see me after my act, I shall only be too pleased to talk over that little matter we were discussing. For god's sakes, play something! Fane says he has decided to colloborate in my play after all. He says... "The 2 women are standing "facing each other in dead silence.
Such a strange child, and so sensitive. Oh, well, I suppose we shall know soon. "Duquesnois," said the great Napoleon, "Maj. Duquesnois"... Crick! Crack!

A razor? What a vulgar person! Heavens! That fellow is taking a bath! What are you doing? Your Highness, there's something wrong with your tub.

Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.
Now look... such a country requires not only men, who are real men, but also women, who are real women. Not pampered little dolls from rich homes. Do you understand? -Yes! But don't you think your parents were so wise, to find you such a woman?

- What do you mean? Well, Gary changed the sketch to take the sting out of it and make it all pretty for you. I put in those cracks. He didn't know about it until he heard them. Why did you do a thing like that?
He's here. Find out what went wrong! If only he'd drunk what I wanted to put in the bottle. Look now upon our most puissant liege, Lord, Rudolph V undoubted king of this realm. If any man would deny our sovereign lord's title to our lands and fealty let him speak now, or be a tainted traitor.

And lots of paper too. Have you ever had so much to say you just couldn't say it? Try sitting down. Let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing?
I've never seen blood like that before. Polymorphocellular. Extreme hemachrosis. The alpha leukocytes apparently do not dissolve. The structure of the blood is quite different from that of a normal human being.
I don't hang around that Black Pussy Cafe for nothing. I met a poor fella who's in trouble. Something the matter with his grandmother's paisley shawl. He has 5,000 shares in the Beefsteak Mine, and you can buy them for a handful of hay. Hay?
Hey, wait a minute. - What, Johnny? - Gee, I got an idea. Look those guys outside, are they your pals? My closest. They've come in town to see my wedding.

- Well, isn't that what we came for? Yes, but think about it, poor thing. Why would I want to give that monster reason to bother the angel who wrote me such a nice letter? Then why did you tell her that it was an insulting letter? Because a school headmistress might forgive an insulting letter but she would never forgive a love letter. Girls, watch!
I'm sorry, Freya, but you understand. It's all right. They want you, strangely enough. Holl's bound to ask for you. Well, tell him peasants have no politics, they keep cows.
Dear, Martin... I am tired now. Yes, very, very tired. Oh, no, Freya. We met them on Karwendel pass.
Mother, it's hard to leave you here alone. I can manage. I still have my strength and health. You will find things in order when you come back, because you will come back. This is your home.
Good heavens, here I am making another speech. Well, I can think of no better wish than this: May our happiness last as long as we live. I think peace is better than war. A man's right to think as he believes is as good for him as food and drink. I thank you for your beautiful gift.

I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right. If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me. You talk about the people as though you owned them.
- Look, the feast has just begun. - Never did I see such fun. Did you see  <hon>the cook and weaver, Or their mother<hoff>, that deceiver? - I saw them in a corner there. - I never saw them anywhere.
I think I'm going to... - Sugar. Honey. Sabra. Outlaws.
I suppose you know what I'm thinking about. Possibly I have an idea. The union of two people for life... that is, marriage... shouldn't be taken lightly. How wise you are! Men are more careful in choosing a tailor than they are in choosing a wife.
Possibly I have an idea. The union of two people for life... that is, marriage... shouldn't be taken lightly. How wise you are! Men are more careful in choosing a tailor than they are in choosing a wife. That's probably why they look so funny.
- Very good, milady. Thank you. I'll probably talk like a cockeyed duchess the rest of my life. It won't even take six weeks. One day about two weeks from now, we'll be riding in the hills, past waterfalls and mountain greenery, up and down ravines and around through vine-covered trails... till we come to a spot where the scenery will be so gorgeous,
We'll take the loan from Leo's friend. I think he'll make a safer partner than our sister. How soon do you think you can borrow them? Right away, tonight. They're in the safe-deposit box...
All you need is carfare to Long Island. And get a shave and a shine. You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those blue-noses. Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
But there's no time for cleaning. First of all I'm going to assemble my wife. We can tidy up together and spare some time. It wasn't easy. It was first woman I've ever met. At first she looked quite ordinary.
We saw him from our window. He passed and lifted his hat. And my brother, to tease Mama, said Mama didn't like the Hubbards... and wouldn't invite them to the party because they kept a store. Then I saw Mama angry for the first time in my life. She said that wasn't the reason.
I wouldn't like to persuade Horace unless he gets a larger share. He's my husband. I must look after his interests. Where would this larger share be coming from? I don't know about things like this.
He's nothing! He's worth nothing! When I brought him in here, he was worth something... to talk! He didn't need his arms for that! That's the way I look at it, sir.
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
With our victory. I am very afraid. I can see something coming. You have to be very clever and very careful, my son. Always make sure the nations hate each other.
All you need is carfare to Long Island. And get a shave and a shine. You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those blue-noses.  <hon>Their ancestors<hoff>refused to come on  <hon>the M<hoff>ayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
That's the way I look at it, sir. More of these little slobs would be alive right now if they thought like me. I'm gonna kill these bastards. I'm gonna shoot 'em, I'm gonna bayonet 'em, I'm gonna break their arms so they don't give us no more trouble. That's what we're here for... to kill!
But if the English force us, we will beat them a second time! And God will be with us! I'll tell him just as you told me, Mr. Krüger. I wouldn't have turned him loose. I would have detained him.
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night?
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
Very shrewd move. You ever thought of making Margaret into a charitable institution? What a cracking wheeze! Yes, and then I could get a depreciation allowance on her. Exactly. I think the revenue boys would buy that one. Yes. You could probably get her  <hon>clothes<hoff> taken off as well.
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success. Dukes and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
What? Name was Vendonah, same thing as "rides down everything. " I see. Go on. Vendonah was unspeakable. He was so proud he wore iron shoes and walked over people's faces with them. So at last, the  <hon>tribe<hoff> decided that it wasn't a good enough excuse for him that he was young and inexperienced.
Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.
Those idiots. They were dragging, Dad. Real tough too. Yeah, but did you see that nutty girl sitting up on top?  <hon>They<hoff> were on both sides of the road.
Everybody's dying, and everybody is trying to forget it. It's the only way to go. Well, with the new owner coming what about Barney? Look, Barney's not gonna forget his little magic act. You put your bucks in the glove compartment and he'll turn them into pints. There's  <hon>some people<hoff> outside.
It was the last word when the old gentleman built it. It's been like this for 75 years. I hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. I don't need to go into that.
We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was your car last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
Are they badly hurt? The woman's quite shaken up and her son has a couple of bad cuts. They'll be okay. But the husband.... You know what he did with that ticket I gave him? He and his son played tic-tac-toe on the back of it.
That statue is the great Golem believed to have been destroyed centuries ago. If it is still in existence... If, I say. It is probably the most powerful force on Earth today. More powerful than the H-bomb?
- It was over... - Wait, let's see what we've got. " <hon>The witnesses<hoff> were ushered into the death chamber. All eyes focused on the chair. The death-dealing device with which the state enacts the supreme penalty. The sound of footsteps is heard.
- I'm a guy that lives in doorways. Those two  <hon>pathfinders<hoff>behind us, they live in doorways too. Well, let go of me, or I'll call them. Now, lady, that's one thing you just can't do. I'm not gonna hurt you and there isn't a thing I want from you, except keep walking.
Robert, look, that plane. It is not your American, if that's what you think. This one has come every morning now for a week. The fools don't even shoot at him because he doesn't drop bombs. If the Nazis only knew how dangerous he is to them.
And so, I must pronounce sentence upon you... for the crime of which you have been found guilty. - The sentence of this court is— - Milord.! May I beg the indulgence of this court? The court will listen with interest to anything... that Mr. Bartholomew Pratt has to say. But, Your Lordship, the jury has already made its findings.
That's not so good. How did the defense battalion make out, sir? Not bad, considering the strafing we got. You'll have to admit they did a pretty thorough job of it. With mathematical precision, square yard by square yard.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Single enemy plane approaching, sir. Reconnaissance, probably. I'm beginning to understand the major's idea now.
But he envied the dictators and thought that all governments of the people and by the people were soon to perish from the Earth. And as he changed, my love changed too. I remember the first day I looked at his face and trembled with fear at the change that I saw in that face. Hatred, arrogance, cruelty. The face of a man who no longer believed in God, but only in himself.
- Are? "... are-commended you bring your guitar, "as he enjoys Fado very much." Look, child, I've loosened my belt by three holes already. Yes, sir. If I didn't know Mr. Januário's handwriting, I'd say it was forged.
- Yes, sure. A bad way, but I can do it. That swine! What is the way, Inglés? - Get me your hand grenades.
I like... I don't know how to kiss or I would kiss you. Where do the noses go? Always I've wondered where the noses would go. They're not in the way, are they?
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man.  <hon>I'll draw your b <hon>lood.<hoff> Why does the doctor always<hoff> come at night?
Don't you see I've come back? I've thought of a way to explode the dynamite. So have I. The only reason I don't shoot you is because we need you. I've brought more men for the bridge, Inglés.
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success.  <hon>Duk <hon>es <ho<hoff>ff>  and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
Yeah. I wonder what that tastes like. Here's a new one. Matt, darling, we do want to take in all the brewery. I'm doing the best I can.  <hon>These young ladies<hoff> help promote my beer all over the world.
Now, that ought to be all right. Funny that they'd leave the door open. Anyone here? Suppose you tell us where you were when you shot Katherine, and where she and her husband were? There's nothing to worry about, Frank. Go on.
Not on my behalf, but in reference to my partner, Mr. Bialystock. Proceed. Your honor... Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Max Bialystock is the most selfish man I ever met in my life. Don't help me.
- I have given it careful thought. Miss Sara is better-looking. Don't you think so, joseph? Don't you think Miss Sara is better-looking than Miss Fanny? You call that good cleaning?
Hmm, he's gone again. I'll get him this time. Elementary, my dear Ms. Spedding. I replaced the gong. Don't move anyone. Sergeant, take care of that suitcase.
She's still breathing. Where's her father? What are you doing here? Dr Raynor, I demand to know what you are doing here. There's a  <hon>smoke<hoff>.
And "German boy, remember that you are a German." First, we have to fight our way back. But must you fight alone? Is it not possible for a woman to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to a man and share in the joys of victory? The struggle for power is a man's fight.
Yes, there is a chance. But it's a very slim chance. In the first place, the operation is a most delicate eye surgery. And in Dave's case, the injury is so extensive, it's doubtful whether large enough grafts of corneal tissue could be made successfully. You mean you can take the tissue from one set of eyes and graft it onto another? Yes, in the case of the cornea, you can.
Atmosphere count? Approximately 34% of the bodies of atmospherian types "H" to "M". All right, then. We'll do it the hard way. All sensors set for life-form registration.
And then, Andreas, I have other plans. Master. Well, you were successful? Yes, Master. There were two men in the boat when it landed on the beach.

She didn't live here. She just doesn't want us to. She's an ill-mannered little dog in the manger. All right, Bobby. We'll take you back to the inn... and let you order your dinner. Have you forgotten something?
I haven't wanted to harm anyone, Norman, only bring you the success you deserved. And you saw how it worked. The book, the prize, and they've practically decided on the sociology chairmanship for you. Did it ever dawn on you that perhaps I had earned my success? Oh, yes, yes.
Poetry is born at night. Well, can't history and poetry be born in the daytime, too? Well, don't stand there shouting at me, Sir Galahad. If you don't like it, why don't you do something about it? Well, I will!
The defense of the Aleutians and our Pacific Coast with the Hawaiis at the apex of the Triangle is almost impossible with what remains of our navy. But we are not considering a defensive campaign. You all realize I'm indulging in no false heroics when I say our only hope of evading destruction is to destroy the enemy. TheJapanese have won a quick and staggering succession of victories. They're aiming now at the final knockout-- the capture of Pearl Harbor.
On May the 8th, it will be detected near Ocean Island, as if heading for theJap fleet at Truk, but it will not attack. It will turn south, be seen on May the 1 5th at Guadalcanal. Every time one of our pilots encounters a Jap plane, he will return to the carrier, as if he did not stomach a fight. By sending this one carrier on such a mission, we hope to convince the enemy that our fleet is scattered, our fighting morale... shattered. Actually, we shall be waiting for them in force near Midway.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup. Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo. He's always sticking his nose into things. Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh? Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
Well, Sylvie? It's a beautiful night, hmm? Yes... it's a beautiful night. You sure don't need bedsheets for ghosts. But all the same, there are some things that can't be explained.
Not right now. No, I want... for you to perch yourself a moment at the window... Yes? The little fig tree in the garden... can you see it?
- Wait a minute. I'll answer your questions if you'll answer mine.  <hon>This old police box<hoff> was for a collector <hon>of curios. - It<hoff> belongs to me! - Why is it so important to you?
Tell me, has he found a nickname for you yet? Sometimes he calls me the gal with the hoe... to kid me about my gardening. He used to call me Patchouli. Look at me. I hate the little beast.
Goodbye.  <hon>Those  <hon><hoff>  fak<hoff>ing art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.

Why'd ya do it? Well, I figure, a long time dead. Live while ya can. That's what I say. When I think of the way  <hon>my folks<hoff> used to live.
My ad looks good, even if I did write it myself. I brought the check. Now, you're paying this today just to help me. No. See, I get my money's worth.
I'm not good enough for her, am I? Is there anything you've got to say before I drill you? - Yes, I'd like to ask you one question. - Go ahead. Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora
And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why a hand has five fingers?
- I will. That old- Still, she's right about  <hon>Doc Bull and the widow<hoff> Cardmaker. They've been the main topic of conversation in this town for the last five years. I don't see why two people can't be friends without everybody talking.
Are you quite sure? - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question. - Of course. How would you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000? Well, I don't think there is any question about it. It can only be attributable to human error.
Franz Propp wasn't with me in the basement. Did you come here to tell me that? No. I haven't got the gun. I didn't kill the watchman and I didn't take the money.
Still, dear friend, I'm here. I am gazetted to the 11th Hussars, you know that. My brother is to join the 11th Hussars, Capt. Nolan. I'm playing the spy in Mufti. I've not joined yet, so I took the opportunity of a spy's eye at them.

Well, I've never been... Spoken to that way before? Well, maybe it's about time. Good afternoon, madam. Mind the cable!
Hurry up, man ! Yes, sir. If I may be allowed to explain, sir. You have exactly 20 seconds. Yes. Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular  <hon>sweets<hoff> is their musical quality.

We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was  <hon>your car<hoff>last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
It's also because of the people. What meaning has life for them? What meaning has it for me? But I'm not like them! Pablo
You better go out through the window and don't forget to lay low. Keep in touch with Mac. What's the matter with that guy? He's right. The cops can make it plenty tough for you.

You're breaking my heart. - Shut up. I can't say much for the women though. But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
And you'll also be able to see old friends. - I know whatyou're driving at. - Yes? Yes. But there are also  <hon>decent people<hoff> amongst them. At least that's what they say.
But, oh, the girls. All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21. Before that, they're... But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown? Oh yes, they're dark.
I mean, is Willard the nearest  <hon>town<hoff>? I don't know. We were... Just trying to get to a motel before dark. You said those things turned your car over. You think we can get it back on its wheels and drive it?
Water, plenty of dates, this thing... - and not a soul around. - Yeah. And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going. I want to see the horses. Well, the horses look good.
Yes, we have some answers. But first let me stress the importance of seeking medical attention for anyone who's been injured in any way. We don't know yet what complications might result from such injuries. How bad has your kid been hurt? You go down there and tell... Judy? Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here and you stay with the kid, all right?
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
Afterwards, I had such trouble putting my hair up again! And then I forgot my gloves. I have something I must speak to you about. I've received  <hon>a letter<hoff> that I must show you. It was sent yesterday.
Secure him! Be seeing you. We have just witnessed two forms of revolt. The first, uncoordinated youth rebelling against nothing it can define. The second, a successful, secure member of the establishment turning upon and biting the hand that feeds him.
Oh, but now we can have the most wonderful dinners. My dear love, I was shocked at the butcher's bill. - Where is the account book? - Oh, it's about. Somewhere. Here's a recipe for turtle soup.
I was in town one day with nothing to do... and joined some fool committee or other... that was investigating labour conditions in a cigarette factory. I'd heard there were some pretty girls there. Now gentlemen, you've heard a lot of stories about our cigarette factory. They're not true. Our girls are all well-behaved.

Atamante was the son of Eolo, the wind god, lno had also been Eolo's wife. Anyway , it was all a matter of jealousy.

Ea welcomed Frisso and to give thanks to Zeus, sacrificed the golden ram.
Now, would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room... I undid the lantern cautiously, oh, so cautiously. I undid it just so much... that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. This I did for 7 long nights, every night at midnight.
It was this: My chin rested upon the floor of the prison... but my lips and the upper portion of my head... touched nothing. At the same time, my forehead seemed bathed... in a clammy vapor... and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus... arose to my nostrils. I had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit. Groping about the masonry just below the margin... I succeeded in dislodging  <hon>a small fragment<hoff>... and let it fall into the abyss.
Lost time, it's only money. But it's important. For you. I beg your pardon. It's important for  <hon>the men<hoff>, especially.

So you mean that she made up the message and everything. Don't <hon>put<hoff>her down for it, Keefe. She's just one of  <hon>the pack<hoff>. <hon>Fres<hoff>h out of high school, full of dreams... dreams turn into lies... lies turn into angles <hon>. First thi<hoff>ng these girls want when they roll into town... is to have somebody buy them dinner at Sardi's or Elaine's.
Worst posture since Quasimodo. How are your tits? We're gonna have to see them in this. It's so idiotic talking about it. What are  <hon>my parents<hoff>gonna say?
I think I'm going to... - Sugar. Honey. Sabra. Outlaws.
What's he put there? That looks like blood poisoning to me. We must make sure it doesn't go over the wrist. It has to be as hot as you can bear or we don't get  <hon>the bacteria<hoff>out. I read on a <hon>calendar<hoff> what bacteria get up to in the blood.
I've so looked forward to hearing music from you soon, Paul. The valves are not connected yet. I've brought you this. You must let  <hon>the chocolate<hoff>melt very slowly in your mouth. I always do, when I'm in bed.
At the Daisada, you won't eat so much. Aren't you eating ? You must try and understand the poor girl. She does not want to go there. Here I eat three times a day, when  <hon>my brothe <hon>rs <hoff<hoff>>  and sisters have got nothing to eat.
Lübeck. Germany. And now? Sightless in Brook Street. Not even Dr Sharp, great surgeon of Guy's and his hideous butchery, can bring back sight.
- Hi, girls. - Hi, Rose. Oh, Blanche, you remember a few days ago when I said  <hon>your car<hoff>was making a funny kind of a noise sometimes <hon>? - U<hoff>h-huh. - It's making it all the time now. It's nothing serious, I'm sure.

David! Hey, Sonny, talk about small worlds. You come to this closet too? - Hello. - Sonny, who are  <hon>these people<hoff>?
That's what we need. We find the guy who wasted this wimp and we are set. David, listen to me. Try and hear what I'm saying. I run  <hon>a business<hoff>.
And then... Oh, very clever, Mrs. Fletcher. You know, Inspector, I'm a little surprised that you didn't discover  <hon>these clues<hoff>. The first time I've been up here. You've beat me to them.
All you need is carfare to Long Island. And get a shave and a shine. You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those blue-noses. Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
I'll drive you back to Boston. On the way, I'll tell you the whole  <hon>story<hoff>about Martha Clay and Tom Cargill. Who exactly is Tom Cargill? The real killer in the Danbury Scalpel Murder. Well, Jessica, dare I ask if I'm going to see... your version of the Lambert case on the best seller list?
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night?
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success. Dukes and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.
It was the last word when the old gentleman built it. It's been like this for 75 years. I hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. I don't need to go into that.
We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was your car last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
- It was over... - Wait, let's see what we've got. "The witnesses were ushered into the death chamber. All eyes focused on the chair. The death-dealing device with which the state enacts the supreme penalty. The sound of footsteps is heard.
Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor? Yes, he'd be eligible. - I wish you all success. - Thank you. Have a good holiday. Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your old friends at Yarmouth.
Such a strange child, and so sensitive. Oh, well, I suppose we shall know soon. "Duquesnois," said the great Napoleon, "Maj. Duquesnois"... Crick! Crack!
- Want what, Bates? - The steak,  <hon>sir<hoff>. On my eye. On your eye, sir? My word, why do I always have to say things twice?
-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny.
The treacherous Helion troops have broken through our defenses! They have Ion-guns! Jennifer? Jennifer? It's so much smaller in real life, don't you think?
I thought she was a lesbian. She was. Jim, your ability with the ladies never ceases to amaze me. What can I say? I love women.
Don't buy the white couch until they start making white dirt. Yeah,that's a good one. Dads love that. Uh,you know,I have money. We're financially stable,Donnie and I.
What's in it? This and that. Womers things. I like to be prepared. Is that your car? Yes. Is it undercover?
- Cool. What do you think? - Sweet. But why does that chicken have ears? - Because Ludo can't sew?
Moira Syndrome was caused by a virus in the flower. But having hosted the virus for so long, the flower had developed a resistance. First we extracted the essence from the stems, and administered it to the patients. This effectively cured the Moira Syndrome. This was taught to us by the Serbian desert nomads.
Doctor Black Jack. You're also a Super-Human. I'm sure you can cure me. No mistake, it was a relapse. You can see the tumor here.
- I'm bored! - Not me. Do you want me to tell you that joke again? About the monkey. I didn't really get it. Well, you have to know what stock options are.

Well, if you don't open up... your whole evaluation is gonna have to be solely based on your actions. - I'll take what I deserve. - What you think you deserve. I might have a different opinion.

You don't know what kind of doctor I am, do you? A hero doctor, through and through. A physicist. And this goes beyond medicine. Batman's cells are mutating.
Unfortunately, the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor fathers cannot share in this sentiment. A female child born to a poor family may find herself in compromising situations in the name of survival. The father of a dynasty would need a son to carry on the family name. It was long believed that a child's gender was determined by its mother. King Henry Vlll believed it.
That's why I let go Of your mother's neck And showed her mercy She up and ran away A year ago today Her letter came today Her letter came today
Well, thank you. Why didn't you offer him the painting right there and then? I sold it twelve months ago. Before I joined the Brotherhood and people still bought my work. So sell it again!
Do I look French? Do I have on a black skirt with a white apron? CHRIS: That's a whole other type of maid. You're a fool. Mothers do have limits.

Jaya and Dhara did not want to be so famous, I suppose. Shame, too, because they could have made a lot of money for all of us. Were they ashamed when people at home found out what they were doing? They came in screaming bloody hell at me. Their brother had called from Calcutta to say that he had seen them naked on the videos.
Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor? Yes, he'd be eligible. - I wish you all success. - Thank you. Have a good holiday. Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your old friends at Yarmouth.

Emma Sandbrook. I own the shop. Er...yes, no, er... Frank. We spoke last week.
And, once you got it, he asked you to steal for him? He offered me 10 grand to get some passport stamps and some headed stationery. You didn't ask what he wanted them for? He's not a man you ask. He's the man who tells you. When did you last see Kilic?
- That's right. I haven't been through my mail, but I think I saw my assistant with it this morning. It should be at Gretchen's desk. The mail's here. Not the perfume?
Such a strange child, and so sensitive. Oh, well, I suppose we shall know soon. "Duquesnois," said the great Napoleon, "Maj. Duquesnois"... Crick! Crack!

So,she puts it on,wears it for about an hour, and she nearly died. Did she explode? No. Nice. Yeah,everything closes up, and you end up asphyxiating,but even a small amount is enough to damage you for life.
Nerve agent would never be a civilian doctor's first diagnosis. Well,I don't know of any nerve agent that makes a patient explode. Technically,it was a fireball,not an explosion. But you're right. Five new cases,including the exploding woman. They all live in different parts of town, and they all work in different parts of town. They all dropped in different parts of town.
J.D., you're in the relationship, you have to care! - Sorry. - Thank you. Look, you know what I love about where we are now? It's like I can tell you...
You know, I don't even think it's the mushrooms that are the problem. - It's not? - No, it's, um... The tomatoes. What's wrong with the tomatoes?
Option B, you work off the debt. I could always use a couple of good leg breakers. Then, of course, there's the unpleasant option C. That would be the aforementioned chalk outline? If there's enough of you left to chalk.
This is Agent Wilson Wright. We're with the Bureau. - We'd like to ask you a few questions. - About what? Well, let's start with where we can find Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield. Be ready to pick us up.
The doctor said... - I'm fine. I'm better than fine. Husband. Hey, everybody. First, I just wanted to say congratulations to Lucas and Peyton.
-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Walter, why me? Why am I seeing these visions? I don't know. Walter, what about William Bell's drug trials? Cortexiphan?
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny.
I have also offended my Prince, for which I ask him hearty amnesty. I heartily desire you to pray for the King's Grace and that he may long live with you in health and prosperity. and that after him his son, Prince Edward, may long reign over you. There it is. Nonsuch Palace.
Come here! I won't let you do this... What are you saying? You can't do this Do you know how important this day is?
Erm...well, the museum's closed now. But I hope you all had a great day. Thank you. Marion... Whatever you want, the answer's no. That jacket is gorgeous.
You OK? Please, you've got to come quickly. What is it? There's this thing, a big shining light. This creature came through and it started... How much tranquilliser do you think we need?
This place is airtight! Can it get through? - Ed? Can it get through? - I don't know!
I am the doctor. Ultimately, this is my responsibility. But listen, we should be focused on these women and... And not pointing fingers. I cannot imagine what it feels like. Hard enough to carry your own. Imagine carrying somebody else's.
Let me think. Not a thing. Nope. - No. There is something I would like to say. - Excellent. We're all ears. Do we think the ladies have gone too far with the sex-positive feminism?
not today. — jesus, morgan, middle of the day, you're out again? — yeah, i have some secondary analysis to do on the kyle butler case. — there's a spatter report on christine hill's suicide sitting on your desk- you even look at it? — i don't need to. it's a cut-and-dry suicide. — yeah, but you have to sign off on it.
He was downstairs. I don't know who he was,And yet my vision-- I had all these intense... feelings for him. I... hey,honey. I don't understand,mark. I would never cheat on you. I wouldn't betray you. I wouldn't--I...
Never do that. I heard about your hot-tub mishap. Nice. Mishap? Mishap? It was a disaster, Henry!
I'm mad at you. I read your papers last night, and they were amazing. You really opened up and let me in. Felix, I could taste the salt water from that first wave you rode. Samgui, my cheeks burned with the humiliation of that spelling bee defeat.
Your people have a much affectionate memory of this period of history than my people do. What are you talking about? We saw Posse together in theaters. I want to go home. Here's how it's gonna go.
She's being set up. How can you still believe that? You've seen the video. I don't care about the video. I don't care what anyone says, telepathic or otherwise.

Lauren, we wanted... Save it. You'll be out of our lives In ten minutes. Just like all the rest of them. I spend every waking minute Thinking of ways we can be together. You're getting very creative.
How serious is this? It's serious. Some cases are more severe than others, but this disease is the leading cause of blindness in adults, kidney failure, amputations. That's the scary part. The good part is that it's manageable.
Yves Moehringer will be arrested at once and fully prosecuted. - And the girls? - We will repatriate them. - First class? - Indeed.
I've isolated a suspect enzyme from Tess' blood, but I still haven't been able to find a match. Anything new from the DCA? No, just they think the virus is airborne and might have been deliberately released by someone. As you can see, I created a model of the virus path. Dr. Coats said the virus induces sleep
They are after all built to survive a Yellowstone winter. But this tiny hummingbird is more vulnerable. Flowers damaged by snow will die and the nectar the hummingbird needs goes with them. Hummingbirds must be resourceful to survive. Bark wells dug by a sapsucker a type of woodpecker quickly fill with sugar-rich sap as soon as the warm weather returns.

The captain's made sure I can get away... before the Psi Cops get here, but... I had to see you again, before my ship leaves. I never told them. I never told anyone. I hid it all away in the smallest, tiniest corner of my mind.
There's no forced entry, no signs of a struggle. Walter do you have any thoughts? Reminds me of Christmas. Like a fire log that burns so hot it remains intact, holding the shape of its former self. You used to love that when you were a child.
- You got me. I'll tell you something. He'd get a kick out of what I'm about to do. Don't do it, Doug. Big mistake. Well, you know what my father always said?
No, I didn't. Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of shortcuts is most impressive. This is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village. Then you're gonna see a magic show.

"There's a room. A small boy enters with a candle. " What is this, a bedtime story? It's a Sufi parable. The man in the room, referring to the candle, asks, "Tell me where this light comes from. " And the boy blows out the candle and replies,
Let's look at it together... No. Don't touch me. Where is my leg? Excuse me? My leg.
I'm sorry Chief, but there is a point when the human body...gives up. Maybe my doctor wasn't... Bashir to lnfirmary. I need a nurse and a med-kit immediately. We were able to localise the transporter beam and trace it back to this location. These quarters have been vacant for weeks.
Can you believe that? I'm pulled into the future and he thinks about... Chief! Oh, am I glad to see you. - What the hell happened to me? - lt was the radiation.
Not very often, no. Why did you hire me? Uh... Corporate gives me A certain amount of money for staffing. Uh, and you know the way That corporate budgets work.
Hard as it may be for you to imagine, B'Elanna, my people were once handsome and vigorous like yours. And with your help, we will be again. Perhaps, when that time comes... I will not disgust you quite so much as I do now. They're coming to take us to the work detail. You can't let them see how sick you are.
The guard won't be back right away. Keep it. Tom... I've been thinking. When they did this thing to me, I think it changed more than just the way I look. What do you mean?
I'm looking for my friend, Tom Paris-- a human male. Have you seen him? He was here, but they sent him to another tunnel. Which one? Back that way.
The rules we're hearing may not be the rules he's setting. Two years ago, I would have been out on the street, screaming through a bullhorn, probably arranging for someone in the kitchen to tamper with the hors d'oeuvres. I believed that being prosperous meant you couldn't appreciate the problems of the less prosperous. That compassion couldn't exist without suffering. I was wrong.
- Can we get there today? We need to get there today. We have to feed the goats. The route will be easy at first, and then we'll reach bigger dunes. The Atchi and Atchido dunes, that run into each other.
The animals are tired. - Yes, they are. Even my donkey is tired. - Tired or sick? I guess it's ill. Your donkey's ill?

England, France, parts of Kentucky, a small piece of land in Ireland known as Worchester. They bayou. And from the darkest corners of the earth, cult worshipped their master, waiting for the day the stars would again align, and they could release Cthulhu from his tomb beneath the sea to once again rule in his dominion over man. It's pretty much we're talking about... In part, but it fails to mention the relic, an ancient key made into parts, split and lost centuries ago.
No rush. Mr. Fileman, I didn't expect to see you here. Katie said she was going to see you and suggested I come along. Did you bring the list of people who had access to the house? Yes, I did. - Right. What's he doing here?
Level One. Episode 9 Moment and Heart Together The recent battle severely damaged the intercept system of New Tokyo-3. We've only effected 26 percent of the repairs at present. And our operational capability for actual combat is virtually nil.
We? What do you mean by this "we" shit, Ingrid? You know as well as I do that that was your fuck-up, not mine. Oh, my arm. Juliet. If you keep forgetting to turn this off, you're gonna burn down the whole house.
The colonel... Col. O'Neil. You men, you prisoners I want to talk to you about your situation here. It must be clear to you by now that your government has cruelly abandoned you. As you know, they have turned down all of our efforts to exchange you. They know of your suffering which though terrible, is no worse than the suffering of our men in Northern prisons.
Okay, I see a man of great intelligence dedication, cute little kind of insecurity. - Little paranoia-- -This went to shit fast. Zane, why do we always have to analyze everything? Can't you trust that I love you? Algorithms I trust. Boolean logic I trust.
Is that what you think? I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking... how much trust it takes two people to do something like this. For me, stealing has always been a lot like sex. Two people who want the same thing.
Why did you move all the furniture around? Let me guess. That was Violet's idea too. Yeah, uh, actually... she was nervous about Gino comin'... and wanted everything to look perfect and... You know women, Mick. Sure, Caes.
The choppers are waiting! Get the fuck outta here! She fired at you? Near us, yeah. Then why did you lie to the investigators about how she performed?
- Hi. - What's wrong? Oh, darling, what's wrong? I know I don't know you very well... but I just didn't know where else to go. It's those girls that I always come in here with. They're trying to use magic against me. You don't understand. They killed people. I tried to do a binding, and it didn't work.
Got 'em all categorised, people. Bin A, these are people's needs. Things, someone, food, love, a break. Bin B, places and what they need... "Dear God, my sister and I are nurses at a retirement home. "

The door's open. You can go out there and put a stop to everything and it'll be over. Or we can go upstairs and change medicine forever. It's your call. Maybe you're right. Those men upstairs, maybe there isn't much point to their lives.
But this could work. According to the books they learn the landscape by following their parents. In the spring, they come back by the same route exactly, to the same place. Right there on the front porch. Our problem is that your birds don't have anybody to show them the way.
No. Just a few words... Left over from school. - The cigarette. - Please take one.
If anyone's interested, we've been here exactly 24 hours. The guys outside seem tired, too. They're waiting for us to get nervous and head out. That's what I'd do, if I were up there. First, I'd let'em get thirsty.
What a damned life. Watch the birdie! -Wait. One, two, three, four... Samir, I'll scalp you like a Sitting Bull!
They got the inner circle. They've intimidated all the dukes and earls. So now all that's left is winning the people. Every time there's an election in this country, whether for mayor president or city council the fact is people are tired of the way it's been and want a change. How now, how now, what say the citizens? Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, the citizens are mum.

Our refusal to bow to any order but our own! Any institution but our own! Our friends in the Royal Irish Constabulary want to shut me up. Jail me again, shoot me, who knows? But I'd like you to send them a message!

Not you. Sure. I'll testify. Well, you know what people think. Think this great city runs itself.
You either... You either run for office, or you end up a judge. Why become an umpire when you can play ball? ...continue to pour into the area around Saint Michael's and the Archbishop's mansion. Over here! He's over here!
For fun. There must be carp here. And the women of the court? Do they powder their entire body? Many are married to old monkeys but few can swim.
Your destination: a non-extradition treaty country. You will each be paid a fee of $ 1 million for services rendered. But you can never again set foot on your native soil. - Can you live with that? - Yes, sir! The men of Marine Force Recon... are selected to carry out illegal operations throughout the world.
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere... will kill every living organism in an eight-block radius. Get the point? Uh, what did Hummel mean by your countermeasure, General? Standard poison is countered by napalm. It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation. Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas is... that it's designed specifically to withstand napalm. That's where, uh, thermite plasma comes in. General Peterson?
Head out, and I was the result. Well, I'd like to think it would've led somewhere if only- Six federal marshals hadn't kicked down our door... and dragged you back to prison? - I'm sorry. - It's all right.
- And what was yours? - That dreamers often lie. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. O! Then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Whatever, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? Everybody says this is the place to come for jobs. Who is everybody? People from the neighborhood.
Ketchup! I took it from him and ran! I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair. The vendor gave chase, a wooden- handled, pronged fork in one hand. You gonna give me two?
You can do it. Come on, let's go. Be strong. I will. The Wilkinson Home for Boys held 780 youthful offenders housed in 5 separate units.
Did they say anything to you? No, they just looked at me and walked out of McHale's. Are you sure the two defendants killed Sean Nokes? I know they killed him. If the plan worked, it would be everyone's success.
microchip Z-ray lenses, capable of penetrating a layer of clothing. You'll be able to see if an enemy is carrying a weapon. Oh. Director? Oh, now, Steele... should you find your hands bound, what you can do is just reach down and pull this pin with your teeth.
They came to me... I was surrounded by these creatures... by an indefatigable workforce. They were starving. Within a few seconds, they'd eaten a communist newspaper... and 'Le Monde Diplomatique'. They started drinking...
He counterfeits well. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. they have laid me here in hideous darkness. ... - Sayest thou that house is dark? - As Hell, Master Topas.
Like for you to be out there chasing tornados? It's a thrill. Man vs. nature. Battling the elements. What a weasel. As a scientist, can you actually predict tornados now?
I have a lot of things to do in the Black neighbourhoods, we have a lot of problems we have to solve among ourselves. Prostitution, dope, gang fights. Knowledge of self. Black people have no knowledge of themselves. We have been made just like white people mentally. White people have made us so much like them it's hard to teach them about themselves, it's hard to teach them to unite and marry and be with their own.
The brother said something there! Don King put this together. It was not a colour put it together, you understand? I'd like to call him the Messiah. 'This fight came into existence 'because of Don King's desire to break out of the pack.

Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny.
She will never see us now. Randalls is such a distance. It's barely half a mile, Father. Depend upon it, we shall see Mrs. Weston nearly every day. Well, I take it very ill when people get married and go away.
I have been thinking of it for some little time. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley. She's always so attentive to them! I must go. I do not like it Emma, when people go away.
And you and I shall dance at it. And there's the Bates house. You see, I am getting to be quite at home in Highbury already. Did you pay your visit yesterday? Yes... Oh, yes! , I was just going to mention it.
Just who are these "Money Changers" James Madison spoke of? The Bible tells us that two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ drove the Money Changers from the Temple. It was the only times Jesus used force during his ministry. What were Money Changers doing in the Temple?
When all was in readiness, in April of 1929, Paul Warburg, the father of the Fed, sent out a secret advisory warning his friends that a collapse and nationwide depression was certain. In August of 1929, the Fed began to tighten money. It is not a coincidence that the biographies of all the Wall Street giants of that era, John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Bernard Beruch etc. all marvelled that they got out of the stock market just before the crash and put all their assets in cash or gold. On October 24th, 1929, the big NY bankers called in their 24-hour broker call loans.
To be sure they circulated widely, they were declared to be "good for the payment of taxes". Of course this idea was nothing new. It was exactly what America had done before the American Revolution and there are many other examples throughout the world. But it was new to Guernsey, and it worked miracles. This market is still in use, and remember, it was built for no debt to the people of this island state. But what if we follow Guernsey's example? How would the bankers react to these reforms?
Franklin was a big supporter of the colonies printing their own paper money. In 1757, Franklin was sent to London. He ended up staying for the next 18 years, nearly until the start of the American Revolution. During this period, the American colonies began to issue their own money. Called Colonial Scrip, the endeavour was very successful.
She did not mention you by name, but that was implicit. If I tell others in the chain of command then Sheridan will find out. I will have broken the promise. But if I break it by telling you, since you are not in the chain he may not find out and I will not have broken the promise. I'm in awe, Lennier.
So you're saying the Minbari... - That you stole Babylon 4. - Not quite. Before coming to you, I received two additional records from Draal. Remember, the Great Machine on Epsilon 3 has been there for over 500 years.
Lisa, that's not at all like you. - Exactly. - Hmm. I forgot my swimsuit, too, but I improvised. Uh, Mom, I'm kind of trying to go for a different look this year. How about this adorable sunsuit?
Just wait till he sees his tip. Brown, our treasurer, let's have some of those small pieces of silver you won in the last casino. Thank God for the Professor's watch. We would've been washing dishes for a week. I tell you, I just love the French women.
It's got to be her call. We're the only friends- the only family she's got. We have to do something. Not until she asks. My childhood room.
-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course.  <hon>People<hoff> here are funny.
They look not up, but down, or to the center. Additionally seen wearing glasses over glasses go out of focus. Hence, the offers are at hand height. We hope the client relaxes ... and abandons the plan to buy only one product ... and he does more purchases through the offers on the upper floor. I hope I have put forward convincing solutions ... upwards in order to lure the customer.
The Axeman killed eight people, scared the crap out of the city, never got caught. Listen to this. "If women will not dance "to the sound of my axe, I shall gladly make them dance with the other." Do you know a saxophone is called an axe?
Hmph. Their power is built on the sweat of our backs. The only reason you and I in this country is 'cause our great-great- <hon>grandpas<hoff> couldn't run fast enough. We'll never be welcome here. And those witches are the worst. They're not so bad.

Uh-oh. Charlotte's headed for a fall. I did it. I made a perfect cappuccino. 75% of my body is burned, but I did it.
Unless they attach it to one of these. This is not good. How not good is "not good"? Very, very not good. It looks like Hayes used the intel Gary Leonida gave him to gain control of a U.S. Predator drone over Afghanistan.
No, no, no, no. Something is going on here. The reason why she got this room... She didn't want anybody to know about it. The safe is locked.
Yeah, I wrote one. "Eat my shorts, Jabronies. Knope, out." I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time. But we should focus on the haunted house.
Galaxies are drifting through space, which allows for exceptional compositions. For example, this pair of galaxies known as Arp 273. Scientists assume that the smaller galaxy has fully passed through the bigger one, and as a result, created a form that reminds us of a rose. In a couple billion years, our own galaxy may collide with our neighbour, Andromeda. Something similar has happened with the Antennae galaxies.
I think I'm going to... - Sugar. Honey. Sabra. Outlaws.
All you need is carfare to Long Island. And get a shave and a shine. You're gonna have a tough time getting in there as it is. I know those  <hon>blue-noses<hoff>. Their ancestors refused to come on the Mayflower. They didn't want to rub elbows with tourists.
And what about Muriel? I'll give her up. I'll go to her tomorrow. Set her free. Oh, God... this I did not intend.
It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night?
-Good night. Well, my evening's a social success. Dukes and ladies. Don't tell me the king of Spain is going to jump out of a pie. You mustn't be snobbish.
Goodbye. Those faking art dealers! Peanut brains! Parasites! Maybe he's right.
It was the last word when the old gentleman built it. It's been like this for 75 years. I hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. I don't need to go into that.
Well, it turns out that bonito wasn't served at the party. So how'd it get there? It was already in the ice. How does that work? Well, I ran the truck manifest.
Must be good. Excuse me, you can't eat here. You're not homeless. How'd you know? You're wearing a wedding ring, which means you haven't sold it for drugs. Your eyebrows are well-groomed, suggesting a recent visit to the salon.
So, you think I've lost my mind? I think certain people never know when to give up. You're probably right. I can be stubborn. But not on this one.
We're tired of your goings-on in this town. It's a shame and a scandal in the community. Where was your car last night? Now wait a minute. What are you laughing about?
- It was over... - Wait, let's see what we've got. "The witnesses were ushered into the death chamber. All eyes focused on the chair. The death-dealing device with which the state enacts the supreme penalty. The sound of footsteps is heard.
- We find it, contain it... - That's Dr. Fassbach. Virologist from Harvard. The analogy I keep coming back to is Spanish Flu. Spanish Flu?
Are you allowed to do that with anyone else? Am I allowed? Your mother, before she left that's all she would talk about, was me finding somebody else. But I would tell her I can't because she's my one and only. What did Mommy say?
Human father. Lizzie, you surprise me. Help yourself to the blood cakes, little one. They give you strength. Soon the blood moon will be full.
Drawings or a set of notes. Something. Just because something is yet to be found, does not mean it doesn't exist. But if Frankenstein was real, if he really did animate a human, would it help you to study it? Well, yes, absolutely.
You ever been to Southeast Asia, Damien? No, I never been there. He's found the stash. Hey, prep me 20 key, it's a rush. South East Asia planted this drug by the side of the road which is why the dope there is worth shit.
A cold blooded setup. Your full of shit. Now get down on your knees. - Get down on your knees! - Damien. - There's a problem. - What? The number didn't come through?
They come from the countryside like I do. My sisters and mother are still there. Look at them, they're like a happy little island in a sea of grim businessmen. Makes you wonder. Hey, listen. Your mother and your sisters, we could pay them a visit, you know on our trip.
Really? And why would I do such a thing? You rescued me from the building. We were alone almost a minute. If that thing was in me...
There must be a mistake. There's no mistake. Tell them right now to leave me alone or I swear I'll kill you. Tell them now! Tell me what?
Oh, all right. Do you know that feeling you get in your gut when something just ain't right? Uh, yes, I know the feeling, sir. When I was about eight or nine, I was walking barefoot on the back porch. I heard a rattling sound, like a kid's toy, you know?
Would it be too much to hope that Mr. Micawber would eventually be eligible for a judge or a chancellor? Yes, he'd be eligible. - I wish you all success. - Thank you. Have a good holiday. Enjoy London, and have a good time with all your <hon>old friends<hoff> at Yarmouth.
The gift is the playlist, not the iPad. When I update my music library, it syncs to their iPads. I use an app called Frankensync to sync the playlists. I upgraded to this new app, Bride of Frankensync, and now, apparently, it syncs all of my shit to everywhere 'cause it's a very powerful app! How do you forget to erase your sex tape?

- Is it already being taught? No. No. No, I was precocious. So... you theorized a machine that could solve any problem.
Such a strange child, and so sensitive. Oh, well, I suppose we shall know soon. "Duquesnois," said the great Napoleon, "Maj. Duquesnois"... Crick! Crack!
My heart's beating so fast right now. Almost got us killed, like, three times already. Yeah, but it was worth it, dude. Incredible. All right, so... I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
- Want what,  <hon>Bates<hoff>? - The steak, sir. On my eye. On your eye, sir? My word, why do I always have to say things twice?
Jack, sometimes you disappoint the hell out of me. You got emotionally involved with a whore? Yeah. She's not a whore. All women are whores.
-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course.  <hon>People<hoff> here are funny.
Dodo! Well it's quite alright Steven, don't mind me! Just have a good time with your new friends! Well now, perhaps we can get a little action around here? Okay Mr, make with the piana'! Make with the piana'..!
If that navigation chart's anything to go by, I'd say that they're almost there. DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right. Then where are the Guardians? Well, at least the <hon>descendants<hoff> of those we knew before. Surely they should be here, guiding the ship? I don't think that will be necessary, dear boy.
What do you mean? Are you up to something? (HESITANTLY) Uh, no. No? But you gave yourself away, didn't you? I've got a feeling when the time comes you're not going to bring the  <hon>Guardians<hoff> down here at all, is that it?
A fission  <hon>device.<hoff> I had it made secretly and it is ready to be detonated at any time. But where is it? Excellent, One. MONOID ONE: The last place they would think of looking.
War-Machines must be built immediately! Further instructions from WOTAN. We shall require skilled labour; a labour corps will come into operation immediately! Contact will be made by these people by telephone.
We're going to make it disappear just a little bit sooner, that's all. But don't you see, general? A nuclear explosion on Mondas would deliver a terrific blast of radiation, enough to destroy all the life on the side of the earth facing it. It might even turn into a sun, a sort of supernova, and it would certainly destroy the space capsule. That's a risk we'll have to take.
- If we could prove to him it's safe ... - That also crossed it. Take the official car. Follow the same route that Melford's going to take. Walk through that door ourselves. And watch out for flying chandeliers. In Melford's dream the next thing that happens is ... - A  <hon>handle<hoff>comes off in his hand. - Hm.
Perhaps one day... they will be understood. It all began with the death of Nathaniel. He was no less of a son to me. She may have bore him, but I raised him. I provided when she could not. We were coming home across the causeway. The horse somehow lost its footing. The carriage was thrown into the marsh.
It is simply... Didn't I tell you this morning  <hon>that heads<hoff>would roll? Yes, indeed, you did, dear. But, you know, it's an extraor <hon>dinary<hoff> thing. Heads do not roll as they used to.
# That I tremble when  <hon>they<hoff>charge # # Now, certain words like "big" and "small" # # Mean what? # Would you please tell  <hon>me? # #<hoff>To me all cats are 10 feet tall #
I offer you one. It is complicated. You can not dress alone. You ashamed? No.
Colonial intelligence. Naval, more specifically. One of their top agents in the Americas. Responsible for the security of one particular ship. A ship with a cargo so rich, the king of Spain is very anxious to see it launched.
- I got everything well in hand. - Good. - The Golden Nugget will be fine. - Thank you so much. Oh, look at that. A cat.
Becker, want to dance? -l'm not a very good dancer. -That's OK. You know, Becker... the best thing for jet lag is dancing. Well, I'm long over my jet lag. I'll tell you something.
- It's about her. - Is this your daughter?  <hon>Some people<hoff> are using her to force me to do a job. - If I don't ge <hon>t to her<hoff> soon, they'll kill her. - Did you do the job?
- Hello, Heinlein. - Hello. Hello. I would like... ... cheese. - There you go. See, I put  <hon>these sentences<hoff> into his voice synthesizer.
Do you really? Don't touch me! You're so clueless. You don't even know me! My mother and sister killed themselves.
- Wolfgang! - What? Your color is not good. You should not be making experiments so late. Oh, by the way, I found  <hon>the bug bomb.<hoff>
And what has it accomplished? Mr Truman drops atomic bombs on women and children and it is my fa <hon>ther w<hoff>ho is posthumously adjudged the war criminal. At Yalta, with the sweep of a pen a senile president condemns a third of the world to communism. Europe, with the zeal of a missionary gone mad, hands over the wealth and resources of Africa to  <hon>savages<hoff>who have barely learned to beat a drum. Then <hon>you.<hoff>.. ..give them tanks and arms to replace their bows and arrows.
People have been killed. Two in Geneva and one in New York. - Herr Maas or Kessler. What shall I say? - Please, call me Erich. Erich, this has all happened so fast, but look...
what does that mean? A dying might feel choked up, when he died there's a lump in his throat. That's a non-breathless death. Like I said, man must have air.  <hon>A corpse<hoff> must be breathless.
All I want to do is live and worship and kill in solitude and die in peace! - No more killing, James. No more killing. - You have to! You have to kill what you attack. If you draw blood and you leave it alive it carries over,
Keep shaking this stuff so I can fix my helmet. -What did you do, crack it? -Yeah, I gotta put that on it. -Some sort of a glue? - <hon>lt's <hon><ho<hoff>ff> epoxy resin.
Dorothy, where are those slippers now? I lost them. They fell off on the way back. Well, I think I know just the thing to cheer Dorothy up.  <hon>This electrical marvel<hoff> will make it possible for you to sleep again.
Oh, no.  <hon>They're<hoff>just rest <hon>ing. <ho <hon>ff><hoff>What are they doing in here? I put them in there. I didn't want the boys to get into trouble.
You have a weapon in your hands and a head on your shoulders Or, as our Commander says to live and never say What the heck, is not my way I've said it before, I'll say it again： A partisan never asks how many  <hon>fascists<hoff>are there? No. He a <hon>sks, "Where a<hoff>re the fascists?"
The same woman was seen in the neighborhood of Godolphin Street on the night of the murder and later made an emotional scene at Charing Cross Station. Now what do you think of that? Oh my dear Watson, you are so long-suffering, if I've told you nothing over these last few days it is because there is nothing to tell. Even now this report from Paris doesn't help us much. Well surely it's final as regards to Lucas' death. The man's death is a mere incident a trivial episode in comparison with our real task, which is to trace the document and save a European catastrophe.
Oh, uh... this social worker checked out my story. So the judge tells my parents to get their act together and take me home, because the hall is not a good place for a vulnerable adolescent. Home is better. Home sweet home. I think I get the picture.
Look, MacGyver, I can't spend the Foundation's money on a series of tests just because Carrie had a nightmare. Besides, I've never been a big believer in the dream research project anyway. Pete, you got no curiosity. Carrie's dream was really intense. And I just know  <hon>those researchers<hoff> would love to have another subject.
Is he around? I haven't seen him in a few days, but you <hon>might wanna  <h<hoff>on> try him  <hon><ho<hoff>ff> at the car lot on the next block over. - He owns a piece of that too. - AII right, thanks a Iot. Hey, nice, real nice.
Did I ever tell you the--? Pete, let's go! - Everybody out! - Let's go. - Where are  <hon>the American women<hoff>? - Gone. Across the border.
That he had a right to blow out the last candle for himself. I couldn't go through with it. So I go to his room and tell him. He's not mov- He's not moving.

- We have 'em all. - Korea. Laos and Cuban crisis. - We also have members from World War I. - [Man] What about you? - Vietnam. Vietnam was bad to begin with. Uh, it was...
- You got a lot of rain this weekend. - You're right. A lot of rain. I should be chopping by the neighbors, but, uh... we've got so much water standing in the field, it, uh... - [Clayton] You get stuck. - We get... Yeah. We'd mud up the hayfield, so... I could come over here and work today.
Has there been any situation where people couldn't cope with the public opinion... or anything like that? Well... there are factions that don't think much of the theater group... because they think we're too progressive, that we're trying to do too much too fast. But... anytime, I don't care where you are... if you try to be progressive... there are people that are trying to... keep things at a status quo. That's... That's just the human nature. What impresses me a lot about this town...  <hon>People<hoff> don't try to...  <hon>make y<hoff>ou think their way.
Am I gonna be farming 10 years from now? I don't know. There's a lo <hon>t of <hon><hoff>people prob<hoff>ably won't, and it's just a matter of elimination. Who's gonna come next? Who's gonna... That's one of the reasons I took the job is because... putting the money in a bank... and when <hon>the kids<hoff> get col <hon>lege<hoff>age... if they wanna go to college, I wanna give them that option. I would love to see all three of my kids go to college.
Our bills are paid, and the worst is over. I want you to manage the 1,123 francs that's left. It should last us for a year. In three months I hope to start selling my rabbits. If necessary, we could sell  <hon>my necklace.<hoff>
Thank you! My chickpeas are rotting. My apricots dried up. They're the size of small peas. My grapes won't make two casks of wine. What a year!
So that's him, Major Sholto. Uh-huh. If they're such good friends, why does he barely even mention him? He mentions him all the time to me, never shuts up about him. About HIM? Mm-hmm. Urgh!
What then? There will not be another Ro <hon>man C<hoff>atholic on the English throne.  <hon>The country people<hoff><hon>don<hoff>'t agree. They still adhere. They miss the Latin litanies and mysteries. The ornaments and precious things.
I have interests all over the world but... everything starts in England. If it works here... I try it in a real country. The United Kingdom, Petri dish to the Western World. Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need those letters so... I'm keeping them.

'You've seen a lot of injuries, then? Violent deaths? ' 'Enough for a lifetime.' 'Want to see some more? ' 'Oh, God, yes.' 'The game is on.'
John Dudley. Because I trust him. Look, I brought you something. What is it?  <hon>A puppet.<hoff>
Your bag is like magic. It has everything in it. Gondoa? That's in the northern mountains, isn't it? Yes.
I'm going to stop by the power plant to check the output levels. Power plant? Yes. Come on. The motor generates enough power for the entire valley.
I like it like that way so don't try to straighten it up. All right. Can we discuss Chelsea's defense? Well, in my opinion... we have to cloud the issues, get the focus off Chelsea. We have  <hon>two witnesses<hoff>. How ca <hon>n we<hoff> discredit them?
Archer is not your average dealer. And what about the pseudoephedrine? We'll worry about that tomorrow. Tonight we celebrate. Right but the pseudo, I mean, you do have it...
Luckily we have this document. Very interesting! It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region five years ago. Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries. Where does that leave us?
You too, Max. Friends forever? Friends forever. By the time you leave Space Camp, you will know the function of every circuit on the shuttle. You may never get the chance to fly in it, but it won't be because you don't know how.
This is what our world looked like four billion years ago, before there were any eyes to see. Until a few hundred million years passed, and then, one day, there was a microscopic copying error in the DNA of a bacterium. This random mutation gave that microbe a protein molecule that absorbed sunlight. Want to know what the world looked like to a light-sensitive bacterium? Take a look at the right side of the screen.
Never... Let a man screw you for nothing. My girls play a very smart game. They allow a man to believe he's in control. But my girls are always in control.
<hon>Avalanche Control<hoff>is about to detonate the charges. - Roger, Base. - Listen. They can't set those charges off when there's a chance MacGyver's still alive. I'm sorry. I know how you feel.
I could ask you the same question right now about those bracelets. Who goes to the gym with pavé diamond bracelets? These aren't fucking pave. They're not even close to pavé. You don't even know what pavé is.
You don't love me. Yes, I do. Do you think that I would do this for everyone? I've seen you do this for everyone. AL: You stink! My parents are home.
And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery. I will not. Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family's future.
She's upstairs. Did you find Jim? Yep. I followed Brian to his house, broke the door down, and I was going to break Jimmy's head when... she came out of the kitchen. Peg, her face was in a Jell-O mold.
Actually it's not. A dangerous artifact is bad enough, but this... this is rampant underage drinking. Oh, boo hoo, Nancy drew. We should call the police. Unbunch your panties, will you?
-Well, I'd even say that that's what I am here for. .... -I always paid you correctly. -You paid me correctly? You owe me 50 000 francs.
Don't you like them? I haven't met anybody here that I like particularly. They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny.
It opens minds. On the contrary, it's vital. Fashion can be art, too. No. I don't agree.
I approached it as a state, a kind of sensory sleep, and I looked for a motif to bring it to life. I chose the poppy, and I portrayed its stages and its evolution. I was also interested in its contradictions, its beauty and its ugliness I used needle-painting techniques to illustrate the delicacy of its youth. I made this one with cotton thread.
I want to tell my friends, about us. That's a big secret. You're sure, you can trust them? I trust them with my life. I have.
When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else. Never. But then one day, things change, and it's over. And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt. It does.
Manu, can you cover for me? - Sure, sure. Mrs. Letellier ? Right through here. Half an hour, my ass.
Oh, you sure it isn't overcooked? No, it's perfect. The truth is, you usually undercook turkey. This is just the way I like it. You've hated all the other <hon>turkeys<hoff> I've ever cooked for you?
He's clearly casing the house. Mr. Powell, that's a tree. I'll take that card now. "I see when men love women. They give them but little of their lives."

Like being at anchor in the Med. Some protective oils for our guests and a little suntan. Ha ha! This is the life. Hey mister, would you call the  <hon>ladies<hoff>off?
Just hold your water. Hey, Colombo, maybe the  <hon>Japs<hoff> took off... when they saw that we're here in force. - Maybe, huh? - Stop dreaming, Chubby. They are dug in ten, twenty feet underground.
Now that's what I call a dead prawn. This prawn is definitely deceased. When I bought it half-hour ago, you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out. Say, "No, no, it's resting." - Say, "No, no, it's resting."
You make it sound like a blooming game. That's precisely what it is... and the first one to reach a hundred billion souls is the winner. He doesn't stand a chance actually. I've only got six to go. What happens when you get them?
- What are you doing? - Enough of this frou-frou shit. And good things continue to develop for New York's youngest hero, Ricky Lapinsky. Earlier today, Lapinsky's parents received an offer from Macaulay Culkin for the film rights... That's the kid from "Home Alone." I love that movie.
Well, with the new owner coming what about Barney? Look, Barney's not gonna forget his little magic act. You put your bucks in the glove compartment and he'll turn them into pints. There's some <hon>people<hoff> outside. - Can't they read the 'No Vacancy' sign?
Well, I was upset. I told Dailey I was gonna call the police. And you think maybe those  <hon>boys<hoff> know about it? They don't want me running the motel. All right. I'm not.
He's so superstitious. This is no superstition. I passed math and English because of these. Didn't you say you failed because of No. 469? Ueda, go to the  <hon>girls<hoff>' room like that and get some food.

And they were the first team I heard of who did that. The EHOME manager copying down the draft, doing the prep work. He was their coach. There was a great interview that was done. And it lined up all the top European captains who attended and the topic was EHOME.
But the fate of the army and of the fatherland are in the hands of a good minister and a bad general. Barclay is delaying action. The whole army is critical of him.  <hon>The French<hoff> are at Vitebsk. In four days they may reach Smolensk.
Duke Astorre, are you here? You said we should meet here. The young Turkish girls are abducted from their parents who love them. Or purchased from parents who love gold more. Though the women are slaves, their lives are better in the harem.
They made me. It's... it's all right, Graciela. They want numbers to the safe. Please, I don't want them to hurt you. I-I don't remember the combination.
Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion wouldn't drink their vodka! "It's no day for that" is what they said. Carried into a wide extent of country. In that open country I have a father and son and sister at Bald Hills.
What Hank did was foolhardy. But his purpose was righteous. What he did was set off a storm. Those witches used a spell, I'm sure of it. We need those witches to get the government off our backs.
Are you ready for this? Well, now that we're no longer man and wife, I'll sleep on the other side. If that bed tilts up and I fall in the pool, I'm leaving. Do you have a plan? What is it?
- Where do you keep your wallet? - It's gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color. It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that <hon>dress<hoff> is you.
I'm so proud of you. We need to discuss the Council. We've never had young witches on the Council, and Queenie and Zoe deserve an elevated role here at the school to set them apart. What do you think? I would start by telling them that being an authority figure requires you to make hard, unpopular decisions for the greater good.
- It's okay. - We can be sad about that later. Right now, I just want to freak out because my baby sister is getting married! Let me see the ring. - [Both gasp] - I need to get it sized
Captain, it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations. In the mythology of your race, this is called "sympathetic magic". Jackson, the crew member who returned to the ship. You wondered what killed him. I made an image of him. In the essence of my thoughts, the image was Jackson.
-  <hon>Creature<hoff>, Mr Spock? - lt turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well considered and intelligent. Yes. Well, it could have been many light years away from us.
Miami only has Marino with the golden arm and some fat cheerleaders. They have no running game. It's like two virgins. Can't find the damn hole. That's why they get blitzed all the damn time. Understand? I can't believe you guys.
Why don't you just leave it alone? Because it's not enough, Dede. Don't you understand? This regime is insane! Do you know that Trujillo has a secret campaign to make our population whiter than it is?
Get out. He was my father as well. Let's go. If the errant is under 18 he will be sent to a correctional home or to the countryside to cultivate the land or do whatever the government decides. Correct.
Senora Mirabal, you have a beautiful daughter. Thank you. Go get your grandma. It is a great honor to have you here in Ojo de Agua. I love to drop by on people.
You go ahead. Have a good night, sir. So he killed that woman right there in front of you? But not to his way of thinking. You see, to him he hadn't killed a woman, he'd destroyed a demon.
The bodies come out pink. - The gas turns them pink. - That's a nice touch. If it is alreaduy built, what is this meeting? Whuy bother?
You understand? Absolutely. Yet, at the risk of sounding-- For thousands of years men have believed in an enclave of islands known as the Forbidden Islands where mermaids breed. In Greek mythology,  <hon>Sirens<hoff> were originally bird women.
Pale for weariness. Eh? Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us. Your boots, what are you doing with your boots? I'm leaving them there.
We'll see when the time comes. I was saying that things have changed here since yesterday. Everything oozes. Look at the tree. It's never the same pus from one second to the next. The tree, look at the tree.
- Come see! - Let's go back. Come here and look. Watch this. On this side, your face is backwards.
I have no idea what it means. Meanwhile, we must proceed with our rescue mission. Something amuses you? Perhaps you'll share the joke with me. The joke is you! Strange gratitude, from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream.
It's a personal affair. My son's been arrested. I have to go to Warsaw. But  <hon>it's  <ho <hon>ff> not tha<hoff>t. The problem is, in a month, I'm supposed to go to Libya.
Say, Johnny... Johnny I want you to put away your 25 cents. So she never escaped? There's only really one escape from Oldfield. I have something I want to show you. These are the original town records.
Don't try anything with her, Mr. Gallen. I warn you. She's my friend. The magistrate teaches us that there is a right time for everything. A time to plant, a time to kill, a time to destroy, a time to grieve, a time for hating, a time for war.
I'm getting there. Well, I'm not superstitious but I was thinking about  <hon>these  <hon>thing<hoff>s < <hon>hoff><hoff>  and why they came. Uh-huh. And... This will really sound silly, but it's like they were watching or listening.
Flotsam. Jetsam. She's scared. Come on,  <hon>you guys<hoff>. Where are you hiding?
Eternity is nigh Let us use the time that remains to try To serve the Lord with heart and mind So that our true home we shall find  <hon>The stars<hoff> have moved closer.
I explained everything and I encouraged  <hon>him<hoff>to stay. Ginger, have the girls fix some sandwiches. Why are you looking so <hon>glum?<hoff> I lost Cherry's chip back on that mule. Kind of wipes out the whole deal, doesn't it?
Small-town morgue night watchman! Give me the piece. What you offered me yesterday. Careful, it could go off! What did you say?
- No, of course not. How dare you hurt my horse! I'm going to destroy you people now! I'll take so much Lagaan you won't have a rag to your backs! You bloody slaves will remain crushed under our boots!
I don't remember anyone telling me you were a member of Starfleet. My Vulcan rank supersedes yours. Apples and oranges. This is an Earth vessel. You're in no position to take command. As soon as we're through here, I'll contact Ambassador Soval.
Only when I'm happy Can't you cheer up for me Most people drink when they're down, but not you You're weird! No, I'm not
When? In the end, it says. See? In this new research facility we observe neutrinos which are generated by the collision of cosmic rays and air, through 50,000 tons of super pure water.
Just planting things. Wow, that's not bad. - Feel it. - I can see it. Those bones have kept very well.
Sure, the Romans and their broads. Not men, women. But they're just bodies, man. The crimes committed in Spain. They buried them... so no one would see them.
You'll know when the story has run its course... If you still live. But you said I won't die. I fear for my parents... What does this story hold for them?
Your life is now split into two. The twenty years you've already lived and the short time you have left. Have you ever known love? You never will. Do you hear that clock?
-Did you like the show? -Yeah! I liked the fire the best. You're really hot! Holy shit. I brought the book so you can remind me of the story.
Loneliness... Loneliness stretches over miles and miles In my dream I saw a hand in my hand Now I am blinded by the shards of a shattered dream Someone was here yesterday but today there is no one
Two rice rolls, please! Okay! Just a minute. Ramen noodles for them. Rice rolls over there.

-could you see the pretty girls? -perfectly well. Yes, when looking at women, my sight works all right. I can see a little better. But the distance was from here to where you are now.
Now this is a princess ! It's the first time I've come in contact with the magic of my homeland in a while, but there's nothing I can do. I've decided to use this body and live as an ordinary human. Once I leave this place, I will cast off my eternal life and even my former memories. I don't need this anymore.
Maybe. You kids are going to flunk. How rude. If we do, we'll drop out. We'll graduate fine, and apply to college, too. Do you want to try growing flowers?
Not infested. Blessed. He is our Anointed, and I have made myself our host. I am mother to an army. An army of angels to protect us.
But I would still prefer a platoon of Lancers. They're on the move! Back to the village now! Go! Get everyone inside on the floor!
Go! Get everyone inside on the floor! The slavers don't want to take us, they want to kill us! GO NOW! Go. Home.
But they always had the highest percentage of calls for vengeance. So as soon as possible. There's just so much to consider. Planning the wedding, new cars, house and babies. You have to plan for babies, or they'll just run roughshod over your entire existence.
- So... You should be reading Car And Driver instead of Sand Surf. Someone put the wrong type of fluid in the car's transmission. You see, Ford automobiles use a thick red type F transmission fluid. General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with Dexron.
Stop, stop, stop. What you got? Looks like, uh ... Something or ... someone smashed up against this chute pretty hard. What floor are you on? Uh ... between, um ... first and second, I think.
Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body. Check this out. This fabric matches the victim's sweater. That's the muffler. Now, this is the back of the car. And the taillight was smashed.
That's why I don't understand why you'd bring towels that eventually could be traced. I don't know what you're talking about. Strong's Gym. That's where the women told you to get lost, right? Stuffing club towels down their throat make your point?
I just don't want anybody to get hurt. Well, since you can't freeze us, you probably can't blow us up either. Just keep your hands where we can see them. All right, so the Banshee. Well, they're pretty rare.
Well, that doesn't mean that you can't. - Just concentrate and relax. - Relax? - Are you kidding? - Paige, just close your eyes, take a deep breath, feel the magic rising from a place of strength.
Damn it. Now would not be a good time. I am only gonna say this once. The real world better start showing me some respect, otherwise, I'm gonna stop saving it every week. - What happened?
Left. Nice. And brunette. Brunette? I saw the back of her head once.
What have you been up to today? - Working. - Really? You and Jason worked things out? No, we can't seem to agree on the locus equidistant of points.
Father... Sandeman. Sandeman named you. OK. Guard! Guard.
- This is the dark time Liam. The seconds between seconds. Ha'gel... why are you here? To guide you on the next step of your journey. A Kimera spirit used this woman as an instrument to push you to the brink of human despair.
I believe I can answer that, captain. Hello, children. I'm Dr Phlox, the ship's physician. I'm from a system called Denobula Triaxa, and I feel very honoured to be part of this important mission. Germs.
- His parents planned the union. It's their decision. Boy. Where I come from, arranged marriages went out with slavery. Are you going to give me advice or criticize my people's tradition?
Aeryn... I got it. It all fits, everything fits. I-I-I know how to do this. I can build this thing, I know what it does!
I got it. It all fits, everything fits. I-I-I know how to do this. I can build this thing, I know what it does! Can it destroy the Dreadnought?
Sorry-sorry-sorry. Alright. Alright. Ha-have you spoken to your females yet? I'll bet you haven't spoken to them yet.
Gone now. Are you sure he's gone? Long gone. Grunschlk. You... you use these poor beings as donors! Doc couldn't operate else!
Roll up your sleeve. Do I have to take orders from him, sir? I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor. After all, this man is working for me. You only think he's working for you!
And where is he now? I, ah, wonder what that  <hon>information<hoff> would be worth? Now let me see. I'll burn it out of him. No!
No, talk, hurry up, I have no time to lose. What I wrote in my letter, I learned in prison. Once out, I thought it might be useful. I wasn't wrong, it seems. You know, you learn things in prison.
Mostly barefoot. This is your country. What do you think happened to these people? Bandoleros. They demand too much of the  <hon>people<hoff>.
I'll have to brush up on local history. Wait till you meet the little old ladies who run the inn. They're all descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew, and they're proud of it. "Buccaneer bazaar tonight. Help save Blackbeard's Inn." What does that mean? Some guy is trying to have the inn torn down, but the old ladies are putting up a pretty good fight.
I want you, what your name is, on the right. Your name, on the right! Do you not know your right? You, on the right! Where I'm pointing now!
Help! Come back, Grandpa! Hey, Grandpa, come back. What do you think you're doing? I'm being abducted by  <hon>foreigners<hoff>!
Hey, Grandpa, come back. What do you think you're doing? I'm being abducted by <hon>foreigners<hoff>! Faster, Daddy, faster. Where do they think they're going? Look out!
-You don't say! -Gunilla was never content. - Her, too? Do you know what I think? I don't think <hon>women<hoff> ever existed!
It would scare our rulers stiff! What? Nothing to complain about? That mustn't stop us complaining! So you think it's all right as it is? How about our  <hon>nursery care and household help<hoff>?
It doesn't suit you. You'll age before your time. Kalonike, I'm...furious because of these women. We're not reliable like the <hon>men<hoff> say. Yes.
Yes, but where is Halliwell? Dr. Goodwin tried to help him. Dr. Goodwin? Where is Goodwin?  <hon>The fire.<hoff>
- Don't talk to the prosecutor like that! Why not? I'm a technician upholding Japanese law. "Technician"! What a laugh! But the <hon>ladies<hoff> don't laugh.
Tokuyasu, this is no place to say such things! I don't give a damn who hears it. You've accepted nearly one billion yen from my company! I gave you plenty in return! Your <hon>company<hoff> was going bankrupt.
- With a diaphragmatic voice. - Diaphragmatic? "My dear, I know you're suffering because of me, so I suffer too. Schemers,  <hon>blasphemers and wretches<hoff> want the worst for me. Red Flag!
Well, why? You think they use their detersives? The liquids, yes, but not the ammonia ones. When you visit people's homes, do you sell more <hon>to men<hoff>or women? Men.
Come on! Dennis, you know, she wasn't frightened at all? She just looked a little surprised. I feel like we're married now, don't you, Dennis? Like really married?
Where be these enemies? See what a scourge is laid upon your hates, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. And I, for winking at your discords, too, have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. All are punished!
I don't understand. Veronica Vogler has come... and I'm the only one who can tell you where she is. Look closely at my feet, Artist. Have you seen younger, tighter arches? Look closely.
Oh, Frank, thank you. I thought I saw the house cringe as we drove up. It had been a dignified old Victorian  <hon>home<hoff> when Frank and I found it. The only one large enough that we could afford. The plumbing wasn't the most modern, the roof had to be repaired.
Got some contemplation goin'; I see things like they are. - I coulda told you all this was comin'. - What's coming? Jim, it's happening right under our noses and we can't see it.
Please try to bear that in mind. But now, would you please accompany me? Who are the inhabitants of this planet? Platonians. I'm sure you've never heard of us. Our native star is Sahndara.
Nothing personal, but I'm allergic to you. Then you will get rid of her, won't you, Serena? Reluctantly, coz, reluctantly. I do hate to undo such a good deed. My, that sherry was strong.
It's a way of helping the  <hon>poor unfortunate Jews<hoff>. How is it going to help them? They are poor, misguide people who understand nothing. They fight against our Fuehrer because they don't get it. They are a lost nation which understands nothing.
How much nicer our bathroom is. - She looks like the milk woman. - Ssh! You're not at the dairy. Darkness.  <hon>This bloke<hoff> had the plague so he hanged himself dead.
is using you at all? Tell me, General, what goal is used by your team? Goal? I think we tell  <hon>them<hoff> all paths lead to the Control Room. Something like that.
Take this. - Did you see anything? - No. Those damn candirus wanted to get inside us. Funny! I'd swear I saw fish here yesterday.  <hon>Fish<hoff> used to be people like us.
Towhilethetimeaway, hekilledantsinthepark. Good morning, my friend. - I'll sell you my  <hon>duck<hoff>. - What f or? It stinks. Yeah, it stinks.
You will not use the excuse of that pathetic... that humorous document to blackmail me! Mr. Lowther, you are a witness to this. Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported accusations against my name and yours. If she has one authentic shred of evidence... just one, let her bring it forth! Otherwise, if one more word of this outrageous calumny reaches my ears, I shall sue!
Ah, yes. Am I right- in thinking there's a real frog in here? Yes, a little one. What sort of  <hon>frog<hoff>? A dead frog.
This is of course symptomatic of a new breed of footballer, as it is indeed symptomatic of your whole genre of player, is it not? Good evening, Brian. What I'm getting at, Jimmy, is you seem to have discovered a new concept- with the mode with which you dissected the Italian defense- last night. I hit the ball first time- and there it was in the back of the net. Do you think Jarrow will adopt- a more defensive posture- for the first leg of the next tie in Turkey?
Then silence and stillness and night were the universe. I had swooned... yet shadows of memory reflect dimly... upon the inner walls of my mind shadows of tall figures... that lifted and bore me down, down... to a place of flatness and dampness and silence. Silence... and all is madness. I would not open my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back unbound.
-It was us. We said everything we knew, nothing but compliments, I swear. A razor. A gift to you from Antoine and me. The water's hot.
A razor. A gift to you from Antoine and me. The water's hot.  <hon>Your things<hoff> await you, they're here, cleaned and ironed. Hey!
A little guitar, a little atmosphere, and it wails like this. Wherever you are tonight A feeling tells me that you look out of sight So I'm gonna blow you <hon>a kiss<hoff> In the wind
Do you think you aren't? I know every one of you is mine. So, you're all dear to me. But if you don't love me and if you don't think I'm your dad, then I am not, right? But  <hon>people<hoff> have always said that we aren't your kids, that our fathers are all different.
So, you're all dear to me. But if you don't love me and if you don't think I'm your dad, then I am not, right? But people have always said that we aren't your kids, that our fathers are all different. And they didn't just tell me, but also Jiro, Hanako and Shiro.
It's you, me, Miss Patty, Rory, Babbette. Babbette, you're coming, right? - Doll, I'm sorry, I won't be able to make it. - Babbette, no. We're having Morey's parents over for dinner.
Perry, put a hold on that relay to Two. I want to wait for the result to the Athens operation. MYRA: No. Send it now. Myra.
That's like what I was saying about this place. I used to feel like I was allergic to high school and how come nobody else seemed to feel it? I felt like I was allergic to everything. I didn't want to keep anything in my body. [bell rings]
- That's completely ridiculous. You're entitled to every bit of happiness you can grab. - Really? I think this next chapel is going to be the one. It's not too big, it's romantic...
I think we should let her go on the ski trip. I mean, I see her trying and I think she should be rewarded. - You're letting her manipulate you. - She is not. This approach might be working, and that would be wonderful, but only if we stick with it.
How dare you speak to me like that! You old gas-bag! You're a nut! You need help! You'll be hearing from my representatives, Cresswell!

- I'll worry about you all day. - Then I'll do it. For you. You're a good man. I'm waiting for someone. The door is broke.
They were sent to me as a promotional thing. Really? Is there a Nipple Council? Do nipples have a bad rap? Nipples are huge right now. Open any magazine. It's not that cold.
So you need to make a choice. Me or this. It's not about having big hands. Most guys' hands are too rough with the details. Mine are sensitive.
Any chance they traveled to the same location? Maybe a conference or something? Accessing passports and e-mails. No conferences, but I'm looking through crime photos, and I did find a link. They each received identical packages --
He was brilliant. He was crazy. What if he isn't guilty? What if Gordon is just a patsy for somebody else? Go on.
The boats fled, because long-line fishing is illegal in the Galapagos, and we were left with the lines. I hopped in the water as soon as I could and brought my cameras in and tried to film, whatever I could find on the long lines, and we swam for probably two or three kilometres, pulling ourselves along the lines, and unclipping every baited hook we could find. The first fish I found was a seven-foot-long sailfish, and it was dead. It suffocated because it wrapped itself up in the long line.
The name's not half bad. Prime Minister Kayabuki. Operatives marked with "bon*" character tattoos belonging to Generalissimo Ka Ru-Ma's loyalist group ... *The kanji character 梵 (bon), meaning Buddhist. ... have been commiting suicide one after another in the country. Even his eldest son Colonel Ka Gae-Ru has just killed himself. And yet, you still insist that there is no need to interrogate the Generalissimo?
That is prime waterfront property. I'm building a luxury hotel, a spa, three restaurants. All of Miami will gain. Yes, by displacing hardworking people. I'm doing them a favor.
You find it, huh? Who are you? Haven't you read? I'm the green arrow. Well...
You know, in the past, people would say, "You'd never be able to get to the moon, not in a thousand years." And they'd look up the next day and they're going to the moon. You know, when I first met Jacque 25 years ago and he would talk to some people about certain inventions, they'd say, "You won't see that -- not in a thousand years." And ten years later, they come out with it on the cover of popular science. The whole basis of the technology is to maintain a high standard of living.
Anything that occurs beyond their comprehension they have to invent an excuse for. They have to create gods and demons to account for things because people come to the leadership of that community. No matter how primitive the tribe. They say, "How come bad wind blow people off island?" The guy says, "You not behave good, you not make enough contribution to volcano.
The death had nothing to do with malpractice or the quality of care provided. What about the therapeutic value of having family around during surgery? - Look- - You keep saying "look"! Heart surgery in the United States costs $90,000 all in.
Good. I wanna beat the crap out of you. Less good. And I'll tell you why. You're a bully.
She and her friends are gonna be here all night. Paying 'em 50 bucks a head, plus tips. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Hey, every good party needs a hostess, Billy, and we've got ten of 'em. Ten strippers, actually.
New purpose. I came halfway around the world looking for proof, threw him out the door. No one returns my phone calls anymore. They all think I'm insane. I don't.
What the hell's going on, dad? After Mom died... you were in juvie. They put me with this... this foster father down on Pershing Avenue. He punished me, locked me up. If you leave someone alone in the dark for that long, their eyes start to adjust.
Then you went away again, right? You don't think it killed me to leave you like that? To leave in the first place? Since the beginning, I was the problem. Since day one.
You push my father, Jake, he'll push back. What do you want me to do? - I've got Jonah. - What about those pallets? - I don't see them.
Trudy? This isn't asphalt. It's too brittle. It's shattered like a windshield. I have no idea what this is. Hey, did they get the children out?
Da-Ta! Captain hero is here. Your velcro-Powered super shoes . And endless capacity to hug can't save you now I love pounding beavers! Oh, i sure gave that hairy ass a licking! Ha! This is one dude Who knows how to avoid pussy.
All of this... I didn't think I'd ever see you again. What the hell happened ? You just disappeared. I'm sorry.
This site was in Stark's browser history. He visits at least twice a week. Why's he trolling personals if his girlfriend's moving in ? I tried emailing the women he liked, in order to find out. But I ended up getting the same auto response from every one of them, "not interested."
You refused to negotiate! - You mean give in. What do you care anyway? It's not like your people were gonna use the coal! Oh, yeah, that's right.
That reduces water loss, but it also makes them very distasteful. At least the conifer's seeds are edible but they're protected within armor plated cones and it takes a specialist to reach them. The crossbill's extraordinary beak can prise apart the scales, so that it's tongue can extract the seeds. Birds are fortunate. When the seasonal crop is gathered, they can fly south
In reality, it's a huge weasel. It's bulk helps to conserve body heat and also broadens it's menu. It's so big and powerful, it can even bring down an adult caribou. For it's size, it's said that the animal can eat more in one sitting than any other which is why it's also known as the glutton. Being gluttonous here is a very effective strategy.
I was like, yeah, but not till like 2 o'clock. So it became this kind of useful tool. Aside from being able to kind of shoot her and-- and have something. Because they-- you really buy-in to the "Playboy" mythos when you get there. Because they're just like, all the play-- you know, "Playboy" bunnies have loved these photo shoots because they have something to look back on years later to see how beautiful they looked at that time of their life.
God, you dressed-- dressed formal for tonight's affair. You got your button-down shirt and shit. It's cold. Not here, obviously. That shirt wards off the cold, does it?
There are loads of young mothers who find a boyfriend like me. "I'm going to have my own wee house and family and if I have a baby he'll stay with me". But it's not true, it's all lies. They just want you and then leave you. Me and my best friend Sarah, me and her's bought a house, and it is in Brookfield Place in Ardoyne.
Even if it's the most painful thing you've ever had to do. I think it's better to have someone. See this skin, O'Malley? It looks a little jagged. Does it look jagged to you?
No one gets left behind. If you say, "Live together, die alone," I'm gonna punch you in your face. Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. But we have a plan.
He's gonna look like he's been in a fight. With a cat. That Boston, Frank? Spoke to an Officer Malloy. It's his case up there. Confirms the MOs are the same.
Most days the morphine affects his memory. Let's hope this isn't one of them. Stuff the crocus. Do you have a cigarette? Cigarettes put you here.

No, Jackie, no. Oh, wait. I mean, bye! So, it's just not fair. He doesn't, like, get my friends... 'cause he has some stupid, crappy basement. Right!
Captain's comin' up with that FBI guy. He's got a fuckin' entourage. Listen up, everyone. Briefing room in 2 minutes for show and tell. All right. The Bay Harbor Butcher case. is now a Miami Metro case.
Six commanders and 1 3 support. Really? How many people are gonna guard where these guys are taken to? -Not the numbers you' re hoping for for a massive attack and rescue mission. T ell Special Operations at Ft. Bragg to submit plans for unilateral op. -They have an hour.
Look at that. Elmo's completely covered in clouds. You can't even see the men anymore. My problems are so small. I thought it was heading west.
With the kids. Because my husband and I came to the house separately. There were photos of him getting on the plane alone. Ma'am, this is uncomfortable territory, and obviously, I'd... . The press has sources that say you and the president...
I didn't really get a good look. That's okay. I don't feel like answering phones. Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? "Women will be sent home
How do you do it? You know what I'm talking about, don't you? There's this world, and there's the world where you live out your sick fantasies. When did it start? Was it after your breakdown in '95?
Okay. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want... Chinese? Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
Yes, you. What do you think you're doing in this office? I'm with an fbi agent who'd like to ask you the same question. Dr Parenti, isn't it? I'm in the middle of a delicate procedure. Whatever you want, you can't barge in here. I don't care who you are.
Wait! There's more. Savin' the best for last! Got a sweet tooth? You like baklava? Here's three more layers of pure delight.
- How? - I just did. - How? I've gotta go. This discussion is not over.
Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top-secret device, which he simply calls IT. So what exactly is IT? Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. Thanks, Tom. Oh! Thanks, Tom. So far Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention.
More company! Deputy Chief Johnson. Thought you said this place wasn't listed yet. It's not supposed to be. Yes, Lieutenant, what is it?
I've been setting up these dominos for, like, three days. Got to tell you, it's very Zen. It gets you very centered. Wow. This is the kind of thing I never have time for. Ain't almost nobody does.
- But there's gonna be a price. - Name it. - Who was she? - My sister.  <hon>Corporations<hoff> like Umbrella think they're above the law.
I gave her a ring. You can use this to start up your girl's college education. You can beef up your retirement fund. You can maybe take some pressure off you and janet so you can, I don't know, work things out... for once.
I've been a bad, bad girl. Oh, my God. What the fuck is that? One of the Hive's early experiments... produced by injecting the T-virus directly into living tissue. The results were unstable.
It's hard to translate because it's nonsense. Something about a frog and a butt and a saint. Seriously. That's funny. Point of it is, however, that if things are not good today,
It's so beautiful, look at this. It's a fine computer. I would have called you to have this conversation, but I don't even have a freakin' phone. You see the disperity here, big guy? Save it.
I'm gonna kill you, Earl. I'm going to rip off your face and wear it to the ugly ball. That's scary and hurtful, Glen. You're a dead man. My uncle Roger once had a pet pig.
I'm going to have to call you back. No, nothing bad happened. My girlfriend's on the other line. Maybe I do have a girlfriend! Mom, why can't things be easier between us? I saw a cop car with the keys and I had to steal it.
They framed your dog? Yeah, maybe theydid frame my dog, Natalie. It's not totally unprecedented. What about "Mr. Monk and the Panic Room"? They tried to frame a monkey, didn't they?
I just thought maybe this timeit would be different. I should have knownI'd be wrong. Great. Spotted-- lonely boy's rude awakening. Upper east side queens aren't born at the top.
We're in this predicament because dad has a drug problem. I was trying to help him then help him. Your father's acting the way that he is because he's scared. He needs you so much right now,more than he ever has. We all do.
My sources aren't that good. But yours are. - What's that? - Ampicillin. It's an antibiotic.
Oh, I love you. Juliet? Where is she? Thank you. Thank you, Jeremy.
I can treat her so she won't feel any pain. The cameras show her on this aisle. She stopped, next thing, she's looking at the floor. [Cooper] Maybe a camping accident ? Something traumatic.
Well, the results came back. - It was rasagiline. - I've never heard of it. It's not exactly in my wheelhouse either. Rasagiline... is a therapeutic drug approved last year by the F.D.A.
# But some girlie out there must be needy for a weedy shy guy # # They want you as their needle when they're rolling in the hay # # Just hear me out when I say # # Bret, you've got it going on # # The ladies will get to know your sexuality #
- Um, Mr. Armstrong? - Please call me David. - Okay, David. - Thank you. Um, David, when will this meeting actually begin?
Wait, don't be afraid! Come here! In reality, Laika's real name was Kudriavka... which means "fuzzy" in Russian. She became known all over the world as Laika... which wasn't her name but her breed... a type of Eskimo dog. Laika was the first living creature to enter orbit around earth... on November 3, 1957, in Sputnik 2.
Oh, please. Well, uh, there's an official reason for my visit. I need your husband's computer. It's a 2003 Macintosh G4. Uh, Walt's computer?
We're at 850 degrees celsius. Are you there yet? Yeah. but not for long. Inside the main control panel of the dish array is an override switch. You need to manually aim the dish directly at the lake to get it to flash boil the water.
- Where are you going? What are you looking for? This lake is the way to Canava. - Canava? - Yes, that's where a soul takes a rest. When the full moon shines on the lake, it opens the gate, then souls in the form of birds go to Canava through the lake.
And they were filming when it happened, but it did indeed melt. Luckily, it was toward the end of the shoot, so it wasn't that big of a disaster. During that early era of new visual effects people were not specialists. So the model makers were painters the painters were model makers, and on Blade Runner, that was the case. When you'd approach a model, you'd look at the drawing, the illustration and kind of break it down into its component shapes.
I didn't teach you Muay Thai so you could go start fights with others. That's when we learned that Kru Tiew was fierce. But we also learned that he did those things to make us strong as well. It's probably because... He didn't want Muay Chaiya to be lost with him... he said that once. Chaiya is fighting and strategy, at the same time... Going over offence and defense internally. Remember that crouching does not mean its over.
We understand you run a custom motorcycle shop out of this place. Yeah,so? So,you got an angel 56 around here? Used to. That bike was seen leaving a murder scene this morning.
I mean, I certainly try to... I would say I probably do. - A day. - A what? You're going to love this.
I didn't know anything was up until he,uh,came and got the phone. That's when I saw the piece. Then I handed him the phone. Excuse me,did you say piece? Uh,yeah,revolver of some sort.
The vertical lines behind me represent alliances. The horizontal lines are the alliances' attacks. Two weeks ago, there were seven alliances running neck and neck for the million-dollar prize. Till that point, "Primacy" operated like any good game, with leaders surging and ebbing in expected patterns. Ten days ago, a whole different story emerges.
- As a lawbreaker, you agree with this? - Yes, I do, captain. I will get you the law books. Keep the proceedings in writing. You will send the findings and the sentences to me, and if everything is in order the sentence will be ordered for execution.
We have our sergeants. We maintain order and discipline as best we can! We stand in line to get what little food they give us. We don't steal or betray each other to the Rebels. I am saying that men can be excused if they do extreme things, necessary things in order to stay alive in a place like this!
Get the fuck outta here! She fired at you? Near us, yeah. Then why did you lie to the investigators about how she performed? They'd already put together their own bullshit version of the story... ..before they talked to me.
I just want to get something clear. This time, just want somebody to be a hero. I want to get something right. Yeah. Cos AI Bathra, you know... AI Bathra. You talked to Boylar's parents?
Yeah. And, uh... ..the captain was a big hero... She died tragically in the desert, and Major... - Teegarden. - Teegarden... ..wants her to get the Medal of Honour, so she'll get it. When did the M-16 ammo run out? What? M-16 ammo? Blackhawk crew said they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.
- How much? - Twenty-five. What do you know? I have money. When things were the worst for me... just before I tried to kill myself... I used to hallucinate things. I'd close my eyes, and all I would see were... snakes and bugs everywhere.

When Mr. Elton joined their hands today, he looked very much as if he would like the same kind office performed for him. Invite him for dinner. That is kindness enough. Mr. Elton is a man of 26. He knows how to take care of himself.
Master, follow me!" You know? That's good. I like it. "Igor". "It's alive!" You know. I had this idea about the geese.
I had this idea about the geese. I've been watching the way they've been following you. Even when you're on your four-wheeler. It occurred to me that they just might follow my aeroplane too. - Amy, look. They're gonna try to fly away.
It's too late. They're back. Save yourself. Save the child. Jacques was right.
"He is teaching at a new school and I am studying at a training college." "The rules here are strict beyond belief and our visiting hours are limited," "but I would love to see you again." Your hands are rough, Jude. So would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day.
It's yours in exchange for a small favor. Get lost, pervert. Would you do me a small favor for a hundred guilders? Get lost, creep. You'll get old and die, too, one day.
Can you follow the story line and the plot? We've provided this kind of docudrama-type thing to inform some of the scenes so you know where you are. For instance, there's an early scene with the queen and her brother and her two sons which is outside in an anteroom waiting for the king to call them in because he is inside, sick. The queen is worried. She's afraid the king will die, who is her husband. And when he dies, the only... The only people left to inherit the throne are her two young sons by the king himself.
Therefore they think they can't, and you become totally self-conscious. American actors are not self-conscious. But they are when it comes to Shakespeare. Because they've been told they can't do it, and they foolishly believed that. Perhaps they don't go to picture galleries and read books as much as we do. I think it's the effect of how everyone looked and behaved that one got a sort of Elizabethan feeling of period.
- Because my name is George. Clarence what is the matter? Yea, Richard, as I know. But I protest as yet I do not. But, as I can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams. And from the cross-row plucks the letter G. And says a wizard told him that by G his children disinherited should be.
When the little hand gets between 4 and 5, that's 4.30. - I'm sorry. - You're not being punished. I'll be back. - We can go to your soccer game. - That's too long.
This city doesn't burn because I won't permit it. I'm the great negotiator. You think people get that? Truth is, they don't care. Dumb bastards don't even vote.
For my research. Are listed in the appendix Madam de Bellegarde. My future... for his benefit, I sign. But I have to add a condition that I am concerned about: This promise should not... neither before or after the marriage nor for any reason, appear in the court.
Get set. - Father! - My child. Well, well. Dick Steele.
You will also have money for the rest of your lives, which I trust will be many years. Here are the keys. You may move in as of now. But let us begin at the beginning. Our tale starts three months earlier.
Listen to you! You're obsessed! You've never seen what it can do! -I just saw it! -You've never seen it! You've never seen it miss this house, miss that house and come after you.
...which the tribe sacrifices, in an orgy-like ceremony, stripped naked, chained... to a bloody altar. I would like to go home. Orgies and chained, naked women? My God, Bob! Aw, hell, you pay too much attention to what people think.
Oh! Go slowly, James. Go carefully. Hey, go on! Here we are, setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house, going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse. Actually snowing at this moment, and more to come.
I'm Old Bailey. Remember me? Actually, I'm looking for the marquis. And a young lady named Door. Diversify! You can't sell rooks for the stewpot forever anyway, they taste like boiled slipper.
They were the first bankers because they started keeping other people's gold for safekeeping in their vaults. The first paper money in Western Europe was merely a receipt for gold left at the goldsmiths. Paper money caught on because it was more convenient than carrying around a lot of heavy gold and silver coins. Eventually goldsmiths noticed that only a small fraction of the depositors ever came in and demanded their gold at any one time. Goldsmiths started cheating on the system.
Eventually goldsmiths noticed that only a small fraction of the depositors ever came in and demanded their gold at any one time. Goldsmiths started cheating on the system. They discovered that they could print more money than they had gold and usually no one would be the wiser. Then, they could loan out this extra paper money and collect interest on it. This was the birth of fractional reserve banking - that is, loaning out many times more money than you have assets on deposit.
But then the money changers would tighten the money supply. They would make loans more difficult to get. What would happen? Just what happens today. A certain percentage of people could not repay their previous loans, and could not take out new loans to repay the old ones.
The Sovereignty movement calls for Congress to authorize the secretary of the treasury to issue $90 billion per year of U.S. Notes, not Fed notes nor debt-based bonds, to loan money, interest-free, to cities, counties and school districts for needed capital improvements. Remarkably, and to their praise, the community bankers association of Illinois, representing 515 member banks, has endorsed this Sovereignty proposal, a good step in the right direction. As Milton Friedman has repeatedly pointed out, no severe depression can occur without a severe contraction of money. In our system, only the Fed, the BIS, with U.S. bankers cooperation or a combination of the largest Wall Street banks could cause a depression. In other words, our economy is so huge and resilient a depression just can't happen by accident.
After WW I, the American public had grown tired of the internationalist policies of democrat Woodrow Wilson. In the presidential election of 1920, Republican Warren Harding won a landslide victory with over 60% of the votes. Harding was an ardent foe of both bolshevism and the League of Nations. His election, which opened a 12 year run of republican presidents in the White House, lead to an unprecedented era of prosperity known as the "roaring twenties". Despite the fact that the war had brought America a debt ten times larger than its civil war debt, still the American economy surged.
The only solution is to abolish the Fed and the fractional reserve banking system and withdraw from the BIS. Only that would brake the power of the international bankers over our economy. And keep in mind, a stock market crash itself cannot cause a severe depression. Only the severe contraction of our money supply can cause a severe depression. The stock market crash of 1929 only wiped out market speculators, mostly the small and the medium ones, resulting in $3 billion in wealth changing hands.
Dr. Funky." Does that qualify as a lead? Absolutely. - What's up? - Carmine reached out.
You want half the sundaypost? Well, afro got no relatives, And he owed me money. We're lookin' for evidence, Rosalie. Now, if somebody Were to come back in... After we seal the place up, That'd be up to them. Any money in here Is mine.
If you could bring me my timer maybe we could get away. You could come with us. There's no time. Tomorrow morning, stage two of the interrogation process will begin. Your friends will be killed here on 113. You'll be taken back to the Kromagg home world where you'll be tortured until they acquire the information they desire.
