How about in high school, Ma? "Don't worry, the girls don't know what <p>they</p>'re missing." They knew!
They knew, and <p>they</p> didn't miss it.
-Right. -Yeah. And what's going to happen is that it's later... that these kids are going to realize that... <p>they</p>'ve made a horrible mistake, you know.

And if this drug works, <p>it</p> could... set <p>it</p> all back to att<p>it</p>udes of fifty years ago.
I'd ask the mirror how <p>it</p> felt about that.
Now if <p>they</p> don't clear that raceway, the flow is permanently changed.
Yeah, <p>it</p> analyzes a probabil<p>it</p>y matrix for high-risk or dangerous cargo.

The body is going to do what <p>it</p>'s... going to do w<p>it</p>hout... wa<p>it</p>ing for your brain to catch up.
Of course, back then, the South was a very different place than <p>it</p> is today.
I appreciated that deal even though <p>it</p> was w<p>it</p>h the wh<p>it</p>est hip-hop label around.

When I'm worn out, <p>they</p> wake me right up.
I'm having trouble w<p>it</p>h my radio, <p>it</p> keeps cutting off.

Well, <p>it</p> used to be a nuclear disaster bunker, but don't worry.
The high is cerebral and clear but <p>it</p>'s relaxant and social at the same time.
I do. And <p>it</p>'s important to me too.
Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply that you have to be reminded <p>it</p>'s there at all.
Are <p>they</p> continuing?
I guess <p>it</p>'s worth 4 tickets.
I want <p>it</p> to mean something.

If <p>it</p> just opens,does that count?
Haven't <p>they</p> suffered enough ?
Once these deviant personalities collide, <p>they</p>'re deadly and unstoppable.
But why would you confess to killing these two women when you had no idea who <p>they</p> are ?
I didn't think <p>it</p> could get any hotter than yesterday.
"Say clearly what type of man <p>they</p> want.
We say <p>it</p> chirps:
We say <p>it</p> has an asymmetrical base.
Besides, <p>it</p> makes  <hon><p>it</p><hoff>  too shady.
Now we can make this problem go away... before <p>it</p> becomes a more expensive problem... if you catch my... drift.
Yeah, you know, <p>they</p> weren't all bad.
So <p>it</p> looks like my work-study job will be in the library, my journalistic career over before <p>it</p> even really began.

Which means that we will have to be really close to the surface of the sun if we wanna intercept that stream and deflect <p>it</p> before <p>it</p> can start spreading out.
The windows are supposed to be locked, but <p>they</p> clearly weren't.
These girls were crazy, and <p>they</p> hated Daniel.

Either <p>they</p> mean something or <p>they</p> don't.

I know <p>it</p> does.

Oh, I think <p>they</p>'re...
Some people say when <p>they</p> die <p>they</p> see a white light.

But however devastating avalanches may appear to us, when it comes to reshaping the Earth, <p>they</p> barely even scratch the surface.
Ice may be nothing more than frozen water but <p>it</p> holds extraordinary power.
This satell<p>it</p>e image reveals a huge area of flat ice, flat because <p>it</p>'s floating on top of an enormous lake.

No one knows for sure where the water ends up when <p>it</p> disappears into the moulins, but Konnie believes <p>it</p> flows straight to the base of the glacier.
So far no one has been able to prove if the melt water actually does reach the bedrock and lubricate the ice sheet, or if <p>it</p> simply flows through the ice, never reaching the bottom at all.
The camera seems to have reached a bend in the moulin and <p>it</p>'s not moving.
This would be bad enough on <p>it</p>s own but if the melt water is also causing the glaciers to accelerate into the sea, <p>it</p> could have very serious consequences.
The air is so cold that <p>it</p> holds almost no moisture so, in fact, Antarctica is the biggest and driest desert on Earth.
A friend of mine said that it's hard to get used to things when <p>they</p> change, but in the end... who knows?

Sadly, <p>it</p> is still s<p>it</p>ed as truth.
The central bank does not simply supply a government's economy w<p>it</p>h money, <p>it</p> loans <p>it</p> to them at interest.
Not only did <p>it</p> finance numerous aspects of H<p>it</p>ler's rise to power, along w<p>it</p>h actual materials during the war, <p>it</p> was also a Nazi money laundering bank. Which was eventually exposed for having millions of dollars of Nazi Money in <p>it</p>s vaults.
This tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world and woe is us, if <p>it</p> ever falls in the hands of the wrong people.
So you're saying that the building was actually designed to cope w<p>it</p>h a hole like that and would still survive? Yes, <p>it</p> was.
It is a private bank that loans all currency at interest to the government, completely consistent w<p>it</p>h the fraudulent central banking model that the country sought to escape from when <p>it</p> declared independence in the American Revolutionary War.

I could see the officer's body trembling. Finally <p>it</p> seemed like <p>it</p> just went limp.
Larks never will, you know When <p>they</p>'re captive
How can I promise that <p>they</p>'ll conspire in your favor even though you are the Queen?
Hey, these shoes look like <p>they</p> need a shine?
I can't get <p>it</p> to work.
Maybe that's how <p>they</p>'ll find me.
No. Yeah, <p>it</p> seems our l<p>it</p>tle show was a nice l<p>it</p>tle placeholder... - but <p>it</p> was time to get some ratings.

Who the hell knows why <p>they</p> were there.
One arm of the government said <p>it</p> would do something, does nothing.
Well, <p>they</p>'re about the same age, But <p>they</p> didn't appear to know each other, No shared interests, no mutual friends,
Because <p>they</p>'ve seen it online.
For generations,  <hon><p>it</p><hoff>  lay in a secret place marked by the sign of a pentangle and, as <p>it</p> was wr<p>it</p>ten, under the very gaze of Caesar.
But when the pathway gets dark, and <p>it</p>'s difficult to see the way...

Your pain gives you strength, <p>it</p> will guide you.
Can't live with them, especially if <p>they</p> change the alarm codes.
If you had asked them what <p>they</p> did for a living, <p>they</p> would have lied.

We have oil, and <p>it</p> seeps through the ground.
I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before <p>it</p> cracked.
Well, should we try this Scotch, or is <p>it</p> gonna release sarin gas when I open <p>it</p>?

The more weight <p>it</p> carried, the better <p>it</p> would ride.
To think that those  <hon>men<hoff>  lived thousands of years ago and you feel that <p>they</p> are just like the men of today.
- What did <p>they</p> decide?
- No, nor will <p>they</p> find me till I am ready.

If <p>they</p> find the right man <p>they</p> can give him the love and the understanding that all of us want but few of us get.

But if we played so <p>they</p> can also dance instead of just listen...

I have this neighbor, and he built his Jacuzzi in his bedroom... and <p>it</p> has a running aqueduct connected to a wading pool outside.
Trouble is, <p>they</p> only get to see him once.
She picks her victims because <p>they</p>'re young, <p>they</p>'re prettier... and a great deal more fortunate than her.

I don't know where <p>they</p> are.
Touch <p>it</p> a l<p>it</p>tle, <p>it</p> moves.
You touch <p>it</p>, <p>it</p> goes all over.

And make <p>it</p> good.
Now, the officials... <p>they</p>... <p>they</p> won't understand that.
The two suitcases, <p>they</p>'re still available.
It's just that <p>they</p>'re, you know, useless.

Kings and priests, <p>they</p> talk in riddles.
Will <p>they</p> vote for us?
You attempt to rule neat lines around yourself... making a fetish of your career... and making all relationships temporary... lest <p>they</p> disturb that career.

What, are <p>they</p> frigid?
You see, I discovered that <p>they</p> only like 100% pure cotton, pre-shrunk, and <p>they</p> demand the designer label.
Now, I've given this machine the peculiar name of egg inducer because <p>it</p> has the unique capabil<p>it</p>y of actually coaxing the eggs out of the chickens.
If you dread them, <p>they</p>'ll dislike you.
-I did. You'll think me mad. For a voice, I cannot tell whence <p>it</p> came, but I know whose <p>it</p> was replied.
Aren't <p>they</p> heavenly?
You'll see a bit of green when the rains come... if <p>they</p> come.

And it was only because U2 themselves, the band and Paul McGuinness, and everyone involved took so much appreciation from the fact that these fans had trudged through the Rocky Mountains in abominable weather and <p>they</p> were just determined not to let them down.
To reach that venue is a very, very long walk and those fans were virtually... When <p>they</p> went to the venue in the afternoon before the concert, <p>they</p> were pilgrims.
And I think this is one of the reasons why Bono and the band, with hearts as big as theirs, decided <p>they</p> weren't going to let anybody down and come what may, <p>they</p> were going to play to those people who had taken the effort to actually get there,

Now, unfortunately, <p>they</p> couldn't give us time to come across to be recipients of an award that <p>they</p> were given in Australia.
All right, we didn't have the biggest TV audience in the world but I can tell you that if a band performed live on The Tube and the fans liked what <p>they</p> saw, the sales of that band,
The fact that because of radio that <p>they</p> had created such a huge following of fans that actually then physically wanted to see them perform.
It was the most incredible journey and this is, I would suggest, virtually where <p>it</p> started.
The church's never going to progress if <p>it</p> isn't a b<p>it</p> adaptable.
These contests perpetuate the attitude that women are mere objects, to be judged and ranked according to how well <p>they</p> serve man.

Things aren't what <p>they</p> were.
My pipe, <p>it</p> should be here.

If <p>they</p> did, I never found out.

Off it goes and collects seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and <p>they</p> enter and dwell there.
When the unclean spir<p>it</p> is gone out of a man, <p>it</p> wanders over the desserts seeking the resting place and finds none.

She said <p>they</p> used to take a tea leaf... wrap up a lava rock in it... and <p>they</p>'d place it on the altar, and whatever <p>they</p> prayed for would come true.

You never consort with the suits, unless <p>they</p> consort with you first.
She doesn't even bother putting them in water, so, of course <p>they</p> die.
I heard <p>they</p> carry guns.
I was, uh... I was thinkin'about the syntax and how <p>it</p> affected the overall mood.
You sure <p>they</p>'re coming?
What the hell do you think <p>they</p>'re protecting, idiot.
Well, <p>it</p> was important.
Of course, there <p>it</p> is.
<hon><p>they</p><hoff>  were but one delight whenever I reflected on this wondrous life, and then with all my heart I prayed and begged the gods for this alone:

He had to do it; and now our sons will say when <p>they</p>'ve grown up that we're the ones who killed the man the gods once sent.
For then the wide world, replete w<p>it</p>h life, becomes lost property to him, And monstrous cravings stir w<p>it</p>hin his breast; no matter where <p>it</p> leaps, the scorching flame will clear the path ahead.
There too we'll find the light of heaven, and I will pray that <p>it</p> may shine companionably in your soul.

People think my money is there to make raids on, as if <p>it</p> were not a part of me, like a precious organ.

Doctor up some income tax, for which <p>they</p> got no case, to annoy me.
I send these shirts out and <p>they</p> come back in pieces.
I can't get my boots on when <p>they</p>'re hot.
- I imagine <p>they</p>'re talkin' to each other.
Which way did <p>they</p> go?

And therefore <p>it</p> would hide the body behind the curtain.
I mean, <p>they</p> say things to each other that <p>they</p> wouldn't tell their priest on their deathbed.
They tell me what I want to hear so <p>they</p> can get what <p>they</p> want.
And even if it were true, which it isn't, isn't this just simply a matter of... of people not... listening to a particular radio station that might be playing music... that <p>they</p> might not want heard played?
Soon as you turn your back, <p>they</p> do exactly what <p>they</p> want.
I'm sure that you and the other parents... have instilled in your children proper family values... so that <p>they</p> know what's right and what's wrong, so that no matter what <p>they</p> listen to, <p>they</p>'ll do the right thing.

I thought <p>they</p>'d always be there sighing into my moustache.
Things being as <p>they</p> are, there's a last time for everything. And I want to plan that final version.
How did <p>they</p> get here?
While we kill each other, <p>they</p> like to watch.
And yet <p>they</p> waited. All of us waited, because Arroyo wasn't ready.

This is what  <hon><p>they</p><hoff> 're talking about.
The machine is working. lt knows what <p>it</p>'s doing.
And <p>they</p>'re all in love with the same boy.
No boy comes here and takes my daughter out... unless I know who he is, where he lives, who his parents are... what <p>they</p> do for a living, where <p>they</p> go, for how long... and who <p>they</p>'re gonna be with.

Maybe <p>they</p>'ll adopt me.
I mean, there's something a tiny bit arrogant... about people going around feeling sorry for other people <p>they</p> consider less fortunate.
I wonder where <p>they</p> go.
It turns out that <p>they</p>'re not... - not such early risers.
You know, <p>it</p>'s possible that, to other people, the s<p>it</p>uation might not seem so ominous... as <p>it</p> does to you and me.

Are <p>they</p> the same?
How are <p>they</p> different?
I was about 13, 14 years old and I used to do it behind my family's back, just dressing up, till finally <p>they</p> caught on with it.
I mean, <p>they</p> go to the balls and <p>they</p> prove that <p>they</p> have potentials on actually selling a garment, OK.
Do <p>they</p> take you seriously?
Or, when <p>they</p> hear you're a model, how does their reaction change to you?
If you shoot an arrow and <p>it</p> goes real high... hooray for you.

Well, <p>they</p> were all at my place. In the café.
Let <p>it</p> blaze.
And <p>they</p> have to go through a thousand tortures.

If our wives find out we had some low-down brothers like that <p>they</p>'d divorce us.
Show 'em <p>they</p> can't get anyplace by shoving you around.
Wouldn't it be nice if <p>they</p> were?
Why don't Japanese women realize  <hon><p>they</p><hoff>  look nicer in kimono?
You'd think if <p>they</p> didn't have to work, <p>they</p>'d sit quiet and have a nice beer.
If the prosecution does not fear what a reopening would reveal why does <p>it</p> not take this easy means to defeat us?
Frankly, <p>they</p>'re... They're everything the defense has said <p>they</p> are.
Don't you think <p>they</p>'ve seen your picture and mine plastered all over the front pages?
The papers predicted <p>it</p> never would last
I'll have <p>it</p> fixed in five minutes.
Unless <p>they</p> can explain what <p>they</p> were doing there.
And that, to me, is the lowest thing of all, that you can deny that baby when <p>it</p> cries as <p>it</p> leaves your arms.
Oh, that's just what  <hon><p>they</p><hoff> 're hoping for, honey.
<p>they</p> will save lives and then are terrorized!
I try to contain them, but <p>they</p> begin to protest
Suppose there is a loss and suppose that <p>it</p> takes place between the hills and the hostel.
Were <p>they</p> pretty?
Half the time <p>they</p> don't vote.
The apartment may su<p>it</p> your convenience... but I doubt whether <p>it</p> will f<p>it</p> your convictions.
If you hadn't cared to give me your name and the money <p>they</p> wouldn't want Lanning to care.
Will <p>it</p> go on and on after, do you think?
Will <p>it</p> also remember Red's friends?
Yes, sir, but <p>it</p> wouldn't stay down.
If the tomb of Ananka were really found in the Hill of the 7 Jackals, wouldn't <p>it</p> be worth the museum's while to finance an exped<p>it</p>ion?
Yes and <p>it</p>'s going to stay new and nice.
Why, <p>they</p>'re squeezing this town through a sieve, borough by borough.
Perhaps you know the plant, how <p>it</p> wa<p>it</p>s for the warm sunshine and soft winds before <p>it</p> unfolds <p>it</p>s petals.
Then <p>they</p> throw it all away to run off to the city.
That's where <p>they</p> belong.
My, what a heavy shoe <p>it</p> is.
Instead, <p>they</p> will inspire us with an unbreakable determination to free ourselves and those who come after us from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down.

Where have  <hon><p>they</p><hoff>  gone?
Check the phone and see if <p>it</p>'s still working.
But <p>they</p>... <p>they</p> were happy!
Some women have had problems because <p>they</p>'ve overdone it.
Yes, <p>it</p> did. At ten o'clock <p>it</p> showed eight and <p>it</p> was 12:45.
Yes, but <p>it</p> doesn't...
But <p>they</p> are docile.

He sells gifts to the men while <p>they</p> wait for their sweethearts to come out.
Where could <p>it</p> be, now?
They take on an importance that completely overshadows... if you took the seats I'm building for the army, navy and Marine Corps and sat them side by side, <p>they</p>'d probably stretch from here to the...shores of Tripoli!
Try to see <p>it</p> for what <p>it</p> is:
