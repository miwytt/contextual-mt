See, paradise. I lost my virginity over here, when I was 26 And ten years ago the tsunami came. No warning. The wave was high as a house.

Why are you interested in that stuff? I thought you said UFOs were a crock. They are. But the fools that chase them can sometimes come up with something interesting. See?
That might just do it. But we need everything to be ready fast. The capacitor is old. It's failing. So all of the work you've been doing is to keep this running?
I don't think we can take this risk. If we stop it now, if we pull the plug, the energy will discharge safely, guaranteed. Everyone will be trapped, including Col. Baird. I think she'd be the first one to make that call. I promised I'd do the right thing.
What kind of stuff did you write? Well, my thesis was all poetry, actually. Can I read some? Oh, I don't have it anymore. My poetry is from a different life.
No offense. I only share spit with my man and my babies. I'll take it. Mother's Day Fair... expanded visitation... it fosters the inmates' connection to the outside world.
I only share spit with my man and my babies. I'll take it. Mother's Day Fair... expanded visitation... it fosters the inmates' connection to the outside world. These women forget they have lives on the outside, it affects how they behave in here.
He couldn't get that close, and then, if he knew the judge, he wouldn't... I mean, he just wouldn't do it. He's radical, but he's not nuts. Let me give you the final tidbit. A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.
Because if I'm not there to speak for the Cardinal, they'll kill him. Cromwell, I am content you are a burgess in the Parliament. My Lord. I spoke to the King for you and he is also content. You will take his instructions in the Commons - and mine.
Do not treat me like a hysterical wife. I am not a hysterical wife! Mo, you want to sit down, and we can talk about Th-- I'm not talking to you anymore, Benjamin Hershel Grossman! And do not call me, 'cause I will not pick up!
You can see that plainly enough in the lost letter technique, which I conceived of at Yale and was refined at Harvard. Leave a letter, a sealed, stamped letter but un-mailed, for someone else to find. Leave it on a sidewalk, inside a store, a phone booth. Put it under the windshield wipers of a parked car with a note saying, "Found near car." All letters are addressed to the same post office box.
Philip, they're here to teach, and you cannot ask them to waste their time. They should go back to their families, move on with their lives instead of being a horrible burden on everyone. Burden? Is it a burden to serve? Is it a burden to help someone in need?
Menti. Why aren't they here? I'll say it. Dear God, before we depart, we ask for thy watchful care. The journey we now feel prompted to take require thy protective hands.
How long does the psychosis last? Who knows? They're all - dead within two days anyway. - Not a very efficient pathogen. Seems to be doing a pretty fair job kicking our ass.
- Let's do this. - Oh, my God. But what do they know? They were taking their shirts off at work. Bow and I were fine.

Fight to the end. I'm impressed. I wish I could've spent more time with you. I have everything I need from you. I don't understand why you would care so much about these witches.
He didn't deserve it and then he used it against me! What's this now? You're rating people? Yeah, it's that site. Raters.
Heh, heh. I'm famous. Hear that? They say you have powers. What they call me, where you come from? The Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor. You know why they call me that?
Lost four head last night. Whole county will be ruined if that keeps up. You'll figure something out. Darling? But you must remember, such incantations are dangerous. And you must never speak the devil's language idly.
Are you going to fix that yourself? Of course. I'm good with stitching. So, women wear corsets so they don't exert themselves? Partly.
Not for flattery, or... my vanity... or anything under the sun. Now, please... go and take it off. The dress will look fine without it. Thank you. But I'll keep the shoes on if I may.
Good evening, Mr. Talbot. Yes. I have penetrated your fanciful stage name. Ethan Lawrence Talbot. Born the year of our Lord 1857 in the New Mexico Territory, enlisted in the United States Cavalry March the 2nd, 1882. Your complete War Department dossier is currently being ferreted out from thick ledgers in various departmental agencies in Washington.
I'm not going in there. You can't make me. I don't like it here. Well, I'm sorry, Marjorie, but I do. And I like those girls.
I said you were getting too involved with this, didn't I? I said you were getting that look in your eye. Oh, yes - because you're the expert in everything, aren't you, Vikram? Well... it's not me who's been suspended from practise. It's not my code of ethics that's being investigated.
How's Toni? He doesn't even hurt anymore. He has this big scar here. It itches like crazy so... he licks it like a dog. Is he mad at me?
There were new rules now, new reasons for him to call. He made choices and I obeyed. I let him press his thumb so hard into my neck that blue marks appeared. I let him bend my limbs ways they didn't go, and once his arm reared back and his fist landed with a thud on my collar bone, like sex, that didn't feel like anything I thought it would. He moved me where I had to go.
What? Of course you're gonna be sensitive to it. You have a right to be sensitive to it. You're a survivor of abuse. Hannah, I don't know what you're talking about.
You think that's how I wanted to dress five days a week? No, of course not. But no one gets the privilege of being themselves all the time, Carrie. No one. Now, if you want to go in there and upset her, I'm not gonna stop you.
Weddings, bar mitzvahs. You know, this one just specializes in corporate inquiry. Corporate inquiry... truly God's work. Everything's cool, buddy. He's just gonna come in, sit down with the inmates who eat kosher, have a little convo... get to know them.
It's not Trudy's Maple Logs. Yeah, but she has a plate of donuts. I know, but that's so stupid, because what does a maple log know about making donuts? It's like a totally different species. Well, does a donut have a self-awareness of what it means to be a donut that somehow makes it a more capable cook?
You know what? You really need to go fuck yourself. I need your advice. - I want 10% off the top. Your girls are rebelling.
That's Investment Fund Company, isn't it? They are 7 percent share holders of our company. A man named Praveen Shetty has purchased that company. What does he want? That chair.
If Joong-Ki is not here, that means Bak is not ready to... Tan-Wu! You sly old fox. Did I see you at Min-Ji's? Hey, sis, go get us a couple coffees. Come this way.
He was at the mercy of his creative flow. Sounds like you were at the mercy of it as well. I never minded. I just wanted him to feel free to do whatever he needed to do. I respected his process.
I want to leave something more than impressive report cards to remember me by. There is so much beauty in the world. And that's all that matters. Inspiration. Love.
And now you can't take not being close to me? You need to go. - Major... - No, just go, all right? The passionate mind is selfish.
This ball is their way of welcoming us. So clearly there can be no doubt about their loyalties? Actually, it is a bit unclear. Judge Shippen opposed the extension of royal authority, at least where taxation is concerned. But he also opposed last year's Pennsylvania constitution.
You will serve on full pay as a major. And all your debts will be cleared by the Crown. There is a valuable piece of royal property on a ship bound for New York. It is concealed inside a waxwork. - Concealed?
Franklin calls it an armonica. It mechanically recreates the tones made by rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine glass. So he mechanized a parlor trick. Perhaps, but this parlor is testament to the man's genius and industry. Take his lightning rod.
Mrs Grove does like to read the gossip columns. ~ She looks lovely. ~ Oh, that dress! Is it true it comes from Paris? Lady Mae's got a fashion house there.
Not to hear what I was saying, but for the moment when I couldn't go on, when I would shut up. Then she could kill me. I ran to the door. I wanted to slam it behind me and lock it.

You re fine. Yes, yes. You re doing just great. Thank you Doctor. Because I can t be sick with my film. I must have caught a cold.
None of you do! We know what needs to be done and we do it. We're the ones who live. You, you just sit and plan and hesitate. You pretend like you know when you don't.
What service? They make me give them oral in exchange for letting me stick around. What's the point of being a virgin anyways? Nobody cares when a guy loses it, but for some reason, it's this huge deal for girls. - Hey, what is that? - Smell of success.
They're closed? Yeah, by order of the Health Department, apparently. - How do you make unhealthy coffee? - Maybe it was the scones. Mm-hm. Heh. Listen, I got some shit in my fridge, like frozen gumbo, toasted waffles, eggs.
Cops investigating cops and making them heroes is why chief Cervantes formed civilian oversight. God, it really is good to see you. She likes you. She just kissed you on your gross, sweaty, hairy cheek. That's not gonna stop her from getting me fired or thrown in jail.
It's regarding a story we're airing on Wednesday night. Thank you. - Matley's here. - Yeah. I would say, based on our available handwriting evidence... yes, this is the same person. This signature on the June 24th document shows some conspicuous differences.
