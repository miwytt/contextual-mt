Supporting  Context  for  Ambiguous  Translations (SCAT) Dataset

The base contrastive data is from [Large-scale contrastive pronoun test set for EN-to-FR
](https://github.com/rbawden/Large-contrastive-pronoun-testset-EN-FR).
The ambiguous pronoun is marked with `<p> ... </p>` and contextual words selected by human translators are marked with `<hon> ... </hoff>`.
