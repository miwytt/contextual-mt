It's just <p>they</p>'ve fallen quite randomly, you'd really notice if one was gone?
But I gave one special attention to see if <p>it</p> would grow more.
The only question, Harold, is why <p>it</p> didn't protect you.
And why would <p>it</p> be on somebody's parking pass?
If the room is too hot, <p>they</p>'ll think it's spring.
The thing is, <p>it</p> has not been about what I need since the day that I had them.
<p>they</p> chart the same course, invade the same cells, wreak the same havoc.
Digging into victim number two's past, <p>it</p> turns out meth isn't the only thing Mark Coleman had done.
Ah, that's 'cause <p>it</p> f<p>it</p>s.
And <p>they</p>'ve been nothing but crap to me since I first came to town. No.
This finger looks burnt, but <p>it</p>'s not, <p>it</p>'s necrotic.
As such, I would have expected you to see the s<p>it</p>uation and understand <p>it</p> for what <p>it</p> is.
Everest over here wants to keep things just how <p>they</p> were.
Oh, yes, <p>they</p> are, with their hair and their thoughts, and...
Do you think things between us will go back to the way <p>they</p> usually are next week?
But I always wondered if <p>they</p> were smart enough to go back to their exact positions and put the tape back on so I wouldn't know.
And when we drive them off, what then? Will <p>they</p> not spread to other lands?
But <p>they</p> are fantastic, so I'm gonna call my friend at the New York Times and see if <p>they</p> want to order up reporting.
I hate to say it, but <p>they</p> just skim the surface.
I've been reusing the hot dog water so <p>it</p> gets more flavor.
Ms. Walker, those questions are inappropriate, and <p>they</p> are not helpful.
Yeah, well, <p>it</p> better.
How many tickets are <p>they</p> gonna buy?
Even so, <p>they</p> can only survive for less than ten minutes in the midday sun.
I thought she'd find <p>it</p> romantic.
We'll knock this town on <p>it</p>s ass and then kick <p>it</p> in the face if <p>it</p> even tries to fight back.
And I threw a rock at <p>it</p>, and <p>it</p> exploded.
But <p>it</p>'s a b<p>it</p> too high.
I'm making a l<p>it</p>tle money, and <p>it</p> is time for me to stand on my own two feet.
Then <p>it</p> did.
But when I left, <p>they</p> were fine.
I'm sure <p>it</p>'s a fake.
Look, <p>they</p> were kind of falling off your finger and so I kind of slid them off and then you moved your hand and I couldn't put them back on so...
Had <p>it</p> towed in.
These grasslands have been grazed and burned and have endured the harshest drought in generations... but with the rains, <p>they</p>'re beginning to recover.
I see things as <p>they</p> are.
Yes I'm saying the house looks cheap, because <p>it</p> is cheap!
The second he passed out, <p>they</p> would have fallen in his lap.
The hosp<p>it</p>al said  <hon><p>it</p><hoff>  was, uh, Lynch something.
They're sharp-edged... Burning... like <p>they</p>'re trying to eat the meat off my bones from the inside.
I want their info, <p>they</p>'re giving it to me straight up.
Don't make things any worse than <p>they</p> already are!
The rental is reasonable, that's why <p>it</p>'s very popular.
Of course <p>it</p> turns out he wanted a private jet to Tuscany.
The ice will be delivered at 1:00. Make sure <p>it</p>'s clean and chipped into pieces.
I'm well aware <p>it</p> sounds bananas. But looking at the fossil record, knowing what I know about this infection, you cannot say for certain <p>it</p> isn't what killed off the dinosaurs.
Well, you're certainly not talking about the algor<p>it</p>hm project, because <p>it</p> would be unthinkable for you to derail <p>it</p> at this point.
That's what <p>they</p>'re good for!
I do, but that's because Olivia... (Sighs) Let's just say that things aren't always as <p>they</p> seem.
Do you know where <p>it</p> is?
