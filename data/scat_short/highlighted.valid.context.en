ou said she'd speak, Liz. She changed her mind. Come on. Focus on the other women. Make sure they're ready.
Uh, we always want to make sure that our journeyline is, uh, on track. So, what do you think? What do you we think... is a very direct way to begin. So let's just start there. Thank jumping Jesus you're not charging me for this initial consult or you'd be hearing a goddamn dial tone.
Okay. I need a volunteer. I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? Bring back the girls!
I don't know what it's about. But regarding the Treasurer, you have every reason to be angry. I'd just like you to let it slide. Call the head of Special Branch in to explain. The current took the bag out into the fjord where we found it 12 metres down.
Go away! Back in your box! Go away! Anyway, the new film, The Monuments Men, what is it about? It is based on the true story of these rather unsung heroes of the Second World War, who were art historians and museum curators who were sent in after D-day, largely, to try and locate the art and treasures that the Nazis were spiriting away,
- Are you serious? - Yeah. Are we, like, less close now? Of course we're not less close. I mean, you moved out.
I got a CI who just identified Drazan's fence, Andre. Last name Padovkin. Buys and sells stolen merchandise out of a bodega in Red Hook. And unless you two want to duke it out first, I got the address. The pickup is registered to Drazan's neighbor.
Ivan, it's you that's the bastard. It's the baby that's the bastard. For God's sake, Ivan, at least get the word right. Katrina, listen. No, I will give the baby my name and it will see my face.
Getting people to organize-- rallies against Shoreham. There were many things that I didn't know at that time, that I've learned since. For one thing, it turn out, the ads were placed by the oil delivery industry. You know, the companies that deliver fuel to people on Long Island. And sure, the oil companies can say: "Go solar!"
Or anything that's a form of cnidarian, okay? It's a phobia, so just don't. [Laughs] Okay, okay. All right, fine. Let's review.
A reflection of the sky shimmers on the sands... a mirage. The sun is an illusionist. To thirsty travellers, a mirage can resemble a lake which agonisingly recedes as it's approached. And swaying camels coming to the rescue transform into dry, spiny acacia trees. To cross this confused, shimmering landscape, many swallows will need to find real water amongst the mirages.
- What were you doing in the woods? - A blood spell. - A cleansing spell. - To hide the king's brand. - I was getting rid of it.
- Horse hair. - Exactly. God, it's a tragedy. Yeah, I know the Truman girls. Everyone loves them.
What the fuck? - Carrie's on-site, right? Get her on the line. - Mmmmm. I understand you're feeling confused. You don't have a clue what I'm feeling. Brody, quitting is not an option.
Are you saying she is dead? Flower as she was... Death is now my heir. My daughter he has married. I will die and leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
And then, we'll explain everything. Okay? 30 seconds. Fee-fee. You call me that again, we don't tell you a thing. Holy Tilda Swinton! Where in the hell did he come from?
But you don't get seizures. Well, apparently seizures are a side effect for these pills that I'm also being paid to take. You really took my advice and went for it. I'm proud of you. (clattering) Look at you.
In Iceland, winter is never easy, but this year much of the pain is manmade. Last October, all three of Iceland's banks failed. Normally stoic and proper Icelanders have started protesting. In July 2009, WikiLeaks fueled a growing popular rage when it published a confidential internal memo from Kaupthing, the largest failed bank in the country. WikiLeaks had got hold of the Kaupthing loan book, which showed what was going on in a lot of those Icelandic banks. They had credit ratings which were completely at odds with their actual credit worthiness.
Well... (Sighs) The nurse made us watch a movie where a boy kept running around a track. It was boring, so Dillon Murray made an inappropriate shadow puppet, and everybody giggled and the nurse yelled at us. Yep, sounds about right. Then when she put the movie back on, the boy took a cheerleader roller skating and bought her some ice cream. After he got home, he took a long shower, and a doctor told us not to feel bad about our urges.
He's here. What do you see? By the divine in all, on the count of five, you will release her! The prophecy is coming true. And we have less time than I thought.
Oh, Ms. Berg. If it goes awry, it'll be background for my piece on you, but if the current Secretary of State sends her ex-husband to rescue a bunch of hostages in Iran and it works, I want that story. I-I need that story. We'll be in touch. Beautiful creatures, aren't they? Majestic, fearsome but still gentle.
- How is Sukar? - Still sleeping the deep sleep. We came here for more of his medicine and supplies. Now Earth Republic soldiers tell us we can't leave town. The great sickness has come.
Medicine, botany, agriculture, the total system: one planning system. (Narrator) it is actually better to build newer cities from the ground up than to restore and maintain old ones. Fresco uses a systems approach to designing new cities. They're desirable and pleasant places to live. The notion that intelligent overall planning implies mass uniformity is absurd.
Yes, I am. She's not here, lady. That's for free. Searchers search. All the bitches here are searching for love.
Sheldon brought me iced tea. Unfortunately, I hate iced tea. Violet. In the beginning, everyone's there. But people forget.
You know, a boy's got a problem, you take him to a ball game, you get him a hotdog-- they're copasetic. They're--they're good to go, and, I mean... Girls are--you gotta walk around on eggshells with 'em. I don't know, one day you're the king of the castle-- you know, they're just in love with you. You're their daddy.
Looks like it. What? I'm just thinking. Do you want a drawer? - What?
You're sorry? A man you loved... died. I'm sorry for your loss. I am a therapist, so I am supposed to know how these things work. I've counseled people through the five stages of grief.
So, first I wanna be 190 pounds with abs. Did it. Wanna be 210 with abs, did it. And I just keep pushin', and pushing', and pushing' it. I guess I was just never content, never happy with my body.
It's my so-called lawyer. Breaking news. In the wake of the exploding NYPD prostitution murder scandal, Police Commissioner Andrew Brady has just stepped down. The mayor accepted the commissioner's resignation, stating that recent events had cast a pall over the department. Quoting now: "Everyone in this city needs to know that the NYPD is above reproach."
Well, it was a bit unusual. Because of cutbacks in Jutland there were bottlenecks, so I was asked to do it. - Did you talk to the deputy attorney general? - No, not at all. The body was very damaged?
Like what? Dad wouldn't say. Must have been some serious crazy person stuff. There was a suicide letter too. They found it the next day.
- I live with her. - Gibbs? - No can do. - Why not? - No want to do.
Well, a different guy might take offense that you got him arrested. I'd say we're even. Oh, please. Not even close. Last time you gave me this flower, it represented our search for the music box. Our search for the u-boat treasure.
Humiliating myself in front of my boyfriend, not having any food to eat, or not having any power until tomorrow because all the fuses are blown? (Whispers) Take your pick. Well... we still have ambrosia salad, and the firemen said there's no major damage, and George... has been "looking for candle"" for 20 minutes. He's probably avoiding me until he can run screaming back to the city and never see me again. I can think of a bright side.
Before you start, I'm not going to go into detail about why Bea couldn't go to the funeral yesterday. It was security. But I do understand that we now have to go into serious damage control. Which is why I would like you to come back as peer worker. What about Doreen? Well, she can stay but right now, I need somebody with your experience mediating between us and the women.
Ridiculous child! Why, what a beautiful curtsey! But you know, Mr Moray meant only that Miss Audrey is in charge here. Indeed, she is very fearsome and awfully elegant, sometimes I quite feel like curtseying to her myself. Miss Audrey, may I have your permission to show the girls the gowns?
So when do I start? I don't remember offering you the job. Oh, but you were about to. What's the reason we're not staying in these offices? My father's name is on the building.
"Why don't they know I did it?" What if the kids never have to know? Don't you ever touch our children again. Don't you fucking ever go near them! 'I hear the ticking of the clock.
This is farewell. Even though all of you have changed the shape of your souls you are still lifeforms blessed with the Fruit of Knowledge. You were able to live for eternity but same as us you still cannot escape the fate of death. To advance the evolution of the flock burdened with death you had bestowed upon us the gift of civilization. As the representative of humanity I say thank you.
Sorry. This building is old and falling apart. Yes, we have that in common. Ha ha! Beat you to it.

I was alone with a man. He saw my head uncovered. You took off your sheytil? Yes. And your body.
Be careful. Tell rachel i'll see her soon. Keep an eye out for vincent. It's done. I'm ready to be fixed now.
What in the hell were you just talking about? Pretty handy with that hammer. Oh, I've used one a time or two in my life. Where'd you grow up? What's wrong, Patrick?
And there are a lot of things I'm looking forward to doing very soon. Well, hopefully not while we're sitting here at the table. Taylor heard back from Gloria. The float never made it to school. Wha... are you serious?
I call it a Mexican on the Moon. Hey, we're not out of champagne. I bought Mike and Molly a real nice bottle for a wedding present. We can't. Molly made us promise not to unwrap anything while she was gone.
Cole! Hey, listen, you... Oh, jeez. It's not even 7:00 A.M., guys. Have either of you even brushed your teeth yet?
If there are small ones... there are big ones. We have corn all around. We've got all we need here. What do you think? What do I think?
Us? Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Guess we should give the crowd what they want.
